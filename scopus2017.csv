In this retrospective study, we mainly analyzed the association between water iodine and thyroid cancer and discussed the possible cause of the increase in thyroid cancer. This study was supported by three hospitals in areas with different water iodine concentration. 5574 patients with thyroid disease were recruited, of which 1429 patients had been diagnosed with thyroid cancer. These samples collectively were used to analyze the relationship of incidence and prevalence associated with water iodine. In addition, the ratio of maximum tumor diameter was analyzed. By analyzing the proportion of patients with thyroid cancer in thyroid diseases, we found a decrease in the proportion of thyroid cancer with increasing water iodine (P < 0.0001). In addition, there was no significant correlation between the median water iodine and the prevalence of thyroid cancer, including papillary thyroid cancer (P > 0.05). Meanwhile, the 5 years' cumulative incidence of thyroid cancer increased with years (P < 0.01). Comparing Cao county and Shan county, which are areas with high water iodine, to adequate iodine area such as in Mudan district, an increasing incidence is observed in 2010–2014 in Mudan district. Again, we observed a significant increase in the proportion of thyroid cancer with tumor size < 1 cm (P < 0.01). Therefore, we concluded that cause(s) of increase in thyroid cancer may be ascribed to the sensitive diagnostic techniques and the improvement of living condition, but not water iodine. © 2017","Incidence; Retrospective study; Sensitive diagnosis; Thyroid cancer; Water iodine",Article,Scopus

A spatial autocorrelation method was used to evaluate the spatial relationship between the lung cancer morbidities from 2006 to 2009 and satellite-derived PM2.5 atmospheric levels. A comprehensive grey correlation degree analysis was carried out to assess the simultaneous and lag associations between the lung cancer morbidity and PM2.5 concentration. These relationships were subsequently applied to predict male lung cancer morbidity in a specific year. Annual mean PM2.5 levels in this specific year and previous 8 years were used as 9 independent variables to establish four statistical models. These models include ridge regression (RR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector regression (SVR), and the combined forecasting model (CFM) to predict the male lung cancer morbidity in China from 2010 to 2015. The model error evaluations suggested that the partial least squares regression model performed the best in the male lung cancer morbidity forecast. We calculated the male lung cancer morbidity by the optimal method among the established statistical forecasting models at 1948 sites in China. The gridded morbidity distribution from 2010 to 2015 across the country was obtained by Kriging interpolation method. Results showed that the male lung cancer morbidity increased significantly from western to eastern China, except for the far north region.

Additionally, understanding some of the environmental factors and their relationship to the occurrence of breast cancer was proposed for this study. Blood samples were collected from 50 women at ages between 21-71 years old, that suffered from breast cancer and 50 healthy women who are considered as a control group. The samples were placed in EDTA-based tubes. Then, the samples were kept frozen at -20 ̊C for later DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) laboratory procedures. The results of the mutation analyses of the CYP1A1 gene for the cancer and the healthy groups revealed that the occurrence frequencies of the homozygous wild type isoleucine/isoleucine were 52% and 26% respectively. While they were 42% and 60% respectively for the homozygous mutant Val/Val. Moreover, the heterozygous mutant Val/Ile type showed presence at 6% and 14% respectively. The statistical analyses confirmed that the incidence of the breast cancer could increase with genetic trait of the homozygous mutant Val/Val in a difference rate of 1.4 and confidence interval at 3.337-0.587. The findings of this study also declared that the women who carried the heterozygous mutant Val/Ile and their menstrual cycle started at the ages between 14-17 years old had 4 times of the risk factor of developing breast cancer. The study also revealed that there were no significant differences between the women who had breast cancer if they had early or late menopause. Finally, the study results showed that there was 3 times risk factor of developing breast cancer in uneducated women when linked to the genotypic trait Val/Ile in a difference rate of 3.2 and confidence interval of 40.057-0.265. It has been concluded that the risk factor of breast cancer was increased in the uneducated women in the presence of the Val/Ile genotype. This could be reasoned to the lifestyle of exposing to chemicals, paints, smoking, and many environmental carcinogens. © JK Welfare & Pharmascope Foundation | International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.","Breast cancer; CYP1A1 gene polymorphism; Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)",Article,Scopus

Early diagnosis is the most important single factor in combating oral cancer and improving the survival rate. Aim and objectives: To find out the prevalence of potentially malignant disorders (PMDs) of oral soft tissues in above 15 years age population and to find the biosocial determinants of PMDs of oral soft tissues. Material & Methods: Community based, cross sectional study, carried out in a randomly selected urban slum area of Agra, among 1254 individuals of more than 15 years of age. The individuals were interviewed, and oral cavity was examined to detect the PMDs of oral soft tissues. Results: The prevalence of PMDs of oral soft tissues was found 16.45%. Prevalence of sub mucosal fibrosis (SMF) is 10.61% followed by leukoplakia (5.11%) and erythroplakia 0.72%. Prevalence of PMDs in males is 23.22% which is much higher than females 8.24%. Prevalence of SMF is much higher in illiterates 19.01%. Unemployed individuals showed lower prevalence of PMDs i.e. 14.73% in comparison to semiskilled laborers 47.56%. PMD prevalence is higher in lower social classes 17.55%. Conclusion: Prevalence of PMDs is higher in males and illiterates. PMDs of oral soft tissues showed statistically significant increase in prevalence with advancing age. Statistically significantly lower prevalence is found in unemployed and housewives.

Determination of lung nodule malignancy is pivotal, because the early diagnosis of lung cancer could lead to a definitive intervention. According to the current international guidelines, size and growth rate represent the main indicators to determine the nature of a pulmonary nodule. However, there are some limitations in evaluating and characterising nodules when only their dimensions are taken into account. There is no single method for measuring nodules, and intrinsic errors, which can determine variations in nodule measurement and in growth assessment, do exist when performing measurements either manually or with automated or semi-automated methods. When considering subsolid nodules the presence and size of a solid component is the major determinant of malignancy and nodule management, as reported in the latest guidelines. Nevertheless, other nodule morphological characteristics have been associated with an increased risk of malignancy. In addition, the clinical context should not be overlooked in determining the probability of malignancy. Predictive models have been proposed as a potential means to overcome the limitations of a sized-based assessment of the malignancy risk for indeterminate pulmonary nodules. © ERS 2017.",,Article,Scopus

The numbers of breast cancer patients operated on in each center ranged from 120 to 904 per year. Breast conserving surgery (BCS) predominated in all but one center (range 50-70%). Immediate breast reconstructions (IBR) accounted for 6-42% of procedures, The most frequent type of IBR was either a two-stage expander followed by a permanent implant or one-stage implant- based with or without synthetic mesh. The most frequent type of delayed breast reconstruction (DBR) was a two- stage expander followed by implant- based reconstruction. None of the surveyed cancer centers performed free flap reconstruction. Deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps were performed in the plastic surgery department. Reconstructions based on pedicled flaps were performed in cancer centers. Acellular dermal matrices (ADM) and fat transfer were used in selected centers. In the clinical scenario of adjuvant radiotherapy, delayed breast reconstruction was favored. The full range of oncoplastic BCS was performed.

However, due to limited chemotherapeutic efficacy of current anticancer drugs, various natural products have been screened for novel alternative chemotherapeutic agents. Marine environment offers vast diversity of living organisms that provide compounds with impressive structural diversity and drug-like properties. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to determine the cytotoxic effects and mechanisms of cell death exerted by marine sponges on human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. Four species, namely Aaptos sp., Stryphuous ponderosus, Theonella sp. and Xestospongia sp, were selected for this study. Methanol extracts from three species produced potent cytotoxicity effects with IC50 values at 72hr of less than 30μg/ml in the order of Aaptos sp. > S. ponderosus > Theonella sp. Due to the lack of studies on S. ponderosus, extract from this species was then used to determine its mechanisms of cell death. MCF-7 cell death exerted by the extract was found to be mediated by apoptosis based on the presence of DNA fragmentation in treated cells. Treatment of cells with the extract increased the levels of of caspase 3 suggesting that the protein was responsible in triggering the DNA fragmentation. In addition, the extract also induced the levels of caspases 8 and 9 and the levels of caspase 8 was higher than the latter suggesting that extrinsic was the major pathway that involved in inducing apoptosis. The apoptotic-induced cytototoxicity activity of the methanol extract of S. ponderosus may be due to the presence alkaloid and terpenoid compounds, and thus, may have the potential to be developed further as candidates for chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of breast cancer. © JK Welfare & Pharmascope Foundation | International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.","Apoptosis; Breast cancer; Caspases; Marine extract; S. ponderosus",Article,Scopus

There was also evidence of γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH) use in the theatre (max γ-HCH in air of 56 ng m− 3). Yet, the cancer risk (CR) from occupational exposure via inhalation (Expi) to OCPs in the theatre was low (CR &lt; 4.0 × 10− 6). γ-HCH was found at elevated levels in air of the museum (max γ-HCH in air of 15,000 ng m− 3). CR from Expi in the museum was moderate to high (&gt; 1 × 10− 4). Our results show the CR through Expi to OCPs in buildings, such as museums can still be significant enough to warrant mitigation measures, e.g., remediation. © 2017","Human health (cancer) risk; Inhalation exposure; Organochlorine pesticide; Remediation",Article,Scopus

Despite the retrospective nature of most of the studies and the lack of randomised studies, a substantial body of literature today allows us to evaluate to what extent lung function decreases after segmentectomy and whether segmentectomy offers a real functional benefit over lobectomy. From the available series, it emerges that the mean decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) is low, ranging from −9% to −24% of the initial value within 2 months and −3 to−13% 12 months after segmentectomy. This reduction in lung function is significantly lower than that induced by lobectomy, but saves only a few per cent of pre-operative FEV1. Moreover, the published results do not firmly establish the functional benefit of segmentectomy over lobectomy in patients with poor lung function. Some issues remain to be addressed, including whether video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) segmentectomy may preserve lung function better than VATS lobectomy in patients with poor lung function, especially within the early days after surgery, and whether this may translate to lowering the functional limit for surgery. Eventually, trials comparing stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy, radiofrequency ablation and segmentectomy functional consequences are warranted. © ERS 2017.",,Review,Scopus

Although the mechanisms behind this observation are not clear, established drivers of carcinogenesis in COPD include oxidative stress and sustained chronic inflammation. Mitochondria are critical in these two processes and recent evidence links increased oxidative stress in COPD patients to mitochondrial damage. We therefore postulate that mitochondrial damage in COPD patients leads to increased oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, thereby increasing the risk of carcinogenesis. The functional state of the mitochondrion is dependent on the balance between its biogenesis and degradation (mitophagy). Dysfunctional mitochondria are a source of oxidative stress and inflammasome activation. In COPD, there is impaired translocation of the ubiquitin-related degradation molecule Parkin following activation of the Pink1 mitophagy pathway, resulting in excessive dysfunctional mitochondria. We hypothesise that deranged pathways in mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy in COPD can account for the increased risk in carcinogenesis. To test this hypothesis, animal models exposed to cigarette smoke and developing emphysema and lung cancer should be developed. In the future, the use of mitochondria-based antioxidants should be studied as an adjunct with the aim of reducing the risk of COPD-associated cancer. © ERS 2017.",,Review,Scopus

However, these efforts are hampered in urban areas where the built environment obstructs aerial data collection. To address part of this limitation, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of using in situ gamma readings (taken with a scintillation probe attached to a ratemeter) to assess radon potential in an urban environment: DeKalb County, part of the Atlanta metropolitan area, Georgia, USA. After taking gamma measurements at 402 survey sites, empirical Bayesian kriging was used to create a continuous surface of predicted gamma readings for the county. We paired these predicted gamma readings with indoor radon concentration data from 1351 residential locations. Statistical tests showed the interpolated gamma values were significantly but weakly positively related with indoor radon concentrations, though this relationship is decreasingly informative at finer geographic scales. Geology, gamma readings, and indoor radon were interrelated, with granitic gneiss generally having the highest gamma readings and highest radon concentrations and ultramafic rock having the lowest of each. Our findings indicate the highest geogenic radon potential may exists in the relatively undeveloped southeastern part of the county. It is possible that in situ gamma, in concert with other variables, could offer an alternative to aerial radioactivity measurements when determining radon potential, though future work will be needed to address this project's limitations. © 2017","Gamma; Geology; Public health; Radiation; Radon",Article,Scopus

In clinical practice, considerable emphasis is placed on the importance of making treatment decisions guided by each patient’s risk status, which should be assessed using multiple prognostic parameters. As PAH is a progressive disease, regular assessments are essential to ensure that any change in risk is detected in a timely manner and treatment is adjusted accordingly. With the availability of therapies that target three different pathogenic pathways, combination therapy is now the standard of care. For most patients, this involves dual combination therapy with agents targeting the endothelin and nitric oxide pathways.

However, a significant part of this energy is dissipated as heat. Plasmonic losses present a major hurdle in the development of plasmonic devices and circuits that can compete with other mature technologies. Until recently, they have largely kept the use of plasmonics to a few niche areas where loss is not a key factor, such as surface-enhanced Raman scattering and biochemical sensing. Here, we discuss the origin of plasmonic losses and various approaches to either minimize or mitigate them based on understanding of fundamental processes underlying surface plasmon modes excitation and decay. Along with the ongoing effort to find and synthesize better plasmonic materials, optical designs that modify the optical powerflow through plasmonic nanostructures can help in reducing both radiative damping and dissipative losses of surface plasmons. Another strategy relies on the development of hybrid photonic-plasmonic devices by coupling plasmonic nanostructures to resonant optical elements. Hybrid integration not only helps to reduce dissipative losses and radiative damping of surface plasmons, but also makes possible passive radiative cooling of nanodevices. Finally, we review emerging applications of thermoplasmonics that leverage Ohmic losses to achieve new enhanced functionalities.

Material/Methods: A total of 181 patients underwent surgery because of suspected cardiac tumor in our institution between 1998 and 2016. In 162 cases, the diagnosis was confirmed postoperatively and these patients were included in this study. Preoperative baseline characteristics, operative data, and postoperative early and long-term outcomes were analyzed. Results: Mean age at presentation was 56.6±17.6 years, and 95 (58.6%) patients were female. There were 126 (77.8%) patients with benign cardiac tumors, while the remaining patients had malignant tumors (primary and metas-tasized). The mean follow-up time was 5.2±4.7 years. The most frequent histologically verified tumor type was myxoma (63%, n=102). In terms of malignant tumors, various types of sarcomas presented most primary malignant cardiac tumors (7.4%, n=12). The mean ICU length of stay was 1.7±2.2 days and overall in-hospital mortality was 3.1% (n=5). Frequent postoperative complications included mediastinal bleeding (5.8%, n=9), wound infection (1.3%, n=2), acute renal failure (5.6%, n=9), and major cerebrovascular events (n=7, 4.6%). The overall cumulative survival after cardiac tumor resection was 94% at 30 days, 85% at 1 year, 72% at 5 years, and 59% at 15 years. Conclusions: Surgical treatment of cardiac tumors is a safe and highly effective strategy associated with good early and long-term outcomes. © Med Sci Monit.","Cardiac surgical procedures; Heart neoplasms; Patient outcome assessment",Article,Scopus

Several methods for diagnosing cancer have been discovered and many more are currently being developed. Conventional clinical approaches to detecting cancers are based on a biopsy followed by histopathology, or on the use of biomarkers (protein levels or nucleic acid content). Biopsy is the most widely used technique; however, it is an invasive technique and is not always applicable. Furthermore, biomarker-based detection cannot be relied on when the biomarkers are present in an extremely low concentration in the body fluids and in malignant tissues. Thus, in recent years highly sensitive and robust new cancer diagnosis techniques have been developed for clinical application, and may offer an alternative strategy for cancer diagnosis. As such, this book gathers the latest point-of-care cancer diagnostic methods and protocols based on biomedical sensors, microfluidics, and integrated systems engineering. It also discusses recent developments and diagnostics tests that can be conducted outside the laboratory in remote areas. These technologies include electrochemical sensors, paper-based microfluidics, and other kit-based diagnostic methods that can be adapted to bring cancer detection and diagnostics to more remote settings around the globe. Overall, the book provides students, researchers, and clinicians alike a comprehensive overview of interdisciplinary approaches to cancer diagnosis. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

Indeed, recent evidence indicates that endocannabinoids influence the intracellular events controlling the proliferation and apoptosis of numerous types of cancer cells, thereby leading to both in vitro and in vivo antitumour effects. Also, the endogenous ligand arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide; AEA) inhibits the proliferation of human breast cancer cells by blocking the G0/G1-S-phase transition of the cell cycle through interference with cannabinoid CB1 receptor-coupled signal-transducing events. The present review shows that cannabinoids exert their anti-cancer effects in a number of ways and in a variety of tissues. Furthermore, the novel therapeutic application of cannabinoids in cancer disease, described here, strongly support the idea that cannabinoids may induce benefical effect in cancer treatment. © 2017, SILAE (Italo-Latin American Society of Ethnomedicine).

MicroRNA-219-5p (miR-219-5p) has been suggested as a novel tumor suppressing miRNA for many types of human cancers. However, the expression and functional significance of miR-219-5p in epithelial ovarian cancer remain poorly understood. In this study, we sought to explore the potential functions of miR-219-5p in epithelial ovarian cancer. Herein, we found that miR-219-5p levels were significantly decreased in epithelial ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. Further experiments showed that overexpression of miR-219-5p inhibited epithelial ovarian cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and suppressed the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. By contrast, suppression of miR-219-5p exhibited the opposite effects. Twist was identified as a downstream target of miR-219-5p, and its expression was directly regulated by miR-219-5p. Restoration of Twist expression in miR-219-5p-overexpresing cells significantly reversed the antitumor effects of miR-219-5p. Taken together, our results revealed a tumor suppressive role for miR-219-5p in epithelial ovarian cancer that includes suppression of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through downregulation of the Twist/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Our study suggests that miR-219-5p may have potential applications in the diagnosis and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Epithelial ovarian cancer; miR-219-5p; Twist; Wnt",Article,Scopus

Many computerized techniques have been reported in the literature to diagnose and classify the disease with satisfactory skin cancer detection performance. However, reducing the false detection rate is still challenging and preoccupying because false positives trigger the alarm and require intervention by an expert pathologist for further examination and screening. In this paper, an automatic skin cancer diagnosis system that combines different textural and color features is proposed. New textural and color features are used in a bag-of-features approach for efficient and accurate detection. We particularly claim that the Histogram of Gradients (HG) and the Histogram of Lines (HL) are more suitable for the analysis and classification of dermoscopic and standard skin images than the conventional Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) and the Histogram of Oriented Lines (HOL), respectively. The HG and HL are bagged separately using a codebook for each and then combined with other bagged color vector angles and Zernike moments to exploit the color information. The overall system has been assessed through intensive experiments using different classifiers on a dermoscopic image dataset and another standard dataset. Experimental results have shown the superiority of the proposed system over state-of-the-art techniques. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Dermoscopic images; Malignant melanoma; Skin cancer diagnosis; Standard skin images; Textural and color features",Review,Scopus

Material and methods: We enrolled 225 patients, aged 26-92 years (mean, 63 years). There were 149 women (66%) and 76 men (34%). All patients filled out a survey regarding risk factors of head and neck cancer (HNC), including symptoms and lifestyle characteristics. Subsequently, all participants underwent a complete laryngological examination. Results: Among the studied patients, we found the following lifestyle-related risk factors of HNC: Tobacco use (22%), alcohol use more than 1 time per week (12%), oral sex (17%), multiple sexual partners (10%), rare dental checkups (24%), and dental prostheses (45%). The most frequent symptoms that prompted the patients to report for screening exams were as follows: chronic hoarseness (64%), xerostomia (39%), dysphagia (37%), nasal congestion (6%), and neck tumor (5%). Further imaging studies were ordered in 15 patients (7%), fiberoscopy in 25 (11%), and lesion excision in 18 (8%). Among the studied patients, 17 were referred for further oncological treatment, of whom 14 had benign tumors and 4 malignant tumors. Conclusions: The Head and Neck Cancer Awareness campaign increased the awareness of HNC, and it should systematically encompass people at increased risk. By implementing this program in our department, we were able to detect and initiate early treatment in 7.5% of the screened people. However, appropriate workup and treatment require funding and therefore systemic measures should be taken to enable a wide implementation of such screening programs.","European head and neck cancer awareness week; Head and neck tumors",Article,Scopus

Material: There was performed retrospective analysis of 97 patients, aged 17 to 88 years, mean age of 60.3 years. The analysis included data from subjective study, physical examination, image and histopathological studies Results: Almost all cases were lymphoid neoplasms - 95 patients (98%). B cell lymphoma was the most commonly diagnosed lymphoma - 74 cases (76%), followed by Hodgkin's lymphoma- 19 cases (20%). Only two patients had T-cell lymphoma (2%). There was observed prevalence among women, K: M ratio for the whole group was 51: 46, while male predominance was reported in Hodgkin's lymphoma patients (K: M = 7: 12). Over the 15-year period, there was an increase in the number of lymphoid tumors. The most common location on the neck were lymph nodes - 71 (73.2%). Extranodal localizations (26.8%) were most often associated with salivary glands: parotid and submandibular involvement and with the dominant lymphoma of the marginal zone MALT (14 cases). In 57% of patients the fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) results were false, with positive results only in 32% of patients. Conclusions: Tumors from lymphoid tissue in the neck region are most commonly B-cell lymphomas or Hodgkin,s lymphomas. Non-specific clinical signs and non-specific radiological images, as well as non-diagnostic results o FNAB, make it difficult to effectively differentiate lymphomas with cancer metastasis in neck lymph nodes.

Considering that nuclear accumulation and constitutive activation of MEK/ERK not only promotes tumor progression directly, but also induces chronic inflammation, we wonder whether and how RBJ impairs host immune-surveillance via chronic inflammation and consequently supports tumor progression. Here, we report that higher expression of RBJ in human breast cancer tissue has been significantly correlated with poorer prognosis in breast cancer patients. The forced expression of RBJ promotes tumor growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, more accumulation of immune suppressive cells but less antitumor immune cell subpopulations were found in spleen and tumor tissue derived from RBJ forceexpressed tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, forced RBJ expression significantly promotes tumor cell production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 by constitutive activating MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Accordingly, RBJ knockdown significantly decreases tumor growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo, with markedly reduced production of IL-6. Administration of anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibody could reduce MDSCs accumulation in tumor tissue in vivo. Therefore, our results demonstrate that RBJ-mediated nuclear constitutive activation of ERK1/2 leads to persistent production of IL-6 and increase of MDSCs recruitment, contributing to promotion of tumor growth and metastasis. These results suggest that RBJ contributes to tumor immune escape, maybe serving a potential target for design of antitumor drug. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","IL-6; Immune escape; MDSCs; Small GTPase; Tumor metastasis",Article,Scopus

Materials and methods: Between 2006 and 2016, 149 patients with parotid gland tumors were treated in our department. Our report is based on medical records, histopathological examinations, and surgery reports. Results: We found 126 benign and 23 malignant tumors, and both tumor types were seen more frequently in men. The mean age of all patients was 58.3 years; it was 65.5 years for patients with malignant tumors and 56.9 years for those with benign tumors. Among the analyzed patients, the peak incidence was seen in the age range of 60-69 years. Moreover, this age range was approximately the same for all tumors and benign tumors, whereas for malignant tumors it was 70-79 years. Benign tumors were significantly more frequent, and comprised 84.56% of all tumors. The most common benign tumors were pleomorphic adenoma and adenolymphoma, accounting for 93.66% of cases. The most common malignant tumors were as follows: polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (26.07%), NOS adenocarcinoma (13.04%), and acinic cell carcinoma (13.04%). The most common treatment modality was standalone surgery. Conclusions: Our retrospective analysis is in line with previous national and international studies.

We have shown that four intravesical treatments with a simple co-formulation of interleukin-12 and the biopolymer chitosan not only destroy orthotopic bladder tumors, but also promote a potent long-lasting systemic immune response as evidenced through tumor-specific in vitro killing assays, complete protection from rechallenge, and abscopal antitumor responses at distant non-treated tumors. This study investigates the immunological kinetics underlying these results. We show through depletion studies that CD8C T cells are required for initial tumor rejection, but CD4C T cells protect against rechallenge. We also show that even a single intravesical treatment can eliminate tumors in 50% of mice with 6/9 and 7/8 mice eliminating tumors after three or four treatments respectively. We then performed immunophenotyping studies to analyze shifts in immune cell populations after each treatment within the tumor itself as well as in secondary lymphoid organs. These studies demonstrated an initial infiltration of macrophages and granulocytes followed by increased CD4C and CD8C effector-memory cells. This was coupled with a decreased level of regulatory T cells in peripheral lymph nodes as well as decreased myeloid-derived suppressor cell infiltration in the bladder. Taken together, these data demonstrate the ability of properly delivered interleukin-12-based therapies to engage adaptive immunity within the tumor itself as well as throughout the body and strengthen the case for clinical translation of chitosan/ interleukin-12 as an intravesical treatment for bladder cancer. © Sean G.

To circumvent the challenges of cellular immunotherapeutics, we developed clinically translatable nanoliposomes that can be combined with tumor-derived RNA to generate personalized tumor RNA-nanoparticles (NPs) with considerable scale-up capacity. RNA-NPs bypass MHC restriction, are amenable to central distribution, and can provide near immediate immune induction. We screened commercially available nanoliposomal preparations and identified the cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) as an efficient mRNA courier to antigen-presenting cells (APCs). When administered intravenously, RNA-NPs mediate systemic activation of APCs in reticuloendothelial organs such as the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. RNA-NPs increase percent expression of MHC class I/II, B7 co-stimulatory molecules, and maturation markers on APCs (all vital for T-cell activation). RNA-NPs also increase activation markers on tumor APCs and elicit potent expansion of antigen-specific T-cells superior to peptide vaccines formulated in complete Freund's adjuvant. We demonstrate that both model antigen-encoding and physiologically-relevant tumor-derived RNA-NPs expand potent antitumor T-cell immunity. RNA-NPs were shown to induce antitumor efficacy in a vaccine model and functioned as a suitable alternative to DCs in a stringent cellular immunotherapy model for a radiation/temozolomide resistant invasive murine high-grade glioma. Although cancer vaccines have suffered from weak immunogenicity, we have advanced a RNA-NP formulation that systemically activates host APCs precipitating activated T-cell frequencies necessary to engender antitumor efficacy. RNA-NPs can thus be harnessed as a more feasible and effective immunotherapy to re-program host-immunity. © Elias J.

This regulation of the immune microenvironment favors immune tolerance to the neoplastic cells. In this study, we have investigated the prognostic role of immune-checkpoint expression markers in a cohort of resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. RNA was isolated from fresh-frozen lung specimens (tumor and normal lung) (n D 178). RTqPCR was performed to analyze the relative expression of 20 immune-related genes that were normalized by the use of endogenous genes selected by GeNorm algorithm. Patients with higher expression levels of IL23A and LGALS2 presented better outcomes. In the clustering expression patterns, we observed that patients with higher expression of immunoregulatory genes had better survival rates. Additionally, these data were used to develop a gene expression score. Since CTLA4 and PD1 were associated with prognosis based on Cox regression analysis (Z-score > 1.5), a multivariate model including these two genes was created. Absolute regression coefficients from this analysis were used in order to calculate the immunecheckpoint score: (PD1£0.116) C (CTLA4£0.059) for each case. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed that patients with high immune-checkpoint score have longer overall survival (OS) [NR vs. 40.4 mo, p D 0.008] and longer relapse-free survival (RFS) [82.6 vs. 23 mo, p D 0.009]. Multivariate analysis in the entire cohort indicated that the immune-checkpoint score was an independent biomarker of prognosis for OS [HR: 0.308; 95% CI, 0.156–0.609; p D 0.001] and RFS [HR: 0.527; 95% CI, 0.298–0.933; p D 0.028] in early-stage NSCLC patients. In conclusion, this score provides relevant prognostic information for a better characterization of early stage NSCLS patients with strikingly different outcomes and who may be candidates for immune-based therapies. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Biomarker; Checkpoint score; NSCLC; Prognostic",Article,Scopus

Recent evidences have shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in a diverse range of biological functions. However, research on the effects of UV irradiation on lncRNA expression in epidermal cells is limited. The aim of this study was to identify changes in the expression profile of lncRNAs after UVB irradiation. To accomplish this, we performed a microarray analysis of both mRNA and lncRNA expression levels in irradiated skin cells. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs showed that the expression of immune response- and cell membrane-related genes was up-regulated, while cell-cell adhesion-associated genes were down-regulated by UVB irradiation. Moreover, we found that lncRNAs up-regulated by UVB irradiation were associated with the regulation of gene transcription, while lncRNAs down-regulated by UVB irradiation were associated with tumorigenesis. Finally, we compiled a list of the lncRNAs that showed the strongest association with the development of non-melanoma skin cancers caused by UV exposure. These findings lay a foundation for future investigations into the expression patterns of lncRNAs with roles in the response to UV irradiation and in non-melanoma skin cancers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Keratinocyte; Long non-coding RNA; Ultraviolet B",Article,Scopus

WHO classification divides lymphomas into two main types, i.e. Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), with numerous subtypes. The majority of MLs are localized in lymph nodes, but extranodal locations are also possible. MLs represent approximately 3-5% of all malignant neoplasms in Poland, but their incidence has been increasing in recent years, especially in young patients. The objective of the study was to evaluate clinical manifestations and diagnostic process in patients with malignant lymphomas of the head and neck region as diagnosed in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the Medical University of Lodz in years 2013-2017. Material and method: 30 patients diagnosed with malignant lymphomas of the head and neck region at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the Medical University of Lodz in 2013-2017. Results: The study group consisted of 8 cases of nodal lymphomas and 22 cases of extranodal lymphomas. In 29 cases B-cell lymphomas were diagnosed. The most common symptoms included lymphadenopathy or neck tumor. Other symptoms were associated with the location of tumors in particular body organs. The diagnosis was based on histopathological examination of biopsy (needle or surgical) samples. Conclusion: Malignant lymphomas should be taken into account during differential diagnosis of the tumor or lymphadenopathy of the neck. The diagnosis is difficult because of the nonspecificity of symptoms and the need for interdisciplinary cooperation of many specialists.","Extranodal lymphoma; Head and neck neoplasm; Malignant lymphoma",Article,Scopus

Currently, coolants such as solid carbon dioxide and liquid nitrogen are used to preserve good morphology of the tissue. Using these coolants, snap freezing of tissues for diagnostic and research purposes is often time consuming, laborious, even hazardous and not user friendly. For that reason snap-freezing is not routinely applied at the location of biopsy acquisition. Furthermore, the influence of optimal cooling rate and cold sink temperature on the viability of the cells is not well known. In this paper, a snap-freezing apparatus powered by a small cryocooler is presented that will allow bio-medical research of tissue freezing methods and is safe to use in a hospital. To benchmark this apparatus, cooldown of a standard aluminum cryo-vial in liquid nitrogen is measured and the cooling rate is about -25 K/s between 295 K and 120 K. Sufficient cooling rate is obtained by a forced convective helium gas flow through a gap formed between the cryo-vial and a cold surface and is therefore chosen as the preferred cooling method.

Caveolin-1 (Cav1) and Rho/ROCK pathway play important roles in tumor metastasis, separately. However, less research was focused on the relationship between Cav1 and Rho/ROCK in ECSS metastasis. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between Cav1 and Rho/ROCK pathway in ESCC metastasis. Material/Methods: Cav1 and phosphorylated Cav1 (PY14Cav1) were examined in ESCC and in adjacent and non-tumorous tissues from ESCC patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Cav1 or Rho/ROCK inhibitor was used to treat EC109, Eca109, TE1, and TE13 cells. Western blotting (WB) was used to detect Cav1 and PY14Cav1 expression. The wound healing scratch test and transwell assays were used to assess migration and invasion. Results: Cav1 and PY14Cav1 were gradually expressed at higher levels in ECSS than in adjacent and non-tumor tissues as ESCC stage and lymphatic metastasis increased, and this difference was significant (P<0.05). Cav1 was expressed at higher levels in TE1 and TE13 than in EC109 and Eca109, while PY14Cav1 was enhanced in TE1 and TE13 cells but not in EC109 and Eca109, and the difference was significant (P<0.05). TE1 and TE13 had significantly (P<0.05) stronger motility, migratory, and invasion abilities than EC109 and Eca109 cells. Silencing Cav1 decreased PY14Cav1 expression in TE1 and TE13 cells, as well as suppressing the migration and invasion of all ECSS cells, and these differences were significant (P<0.05). Suppressing the Rho/ROCK pathway obviously inhibited Cav1 and PY14Cav1 expressions, as well as significantly (P<0.05) decreasing migration and invasion of ESCC cells. Conclusions: Cav1 and PY14Cav1 were positively correlated with ESCC lymphatic metastasis and cancer stages. Rho/ROCK pathway activation promoted ESCC metastasis by regulating Cav1. © Med Sci Monit.","Caveolin 1; Cell migration assays; Neoplasm invasiveness; Neoplasms, squamous cell; Signal transduction",Article,Scopus

Here, we used chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to enhance the activity of NK cells against Ewing sarcomas (EwS) in a tumor antigenspecific manner. Expression of CARs directed against the ganglioside antigen GD2 in activated NK cells increased their responses to GD2C allogeneic EwS cells in vitro and overcame resistance of individual cell lines to NK cell lysis. Second-generation CARs with 4-1BB and 2B4 co-stimulatory signaling and third generation CARs combining both co-stimulatory domains were all equally effective. By contrast, adoptive transfer of GD2-specific CAR gene-modified NK cells both by intratumoral and intraperitoneal delivery failed to eliminate GD2-expressing EwS xenografts. Histopathology review revealed upregulation of the immunosuppressive ligand HLA-G in tumor autopsies from mice treated with NK cells compared to untreated control mice. Supporting the relevance of this finding, in vitro co-incubation of NK cells with allogeneic EwS cells induced upregulation of the HLA-G receptor CD85j, and HLA-G1 expressed by EwS cells suppressed the activity of NK cells from three of five allogeneic donors against the tumor cells in vitro. We conclude that HLA-G is a candidate immune checkpoint in EwS where it can contribute to resistance to NK cell therapy. HLA-G deserves evaluation as a potential target for more effective immunotherapeutic combination regimens in this and other cancers. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Chimeric antigen receptors; Ewing sarcoma; HLA-G; Inhibitory immune checkpoints; NK cells",Review,Scopus

The interest of this problem lies in the fact that it can represent the destruction of a solid tumor by a population of immune cells. The theory of curves is utilized to derive the rate at which the area of the set decreases. Firstly, the process is represented as a discrete dynamical system. A recurrence equation describing the shrinkage of the area at any step is deduced. Then, a continuum limit is attained to derive an ordinary differential equation that governs the decay of the set. The solutions to the differential equation and its implications are discussed, and numerical simulations are carried out to test the accuracy of the decay law. Finally, the dynamics of a tumor-immune aggregate is inspected using this law and the theory of bifurcations. As the ratio of immune destruction to tumor growth increases, a saddle-node bifurcation stabilizes the tumor-free fixed point. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Bifurcation analysis; cancer dynamics; geometry of curves; mathematical modeling; nonlinear systems",Article,Scopus

The selection of PSE provides visualization and characterization of individual CNTs based on its strong luminescence. In addition, we designed a simple and efficient electrode with a staggered pattern to increase the effect of electrophoresis by using electric field for the macroscopic alignment of CNTs to complete a field-effect device for CNT-based biosensors. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the morphology of the biosensors. The results of four-point probe method demonstrated high selectivity and sensitivity of detection. The functionalization of SWNTs was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).

Alterations of splicing processes, caused by DNA mutations, result in aberrant splicing and the formation of aberrant mRNA isoforms. Analyses of hereditary cancer predisposition genes reveal many DNA variants with unknown clinical significance (VUS) that potentially affect pre-mRNA splicing. Therefore, a comprehensive description of ASVs is an essential prerequisite for the interpretation of germline VUS in high-risk individuals. To identify ASVs in a gene of interest, we have proposed an approach based on multiplex PCR (mPCR) amplification of all theoretically possible exon-exon junctions and subsequent characterization of size-selected and pooled mPCR products by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The efficiency of this method is illustrated by a comprehensive analysis of BRCA1 ASVs in human leukocytes, normal mammary, and adipose tissues and stable cell lines. We revealed 94 BRCA1 ASVs, including 29 variants present in all tested samples. While differences in the qualitative expression of BRCA1 ASVs among the analyzed human tissues were minor, larger differences were detected between tissue and cell line samples. Compared with other ASV analysis methods, this approach represents a highly sensitive and rapid alternative for the identification of ASVs in any gene of interest. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Alternative splicing; BRCA1; mRNA splicing variant; Multiplex PCR; NGS",Article,Scopus

However, the lack of integration between the radiologist and CAD systems restrains the rate of progress as well as the reach of such advancements in clinical use. This article aims to improve the clinical efficiency of ultrasound based CAD systems for classification of breast lesions by integrating back-propagation artificial neural network (BPANN), support vector machine (SVM) and radiologist feedback. The acquired breast ultrasound images were subjected to wavelet based filtering in order to reduce speckle noise followed by feature extraction, feature selection and classification. Experiments on a database of 178 ultrasound images of breast anomalies (88 benign and 90 malignant) show that the proposed methodology achieves classification accuracy of 98.621% and 98.276%, respectively, when all 457 and 19 most relevant features selected by multi-criteria feature selection method were used for classification. The accuracy achieved is significantly higher than that using conventional classifiers based on BPANN and SVM. Further, it is found that integrating expert opinion in CAD systems improves its overall performance.

In this study, chitosan with different molecular weights was chosen to prepare chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) as gene vector by ionic cross-linking with tripolyphosphate (TPP). CSNPs were characterized in terms of particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index (PDI) by the Zetasizer, and morphology was detected with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, the cytotoxicity and biocompatibility of CSNPs were correspondingly examined by MTT assay and the muscle slices of mice. The transfer effect on plasmids and siRNA was evaluated. Agarose gel electrophoresis method and spectrophotometry were used to detect the loading efficiency. The cell transfection efficiency of plasmids or siRNA loaded by CSNPs was analyzed by the fluorescence microscopy, laser scanning confocal microscopy or flow cytometry. The blood compatibility was analyzed by hemolytic experiment and full-automatic blood coagulator. Results showed that when CS(160 kDa) was 1 mg/mL with TTP(mass ratio was 10:1), CSNPs were prepared successfully by ionic gelation method, which had smaller particle size (about 100 nm), stable dispersibility, high gene loading efficiency and spheroidal particles with morphological rules under TEM. Their cytotoxicity is at the 0-1 level, which is in line with the toxicity standard of biomedical materials. No obvious inflammatory reaction was found in the tissue section, showing good tissue-biocompatibility. CSNPs could transfer the plasmids or siRNA to cells with high loading rate. However, CSNPs might have much higher transfecting efficiency for siRNA than plasmids, which implied that CSNPs might be more suitable for being a safe and efficient vector for delivering siRNA than plasmids.The results of flow cytometry showed that the transfection rate was higher than that of commercial transfection reagents. Results also showed that CSNPs had good blood compatibility, so it can be applied as a safe and efficient siRNA delivery vector in cancer therapies. © 2017, Chongqing Functional Materials Periodical Press Co.

HDP suppressed the proliferation of Hep2 human larynx squamous carcinoma cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis revealed that exposure to HDP (400 μg/ml) caused a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Moreover, treatment with HDP for 24 h induced a significant apoptosis of Hep2 cells, which was accompanied by increased cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 and reduced expression of Bcl-2 protein. Additionally, HDP inhibited cell migration and suppressed the expression of MMP-2 and μPA.

Since the 20th century tobacco smoking has had an enormous impact on morbidity and mortality in the adult population, and it remains the greatest single preventable health risk factor worldwide. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Poland, with lung cancer as the primary cause of cancer-related death in Polish men and women. Given these statistics, this manuscript aims to estimate tobacco-Attributable cancer mortality in Poland. Material and methods. Data on cancer mortality come from the WHO Mortality Statistics database. Data on smoking prevalence in Poland come from standardized surveys based on nationally representative samples. Data on relative risks come from the Cancer Prevention Study II. Tobacco-Attributable fractions were calculated using standard methodology for calculating population-based attributable fractions. Results. In 2014, there were over 24 thousand tobacco-Attributed cancer deaths in men. Lung cancer tops the list of ranked cancer types, with a tobacco-Attributable fraction of 93%. Next is laryngeal (TAF = 90%), oropharyngeal (TAF = 86%) and esophageal (TAF = 80%) cancer. Overall, two-Thirds of the considered cancer deaths were attributed to tobacco smoke (TAF = 75%). In 2014, there were over 7.5 thousand of cancer deaths related to smoking in women. Here, both laryngeal and lung cancer (both TAF = 76%) top the ranked list. Next are esophageal (TAF = 61%) and oropharyngeal (TAF = 51%) cancers, and when combined almost half of all considered cancer deaths were attributed to tobacco smoke (TAF = 44%). Conclusions. Tobacco smoking and tobacco-Attributable cancer mortality remain one of the greatest health burdens in Poles. Each year over 30 thousand Polish men and women die of cancer caused by smoking. All these deaths could be avoided.","Cancer; Cancer mortality; Direct estimation method; PAF; TAF; Time trends; Tobacco-Attributable fraction; Tobacco-related cancer",Article,Scopus

The aim of the present study was to look for associations between the allelic variants in the POLE and POLD1 genes and colorectal cancer. One thousand, seven hundred and forty-nine DNA samples from colorectal cancer patients were collected from 2002 to 2013. Samples were divided in three groups: hereditary colorectal cancer patients, patients with different hereditary cancer syndromes in their families and patients with no cancer history in their families. The DNA samples were screened for allelic variants of POLE rs483352909 and POLD1 rs39751463 using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). All patients were negative for allelic variants rs483352909 of the POLE gene and rs397514632 of the POLD1 gene. One allelic variant rs373243003 in the POLE gene and one novel duplication of four nucleotides at the excision site between intron and exon (c.1384-5dupCCTA) in the POLD1 gene, was found. We could not detect or confirm the connection between the genetic variants in the POLD1 and POLE genes and colorectal cancer patients, but we detected a novel genetic variant with an unknown significance. © 2017 Pätzold LA, Berziņa D, Daneberga Z, Gardovskis J, Miklaševičs E.","Colorectal cancer; denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC); POLD1 gene; POLE gene",Article,Scopus

Therefore, detection and analysis of CTCs can play an important role in the diagnosis and decision-making of adjuvant treatment that aims to prevent metastasis. At present, patients' selection of treatment is based on the statistical risk of recurrence of metastatic disease, without considering whether the tumor cells have spread from the primary tumor. This may lead to unnecessary treatment of non-metastatic disease patients.

However, the effects of Danshen on human oral cancer cells remain relatively unknown. This study investigated the antiproliferative effects of a Danshen extract on human oral cancer SAS, SCC25, OEC-M1, and KB drug-resistant cell lines and elucidated the possible underlying mechanism. Methods: We investigated the anticancer potential of the Danshen extract in human oral cancer cell lines and an in vivo oral cancer xenograft mouse model. The expression of apoptosis-related molecules was evaluated through Western blotting, and the concentration of in vivo apoptotic markers was measured using immunohistochemical staining. The antitumor effects of 5-fluorouracil and the Danshen extract were compared. Results: Cell proliferation assays revealed that the Danshen extract strongly inhibited oral cancer cell proliferation. Cell morphology studies revealed that the Danshen extract inhibited the growth of SAS, SCC25, and OEC-M1 cells by inducing apoptosis. The Flow cytometric analysis indicated that the Danshen extract induced cell cycle G0/G1 arrest. Immunoblotting analysis for the expression of active caspase-3 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein indicated that Danshen extract-induced apoptosis in human oral cancer SAS cells was mediated through the caspase pathway. Moreover, the Danshen extract significantly inhibited growth in the SAS xenograft mouse model. Furthermore, the Danshen extract circumvented drug resistance in KB drug-resistant oral cancer cells.

Methods: Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we identified 3373 patients with stage IIIA pathological N2 status (pN2) NSCLC who underwent a lobectomy or pneumonectomy from 2004 to 2013. OS and LCSS were compared among patients coded as receiving PORT or observation. The proportional hazards model was applied for investigation. Results: OS and LCSS favored PORT for patients with stage IIIA (pN2) NSCLC. Multivariable analyses showed that PORT and the exact number of positive LNs (n≤3) were independently associated with better OS and LCSS. Both better OS and LCSS emerged for positive LNs (n>3) after the use of PORT in survival analyses, whereas the benefits of OS and LCSS were not observed anymore for positive LNs (n≤3) group. More importantly, multivariable analyses showed that the use of PORT is an independent risk factor of survival for positive LNs (n>3) but not for positive LNs (n≤3). Conclusions: In Stage IIIA (pN2) NSCLC, the use of PORT demonstrated better survival results than no PORT for patients with positive LNs (n>3), but not for patients with positive LNs (n≤3). © 2017 The Author(s).","Lymph nodes (LNs); Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); Postoperative radiotherapy (PORT)",Article,Scopus

Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has been clinically used in colorectal cancer imaging including preoperative staging, evaluation of therapeutic response, detection of disease recurrence, and investigation of unexplained rising tumor markers. Case presentation: We report a case of resected colorectal cancer presented with rising CEA levels in 5 years, and FDG-PET revealed no definitive evidence of recurrence except abnormal focal FDG uptake in the right thyroid lobe. However, fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the thyroid nodule showed negative for malignancy. Progressively rising CEA levels were noted over the following 5 years, but serial follow-up examinations did not find evidence of recurrence. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) was performed subsequently and again showed focal FDG uptake in the right thyroid lobe. This time, FNAC revealed positive for malignancy, in favor of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). The patient underwent total thyroidectomy and modified radical neck dissection, and MTC with cervical nodal metastasis (pT3N1) was diagnosed. He had cervical lymph nodes recurrence 2 years later, which was resected. Conclusions: This case reminded us that FDG-PET/CT may detect occult tumors resulting in CEA elevation other than colorectal cancer. Moreover, FNA has a higher false negative rate in detecting MTC than other forms of thyroid cancer. Repeat FNAC for the initial negative cytology result and measure of serum calcitonin for the early MTC detection could be more helpful to avoid the delay in MTC diagnosis. © 2017 The Author(s).","Calcitonin; Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA); Colorectal cancer; Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET); Medullary thyroid cancer",Article,Scopus

The results of the research carried out so far indicate that SLN biopsy, after a preoperative chemotherapy in patients at the N0 and N1-2 clinical stage is credible and in allows many of them to avoid the resection of axillary lymph nodes.

Fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitors are currently employed in clinical trials of different cancers. Regarding the essence and the importance of the personalized medicine, mainly mirrored by remarkable inter-individual variations in different populations, we aimed to perform a pilot study to address FGFR1 and FGFR3 expression levels and their correlation with the clinicopathological features in Iranian patients with bladder cancer (BC). Paired tumor and adjacent non tumor tissue samples along with their clinico-pathological parameters were obtained from 50 cases diagnosed with BC in different stages and grades. The mRNA expressions of FGFR1 and FGFR3 in tissue samples were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR). The expression levels of FGFR3 were significantly higher in tumor tissues when compared to adjacent normal tissues (p = 0.007), regardless of the stages and grades of the tumor. Over expression was associated with cigarette smoking (p = 0.037) and family history for cancer (p = 0.004). Decreased expression of FGFR1 was observed, remarkably evident in high-grade tumors (p = 0.047), while over expression was detected in low-grade samples. This pilot study clearly suggests that in Iranian BC patients FGFR1 and FGFR3 expression patterns are different, and also highly distinctive with regard to the tumor's stage and grade. Such particular expression patterns may indicate their special values to be employed for interventional studies aiming targeted therapy. Further studies with a larger sample size are needed to validate our results. © 2017 Ousati Ashtiani Z, Tavakkoly-Bazzaz J, Salami SA, Pourmand MR, Mansouri F, Mashahdi R, Pourmand G.","Bladder cancer (BC); FGFR signaling; FGFR1; FGFR3; Targeted therapy",Article,Scopus

The purposes of this study are to compare physicians’ and nurses’ knowledge and attitudes toward cancer pain management (CPM) and describe their perceived barriers to CPM at oncology units. A descriptive cross-sectional design was utilized to obtain data through self-report questionnaire. The total number of sample size was 207 participants (72 physicians and 135 nurses). Findings revealed that both physicians and nurses had fair knowledge and attitudes toward CPM. Physicians had significantly higher knowledge and better attitudes than nurses (62.3 vs. 51.5%, respectively). Physicians were knowledgeable about pharmacological pain management and opioid addiction but had negative attitudes toward pain assessment. Nurses’ knowledge was better in regard of CPM guidelines, while they had poor knowledge about pharmacological pain management and opioid addiction. Physicians and nurses perceived knowledge deficit, lack of pain assessment, opioid unavailability, and lack of psychological interventions as the most common barriers to CPM. It is recommended to integrate recent evidence-based guidelines about CPM in oncology units that aim to improve practice.

It is administered in both non-resectable and resectable patients, i.e. those in whose case it is possible to undertake surgical treatment without the use of chemotherapy. Sentinel node biopsy may only be performed in patients classified as cN0. Hence, the dilemma of whether sentinel node biopsy should be performed before or after preoperative chemotherapy applies only to those patients in whom there are no axillary lymph node metastases before the chemotherapy in question (cN0). Even though the question of whether to perform sentinel node biopsy before or after preoperative chemotherapy in cN0 patients still remains open, a number of indicators testifying to the quality of the results obtained, tend to point in favour of sentinel node biopsy performed prior to chemotherapy. When sentinel node biopsy is performed before induction chemotherapy, the node identification rate is higher (100% vs 95%), and the rate of false negative results is lower (7.4% vs 11.4%) than in the case of a post-chemotherapy biopsy.","Breast cancer; False negative rate; Neoadjuvant chemotherapy; Sentinel node biopsy",Conference Paper,Scopus

EMT is therefore becoming a potential target for anti-cancer drug discovery. Here, we showed that phoyunnanin E, a compound isolated from Dendrobium venustum, possesses anti-migration activity and addressed its mechanism of action. Methods: The cytotoxic and proliferative effects of phoyunnanin E on human non-small cell lung cancer-derived H460, H292, and A549 cells and human keratinocyte HaCaT cells were investigated by MTT assay. The effect of phoyunnanin E on EMT was evaluated by determining the colony formation and EMT markers. The migration and invasion of H460, H292, A549 and HaCaT cells was evaluated by wound healing assay and transwell invasion assay, respectively. EMT markers, integrins and migration-associated proteins were examined by western blot analysis. Results: Phoyunnanin E at the concentrations of 5 and 10 μM, which are non-toxic to H460, H292, A549 and HaCaT cells showed good potential to inhibit the migratory activity of three types of human lung cancer cells. The anti-migration effect of phoyunnanin E was shown to relate to the suppressed EMT phenotypes, including growth in anchorage-independent condition, cell motility, and EMT-specific protein markers (N-cadherin, vimentin, slug, and snail). In addition to EMT suppression, we found that phoyunnanin E treatment with 5 and 10 μM could decrease the cellular level of integrin αv and integrin β3, these integrins are frequently up-regulated in highly metastatic tumor cells. We further characterized the regulatory proteins in cell migration and found that the cells treated with phoyunnanin E exhibited a significantly lower level of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK) and phosphorylated ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase (p-AKT), and their downstream effectors (including Ras-related C3 botulinum (Rac-GTP); Cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42); and Ras homolog gene family, member A (Rho-GTP)) in comparison to those of the non-treated control. Conclusions: We have determined for the first time that phoyunnanin E could inhibit the motility of lung cancer cells via the suppression of EMT and metastasis-related integrins.

Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral anticoagulants in ambulatory people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy, but otherwise have no standard therapeutic or prophylactic indication for anticoagulation. Search methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search in February 2016 that included a major electronic search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid) and Embase (Ovid); handsearching of conference proceedings; checking of references of included studies; a search for ongoing studies; and using the 'related citation' feature in PubMed. As part of the living systematic review approach, we are running continual searches and will incorporate new evidence rapidly after it is identified. This update of the systematic review is based on the findings of a literature search conducted on 14 December 2017. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the benefits and harms of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) in ambulatory people with cancer. These participants are typically undergoing systemic anticancer therapy, possibly including chemotherapy, target therapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy, but otherwise have no standard therapeutic or prophylactic indication for anticoagulation. Data collection and analysis: Using a standardized form, we extracted data in duplicate on study design, participants, intervention outcomes of interest and risk of bias. Outcomes of interest included all-cause mortality, symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE), symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), major bleeding, minor bleeding and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach (GRADE Handbook). Main results: Of 8545 identified citations, including 7668 unique citations, 16 papers reporting on 7 RCTs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. These trials enrolled 1486 participants. The oral anticoagulant was warfarin in six of these RCTs and apixaban in the seventh RCT. The comparator was either placebo or no intervention. The meta-analysis of the studies comparing VKA to no VKA did not rule out a clinically significant increase or decrease in mortality at one year (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.03; risk difference (RD) 29 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 75 fewer to 17 more; moderate certainty evidence). One study assessed the effect of VKA on thrombotic outcomes. The study did not rule out a clinically significant increase or decrease in PE when comparing VKA to no VKA (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.58; RD 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 6 fewer to 98 more; very low certainty evidence), but found that VKA compared to no VKA likely decreases the incidence of DVT (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.42; RD 35 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 38 fewer to 16 more; low certainty evidence). VKA increased both major bleeding (RR 2.93, 95% CI 1.86 to 4.62; RD 107 more per 1000, 95% CI 48 more to 201 more; moderate certainty evidence) and minor bleeding (RR 3.14, 95% CI 1.85 to 5.32; RD 167 more per 1000, 95% CI 66 more to 337 more; moderate certainty evidence). The study assessing the effect of DOAC compared to no DOAC did not rule out a clinically significant increase or decrease in mortality at three months (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.56; RD 51 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 65 fewer to 104 more; low certainty evidence), PE (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.91; RD 28 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 33 fewer to 97 more; low certainty evidence), symptomatic DVT (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.32; RD 93 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 100 fewer to 32 more; low certainty evidence), major bleeding (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.91; RD 28 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 33 fewer to 97 more; low certainty evidence); and minor bleeding (RR 4.43, 95% CI 0.25 to 79.68; RD 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 0 fewer to 8 more; low certainty evidence).

Extrajimos los datos desde las revisiones identificadas, reanalizamos los datos de los estudios primarios y preparamos una tabla de resumen de los resultados utilizando el método GRADE.RESULTADOS Y CONCLUSIONES: Identificamos diez revisiones sistemáticas, que en conjunto incluyen tres estudios, entre ellos dos ensayos aleatorizados. Concluimos que no está claro si los cannabinoides logran o no un aumento de peso en pacientes con anorexia-caquexia porque la certeza de la evidencia es muy baja, podrían no tener tampoco efecto sobre el apetito, y probablemente se asocian a efectos adversos frecuentes.",,Article,Scopus

Extraneural metastases are rarely reported in the literature. Case presentation: We report a case of a 38-year-old patient who was diagnosed with glioblastoma in 2015. Four months after surgery, local relapse was found and the patient received a second surgery. After another 4 months, we found a hard mass in the right posterior neck when she admitted to our department for fourth cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy. Immunohistochemical investigation supported the diagnosis of glioblastoma metastases to the neck after resection of the right neck mass. A few days later, spinal vertebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed multiple metastases in the thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and bilateral iliac bones. Conclusions: Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor. Whole tumor resection and early radiotherapy and chemotherapy can delay recurrence and prolong survival. Extracranial metastases are extremely rare.

This study characterizes the tumorigenesis of CD133+ cells and their sensitivity to pharmacological inhibition. Methods: GSCs from human U87 and rat C6 glioblastoma cell lines were isolated via magnetic cell sorting using CD133 as a cancer stem cell marker. Cell proliferation was determined using the WST-1 assay. An intracranial mouse model and bioluminescence imaging were used to assess the effects of drugs on tumor growth in vivo. Results: CD133+ cells expressed stem cell markers and exhibited self-renewal and enhanced tumor formation. Minocycline (Mino) was more effective in reducing the survival rate of CD133+ cells, whereas CD133+ cells were more sensitive to inhibition by the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) inhibitor. Inhibition of STAT3 decreased the expression of CD133+ stem cell markers. The combination of Mino and STAT3 inhibitor synergistically reduced the cell viability of glioma cells. Furthermore, this combination synergistically suppressed tumor growth in nude mice. Conclusion: The results suggest that concurrent targeting of different subpopulations of glioblastoma cells may be an effective therapeutic strategy for patients with malignant glioma. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cancer stem cells; Combination therapy; Glioma; Minocycline; STAT3; Synergy",Article,Scopus

BCBM are associated with dismal prognosis not at least due to lack of valuable molecular therapeutic targets. The aim of the study was to identify new molecular biomarkers and targets in BCBM by using complementary state-of-the-art techniques. Methods: We compared array expression profiles of three BCBM with 16 non-brain metastatic BC and 16 primary brain tumors (prBT) using a false discovery rate (FDR) p<0.05 and fold change (FC)>2. Biofunctional analysis was conducted on the differentially expressed probe sets. High-density arrays were employed to detect copy number variations (CNVs) and whole exome sequencing (WES) with paired-end reads of 150bp was utilized to detect gene mutations in the three BCBM. Results: The top 370 probe sets that were differentially expressed between BCBM and both BC and prBT were in the majority comparably overexpressed in BCBM and included, e.g. the coding genes BCL3, BNIP3, BNIP3P1, BRIP1, CASP14, CDC25A, DMBT1, IDH2, E2F1, MYCN, RAD51, RAD54L, and VDR. A number of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) were comparably overexpressed in BCBM and included SNORA1, SNORA2A, SNORA9, SNORA10, SNORA22, SNORA24, SNORA30, SNORA37, SNORA38, SNORA52, SNORA71A, SNORA71B, SNORA71C, SNORD13P2, SNORD15A, SNORD34, SNORD35A, SNORD41, SNORD53, and SCARNA22. The top canonical pathway was entitled, role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response. Network analysis revealed key nodes as Akt, ERK1/2, NFkB, and Ras in a predicted activation stage. Downregulated genes in a data set that was shared between BCBM and prBT comprised, e.g. BC cell line invasion markers JUN, MMP3, TFF1, and HAS2. Important cancer genes affected by CNVs included TP53, BRCA1, BRCA2, ERBB2, IDH1, and IDH2. WES detected numerous mutations, some of which affecting BC associated genes as CDH1, HEPACAM, and LOXHD1. Conclusions: Using complementary molecular genetic techniques, this study identified shared and unshared molecular events in three highly aberrant BCBM emphasizing the challenge to detect new molecular biomarkers and targets with translational implications. Among new findings with the capacity to gain clinical relevance is the detection of overexpressed snoRNAs known to regulate some critical cellular functions as ribosome biogenesis. © 2017 The Author(s).","Breast cancer brain metastases; Copy number variations; Pathway and network analysis; SnoRNAs; Whole exome sequencing; Whole transcript array profiling",Article,Scopus

The aim of this study was to investigate effects of photon and carbon ion irradiation in combination with inhibitors of DNA-Damage Response (DDR) on tumor cell radiosensitivity under hypoxic conditions. Methods: Human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) models, A549 and H1437, were irradiated with dose series of photon and carbon ions under hypoxia (1% O2) vs. normoxic conditions (21% O2). Clonogenic survival was studied after dual combinations of radiotherapy with inhibitors of DNA-dependent Protein Kinase (DNAPKi, M3814) and ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATMi). Results: The OER at 30% survival for photon irradiation of A549 cells was 1.4. The maximal oxygen effect measured as survival ratio was 2.34 at 8 Gy photon irradiation of A549 cells. In contrast, no significant oxygen effect was found after carbon ion irradiation. Accordingly, the relative effect of 6 Gy carbon ions was determined as 3.8 under normoxia and. 4.11 under hypoxia. ATM and DNA-PK inhibitors dose dependently sensitized tumor cells for both radiation qualities. For 100 nM DNAPKi the survival ratio at 4 Gy more than doubled from 1.59 under normoxia to 3.3 under hypoxia revealing a strong radiosensitizing effect under hypoxic conditions. In contrast, this ratio only moderately increased after photon irradiation and ATMi under hypoxia. The most effective treatment was combined carbon ion irradiation and DNA damage repair inhibition. Conclusions: Carbon ions efficiently eradicate hypoxic tumor cells. Both, ATMi and DNAPKi elicit radiosensitizing effects. DNAPKi preferentially sensitizes hypoxic cells to radiotherapy. © 2017 The Author(s).","ATM; Carbon ions; DNA-Pk; Hypoxia; Lung cancer; Radioresistance; Serine/threonine kinase inhibitors",Article,Scopus

OCT4, which is a homeobox transcription factor, has an important role in the self-renewal potential of cancer cells. Our aim here is to elucidate impact of ectopic expression of TWIST1 on OCT4 gene expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods: The ESCC line was KYSE30. GP293T cells were transfected with purf-IRES-GFP and pGP plasmids to produce recombinant viral particles. A semi-confluent KYSE30 culture was transduced with the prepared retroviral particles. mRNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed from normal KYSE30 cells and those ectopically expressing TWIST1. Expressional analysis of TWIST1 and OCT4 were performed with relative comparative real-time PCR. Results: Ectopic expression of TWIST1 in KYSE30 cells was related to its significant overexpression: nearly nine-fold higher in GFP-hTWIST1 KYSE-30 cells than in control GFP cells. This induced expression of TWIST1 caused significant upregulation of OCT4 in GFP-hTWIST1 KYSE-30 cells: nearly eight-fold higher. In silico analysis predicted the correlation of TWIST1 and OCT4 through ETS2. Conclusions: Overexpressed TWIST1 can be correlated with upregulation of the cancer stem cell marker OCT4 and the protein may play critical regulatory role in OCT4 gene expression. Since OCT4 is involved in the self-renewal process, the results may suggest a new linkage between TWIST1 and OCT4 in the cell biology of ESCC, highlighting the probable role of TWIST1 in inducing self-renewal. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cancer stem cells (CSCs); Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC); OCT4; TWIST1",Article,Scopus

Methods: Twenty-seven patients with histopathologically proven invasive ductal breast cancer were selected in preliminary study. Tumors were classified into molecular subtypes: luminal A (ER-positive and/or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) -negative, proliferation marker Ki-67<20 and low grade (I)) and luminal B (ER-positive and/or PR-positive, HER2-positive or HER2-negative with high Ki-67≥20 and higher grade (II or III)). Co-occurrence matrix -based texture features were extracted from each tumor on T1-weighted non fat saturated pre- and postcontrast MR images using TA software MaZda. Texture parameters and tumour volumes were correlated with tumour prognostic factors. Results: Textural differences were observed mainly in precontrast images. The two most discriminative texture parameters to differentiate luminal A and luminal B subtypes were sum entropy and sum variance (p=0.003). The AUCs were 0.828 for sum entropy (p=0.004), and 0.833 for sum variance (p=0.003), and 0.878 for the model combining texture features sum entropy, sum variance (p=0.001). In the LOOCV, the AUC for model combining features sum entropy and sum variance was 0.876. Sum entropy and sum variance showed positive correlation with higher Ki-67 index. Luminal B types were larger in volume and moderate correlation between larger tumour volume and higher Ki-67 index was also observed (r=0.499, p=0.008). Conclusions: Texture features which measure randomness, heterogeneity or smoothness and homogeneity may either directly or indirectly reflect underlying growth patterns of breast tumours. TA and volumetric analysis may provide a way to evaluate the biologic aggressiveness of breast tumours and provide aid in decisions regarding therapeutic efficacy. © 2017 The Author(s).","Breast cancer; Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC); Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Prognostic factors; Texture analysis (TA); Volumetric analysis",Article,Scopus

Changes in the nucleoli cytomorphology were one of the first histopathological characteristics of malignant tumors. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the cytomorphological characteristics of nucleoli and detailed clinicopathological parameters of melanoma patients. Moreover, we analyzed the correlation between cytomorphological parameters of nucleoli and immunoreactivity of selected proteins responsible for, among others, regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (SPARC, N-cadherin), cell adhesion and motility (ALCAM, ADAM-10), mitotic divisions (PLK1), cellular survival (FOXP1) and the functioning of Golgi apparatus (GOLPH3, GP73). Methods: Three characteristics of nucleoli - presence, size and number - of cancer cells were assessed in H&E-stained slides of 96 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary cutaneous melanoma tissue specimens. The results were correlated with classical clinicopathological features and patient survival. Immunohistochemical analysis of the above mentioned proteins was described in details in previous studies. Results: Higher prevalence and size of nucleoli were associated with thicker and mitogenic tumors. All three nucleolar characteristics were related to the presence of ulceration. Moreover, microsatellitosis was strongly correlated with the presence of macronucleoli and polynucleolization (presence of two or more nucleoli). Lack of immunologic response manifested as no TILs in primary tumor was associated with high prevalence of melanoma cells with distinct nucleoli. Interestingly, in nodular melanoma a higher percentage of melanoma cells with prominent nucleoli was observed. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, increased prevalence and amount, but not size of nucleoli, were connected with shorter cancer-specific and disease-free survival. Conclusion: (1) High representation of cancer cells with distinct nucleoli, greater size and number of nucleoli per cell are characteristics of aggressive phenotype of melanoma; (2) higher prevalence and size of nucleoli are potential measures of cell kinetics that are strictly correlated with high mitotic rate; and (3) high prevalence of cancer cells with distinct nucleoli and presence of melanocytes with multiple nucleoli are features associated with unfavorable prognosis in patients with cutaneous melanoma. © 2017 The Author(s).","Melanoma; Nucleolus; Prognosis",Article,Scopus

This transcript, named hTERT antisense promoter-associated (hTAPAS) RNA, is a 1.6 kb long non-coding RNA. hTAPAS transcription is initiated 167 nucleotides upstream of the hTERT transcription start site and is present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, we observed that a large fraction of the hTERT polyadenylated RNA is localized in the nucleus, suggesting this might be an additional means of regulating the cellular abundance of hTERT protein. Both hTAPAS and hTERT are expressed in immortalized B-cells and human embryonic stem cells but are not detected in normal somatic cells. hTAPAS expression inversely correlates with hTERT expression in different types of cancer samples. Moreover, hTAPAS expression is not promoted by an hTERT promoter mutation (-124 C > T). Antisense-oligonucleotide mediated knockdown of hTAPAS results in an increase in hTERT expression. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of hTAPAS down regulates hTERT expression, suggesting a negative role in hTERT gene regulation. These observations provide insights into hTAPAS as a novel player that negatively regulates hTERT expression and may be involved in telomere length homeostasis. © 2016 by the authors.","Bidirectional transcription; Cancer; LncRNA; TERT",Article,Scopus

They are classically associated with seizures and behavioral disturbance, and may coexist with other autoantibodies. Many are paraneoplastic, most commonly associated with small cell lung cancer. Until now there have been no reports of cardiac dysrhythmias in these patients. Case presentation: A 65-year-old Caucasian man presented with multiple seizures, dysarthria and behavioral disturbance of unclear etiology, with associated asystolic cardiac arrest. Antibody testing showed anti-Gamma-aminobutyric acid-B receptor and anti-Hu antibodies in serum and Gamma-aminobutyric acid-B receptor autoantibodies in cerebrospinal fluid. The diagnosis of small cell lung cancer was subsequently made after lung biopsy, and the patient showed improvement with chemotherapy and intravenous immunoglobulin. Conclusions: We present the case of a patient with Gamma-aminobutyric acid-B receptor limbic encephalitis associated with asystolic cardiac arrest, an association not previously described. This case illustrates how difficult it is to make the diagnosis on clinical grounds alone. We therefore propose more routine antibody testing in patients with similar symptomatology who remain undifferentiated after initial workup. We also recommend that in the acute setting, patients with Gamma-aminobutyric acid-B receptor encephalitis should receive cardiac monitoring, as further research is required to clarify its possible link with cardiac dysrhythmias. © 2017 The Author(s).","Anti-Hu; Asystole; Autoimmune; Cardiac arrest; Cardiac dysrhythmias; GABAB receptor; Limbic encephalitis; Paraneoplastic",Article,Scopus

Based on numerous epidemiological and microbiological studies, Helicobacter pylori is believed to be responsible for the progression of gastric MALT lymphomas (GML). Lymphoid tissue is physiologically absent from the stomach. However, GML can arise from chronic H. pylori infection and immune cell infiltration. This review article describes the mechanisms favouring the development of H. pylori-induced GML, and suggests potential targets for a more effective remission of lymphomas localized within the stomach.","Helicobacter pylori; Immunosuppression; Malt lymphoma; Proliferation; Stomach",Review,Scopus

Gold nanoparticles can absorb a large amount of radiation according to their geometry, such as nanospheres and nanorods. The importance of gold nanoparticles geometry is based on the electromagnetic spectrum wavelength where exists a greater absorption of radiation, which belongs to the visible region for nanospheres and ranges between visible and near infrared regions for nanorods, conferring greater biomedical applicability to the latter. When using photochemical synthesis method, which consists of reducing gold atoms to their metallic state with UV radiation, the geometry of gold nanoparticles depends on different variables such as: 1) pH, 2) concentration of chloroauric acid, 3) the surfactant, 4) concentration of silver nitrate, 5) temperature and 6) irradiation time. Therefore, in this study the geometry of the gold nanoparticles obtained by photochemical synthesis was determined as a function of solution pH and chloroauric acid concentration, using Spectrophotometry in the Ultraviolet Visible region (UV-vis) as characterization technique. From the analysis of the UV-vis spectra, it was determined that at an acidic pH the particles have two absorption bands corresponding to nanorods geometry, while at a basic pH only nanospheres are found and at a neutral pH the lower relative intensity of the second band indicates the simultaneous existence of the two geometries. The increase in the concentration of chloroauric acid produces a decrease in the amount of synthesized nanorods, seen as a decrease of the relative intensity of the second absorption band. Therefore, obtaining gold nanoparticles with nanorods geometry favours fields such as biomedicine, because they are capable of absorbing infrared radiation and can be used as photosensitive agents in localized thermal therapy against cancer. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Conference Paper,Scopus

Many fungi produce toxins, organic acids, antibiotics and other secondary metabolites, and are sources of useful biocatalysts such as cellulases, xylanases, proteases and pectinases, to mention a few. They can also cause diseases in animals as well as plants and many are able to break down complex organic molecules such as lignin and pollutants like xenobiotics, petroleum and polycyclic aromatic compounds. Current research on mushrooms focuses on their hypoglycemic, anti-cancer, anti-pathogenic and immunity-enhancing activities.

This gives a very broad spectrum of nanotube applications, such as in combination with polymers as polymer composites in the automotive, aerospace or textile industries. At present, many methods of nanotube synthesis are known [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

The phylogenetic highly conserved protein Galectin 3 (Gal3) contributes to cell differentiation and immune homeostasis. There is evidence that Gal3 is involved in the progression of oscc and influences the regulation of macrophage polarization. Macrophage polarization (M1 vs. M2) in solid malignancies like oscc contributes to tumor immune-escape. However, the relationship between macrophage polarization and Gal3 expression in oscc is not yet understood. The current study analyzes the association between histomorphologic parameters (T-, N-, L- Pn-status, grading) and Gal3 expression resp. the ratio between Gal3 expressing cells and CD68 positive macrophages in oscc specimens. Methods: Preoperative diagnostic biopsies (n = 26) and tumor resection specimens (n = 34) of T1/T2 oscc patients were immunohistochemically analyzed for Gal3 and CD68 expression. The number of Gal3 expressing cells and the ratio between CD68 and Gal3 expressing cells was quantitatively assessed. Results: In biopsy and tumor resection specimens, the number of Gal3 positive cells as well as the Gal3/CD68 ratio were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in T2 oscc compared to T1 cases. In biopsy specimens, a significantly (p < 0.05) increased Gal3 expression and Gal3/CD68 ratio was associated with the progression marker lymph vessel infiltration (L1). Tumor resection specimens of cases with lymph node metastases (N+) had a significantly (p < 0.05) increased Gal3 expression. Additionally, a high Gal3/CD68 ratio correlated significantly (p < 0.05) with higher grading (G3) in tumor resection specimens. Conclusion: High Gal3 expression in oscc is associated with tumor size (T-status) and parameters of malignancy (N-, L-status, grading). Gal3 might contribute to M2 macrophage mediated local immune tolerance. Gal3 expression shows association with prognosis in oscc and represent a potential therapeutic target. © 2017 The Author(s).","Gal3; Galectin 3; M1; M2; Macrophage polarization; Oral cancer; Oral squamous cell carcinoma; Oscc",Article,Scopus

Although the exact pathophysiology is unknown, autoimmune retinopathy occurs when a tumor expresses protein antigens that are normally present in the retina. This results in molecular mimicry and immunologic cross reactivity leading to retinal degeneration. AlR typically presents with progressive bilateral or asymmetric, painless, vision loss occurring over days to years. Visual symptoms are usually worse than the clinical findings and include photo aversion, prolonged glare after light exposure, decreased visual acuity, dyschromatopsia, central scotomas, nyctalopia, shimmering lights, photopsias, prolonged dark adaptation, midperipheral (ring) scotomas, and more extensive peripheral visual field defects. Although the initial retinal examination is often unremarkable, clinical findings may include subtle retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) changes to marked RPE bone spicules, arterial sheathing or attenuation, periphlebitis, disc pallor, and rarely low-grade inflammation in the vitreous and/or anterior chamber. The diagnosis can be made using a combination of the patient's history, clinical exam, and a multitude of diagnostic tests including spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), electrophysiology, fundus autofluorescence, visual field testing, and serology for antiretinal antibodies. All patients suspected of having AIR require a thorough work-up for malignancy.

Here, we further explored the mechanism of MEG3 inactivation in retinoblastoma. Methods: MSP and qRT-PCR were performed to detect the methylation status of MEG3 promoter and levels of MEG3 expression, respective. To further explore relationship between MEG3 expression and epigenetic modifications, 5-Aza-CdR was used to interfere with DNA methylation. In addition, we evaluated proliferation, apoptosis and the expression of β-catenin via CCK-8, flow cytometric analysis and western blot analysis, respective. Results: Hypermethylation of MEG3 promoter was observed more frequently in retinoblastoma tissues and was highly associated with low MEG3 expression and poor survival of retinoblastoma patients. We also provided evidence demonstrating that hypermethylation of MEG3 promoter depressed MEG3 expression, promoted proliferation, inhibited apoptosis and increased β-catenin expression of retinoblastoma cells in vitro.

This long treatment leads to significant compliance problems and consequently to recrudescence of the disease and to the development of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. Thus, new alternatives are needed to shorten or simplify the treatment of TB. Antibodies have therapeutic effects in animal models of TB, so their use as adjuvants in drug-sensitive and MDR TB is an interesting alternative. To assess the effect of antibodies, BALB/c mice with active late disease 60 days after infection with drug-sensitive TB strain H37Rv were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy. When compared with control non-treated animals, IVIg alone produced a significantly decreased burden of pulmonary bacilli. This decrease was even greater when IVIg was used in combination with conventional chemotherapy. The combined therapy also significantly reduced tissue damage (pneumonia) when compared to infected animals treated only with antibiotics. IVIg treatment also caused decreased bacillary burdens in mice infected with an MDR strain. In vitro experiments suggested that improving phagocytosis by efficient opsonization is perhaps the principal mechanism of this beneficial therapeutic effect. © FEMS 2017. All rights reserved.

Right renal cell carcinoma was found, and amyloid A amyloidosis was diagnosed concomitantly based on colon biopsy. The renal cell carcinoma was resected, and the non-cancerous part of the renal tissue also showed amyloid A deposition. Following surgery, protein levels in the urine increased to the nephrotic range, and administration of tocilizumab was initiated, which resulted in resolution of the proteinuria.

Methods: A systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature on menthol cigarettes via a PubMed search through May 9, 2017. The National Cancer Institute's Bibliography of Literature on Menthol and Tobacco and the FDA's 2011 report and 2013 addendum were reviewed for additional publications.

Results: Eighty-two studies on menthol cigarette initiation (n = 46), dependence (n = 14), and cessation (n = 34) were included. Large, representative studies show an association between menthol and youth smoking that is consistent in magnitude and direction. One longitudinal and eight cross-sectional studies demonstrate that menthol smokers report increased nicotine dependence compared to non-menthol smokers. Ten studies support the temporal relationship between menthol and reduced smoking cessation, as they measure cessation success at follow-up. Conclusions: The strength and consistency of the associations in these studies support that the removal of menthol from cigarettes is likely to reduce youth smoking initiation, improve smoking cessation outcomes in adult smokers, and in turn, benefit public health. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cessation; Dependence; Policy; Public health; Youth tobacco use",Review,Scopus

As natural phytochemicals, phenolic compounds (PCs) are a major class of semi-water-soluble compounds (from fruit and vegetable sources) with one or more benzene rings that are generally found in nature as glycosides. According to a review of the literature, food scientists have studied the many health benefits of these compounds against pernicious human diseases (HDs). Today, choosing a healthy diet has become an essential part of healthy living and fitness. Many studies have shown that people who follow a specific diet (especially polyphenol-rich diets) are at a low risk for a range of chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, etc. The present research is a comprehensive review of studies on PCs with a focus on HDs that seeks to find out why some PCs have received such considerable attention all over the world. Data were collected from the Scopus database and a hierarchical cluster analysis was used with Ward’s method to analyze the data. The results showed that three countries most involved in research on PCs are USA, China, and India, and also found that quercetin, catechin, and kaempferol are the three most studied PCs. Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, obesity, diabetes, and infectious diseases are the major treatment targets for PCs. The review of the literature showed that these compounds share a common molecular mode of action against HDs.

This research is intended to isolate and to identify the antiradical compounds from the bark of Jujube tree (Zizyphus mauritiana Auct. non Lamk.). The methanol extract of the bark was successively fractionated with n-hexane and ethyl acetate to give n-hexane fraction, ethyl acetate fraction, and methanol extract residue, respectively. The extract and fractions were examined for its radical scavenging activity using 2,2’-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazil radical. The ethyl acetate fraction, having the most active 2,2’-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazil radical scavenging, was further repeatedly separated using vacuum liquid chromatography, and the purification was carried out using preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC) in order to obtain an active isolate. The purity of the isolate was evaluated using thin layer chromatography method and melting point measurement. The structure of the isolate was identified chemically using various spray reagent and ultraviolet-visible, infrared, infrared, Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) and Proton Magnetic Resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopic methods. The extract, fraction, and sub-fractions were determined for its total contents of phenolic and flavonoid. The results showed that the methanol extract residue contained the highest total phenolic (36.29% wt/wt gallic acid equivalent), while fraction E4 of the ethyl acetate extract contained the highest total flavonoids (21.31% wt/wt quercetin equivalent). The active isolate showed to have 2,2’-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazil radical scavenging activity with IC50 of 7.58 μ/mL and is identified as trans-p-coumaroyl triterpene. Detail structure of the triterpene needs to be identified further. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Antioxidant; Flavonoid content; Isolation; Jujube tree; Total phenolic",Article,Scopus

This secondary data analysis is aimed to detect whether there are potential biases caused by difference of confounding factor adjustment strategies in case-control study, and whether such bias would impact the summary effect size of meta-analysis. Methods: We included all meta-analyses that focused on the association between breast cancer and passive smoking among non-smoking women, as well as each original case-control studies included in these meta-analyses. The relative deviations (RDs) of each original study were calculated to detect how magnitude the adjustment would impact the estimation of ORs, compared with crude ORs. At the same time, a scatter diagram was sketched to describe the distribution of adjusted ORs with different number of adjusted confounders. Results: Substantial inconsistency existed in meta-analysis of case-control studies, which would influence the precision of the summary effect size. First, mixed unadjusted and adjusted ORs were used to combine individual OR in majority of meta-analysis. Second, original studies with different adjustment strategies of confounders were combined, i.e. the number of adjusted confounders and different factors being adjusted in each original study. Third, adjustment did not make the effect size of original studies trend to constringency, which suggested that model fitting might have failed to correct the systematic error caused by confounding. Conclusions: The heterogeneity of confounder adjustment strategies in case-control studies may lead to further bias for summary effect size in meta-analyses, especially for weak or medium associations so that the direction of causal inference would be even reversed. Therefore, further methodological researches are needed, referring to the assessment of confounder adjustment strategies, as well as how to take this kind of bias into consideration when drawing conclusion based on summary estimation of meta-analyses. © 2017 The Author(s).","Case-control study; Confounding bias; Meta-analysis; Statistic adjustment",Article,Scopus

We investigated the effects of a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, on the EMT in RPE cells. In addition, we assessed the influence of bortezomib on regulation of the NF-κB pathway during this process. Methods: After treatment with various concentrations of bortezomib, cell viability was analyzed with the water-soluble tetrazolium salt-8 assay, cell-cycle regulation was evaluated with flow cytometry, and cell migration was monitored with in vitro wound healing and Transwell migration assays. To induce fibroblastoid transformation, the RPE cells were treated with recombinant human transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 (10 ng/ml), and western blot and immunocytochemical analyses were performed to evaluate altered expression of EMT markers after treatment with bortezomib. To verify the effect of bortezomib on shrinkage by myofibroblastic transformation, a contraction assay of the RPE-collagen gel lattice was performed. Results: Treatment with bortezomib decreased RPE viability in a dose-dependent manner, and flow cytometry revealed that these effects were due to arrest of the G2/M phase cell-cycle. In the in vitro wound healing and Transwell migration assays, treatment with 20 nM bortezomib significantly impeded RPE migration. Treatment with bortezomib also significantly inhibited TGF-β1-induced transdifferentiation of the RPE cells. The effects on proliferation, migration, and the EMT were mediated by regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, bortezomib inhibited contraction of the RPE-collagen gel lattices. Conclusions: Bortezomib inhibits myofibroblastic transformation of RPE cells by downregulating NF-κB expression and prevents contraction of the RPE-collagen gel matrix. Thus, bortezomib represents a candidate putative therapeutic agent for management of retinal fibrotic diseases. © 2017 Molecular Vision.",,Article,Scopus

A Phase 3 clinical trial has demonstrated the effectiveness of continuous TTFields application in patients with glioblastoma during maintenance treatment with Temozolomide. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of combining TTFields with radiation treatment (RT) in glioma cells. We also examined the effect of TTFields transducer arrays on RT distribution in a phantom model and the impact on rat skin toxicity. Methods: The efficacy of TTFields application after induction of DNA damage by RT or bleomycin was tested in U-118 MG and LN-18 glioma cells. The alkaline comet assay was used to measure repair of DNA lesions. Repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) were assessed by analyzing γH2AX or Rad51 foci. DNA damage and repair signaled by the activation pattern of phospho-ATM (pS1981) and phospho-DNA-PKcs (pS2056) was evaluated by immunoblotting. The absorption of the RT energy by transducer arrays was measured by applying RT through arrays placed on a solid-state phantom. Skin toxicities were tested in rats irradiated daily through the arrays with 2Gy (total dose of 20Gy). Results: TTFields synergistically enhanced the efficacy of RT in glioma cells. Application of TTFields to irradiated cells impaired repair of irradiation- or chemically-induced DNA damage, possibly by blocking homologous recombination repair. Transducer arrays presence caused a minor reduction in RT intensity at 20 mm and 60 mm below the arrays, but led to a significant increase in RT dosage at the phantom surface jeopardizing the ""skin sparing effect"". Nevertheless, transducer arrays placed on the rat skin during RT did not lead to additional skin reactions. Conclusions: Administration of TTFields after RT increases glioma cells treatment efficacy possibly by inhibition of DNA damage repair. These preclinical results support the application of TTFields therapy immediately after RT as a viable regimen to enhance RT outcome. Phantom measurements and animal models imply that it may be possible to leave the transducer arrays in place during RT without increasing skin toxicities. © 2017 The Author(s).","DNA damage repair; Glioma; Radiation treatment; Radiosensitization; TTFields",Article,Scopus

We examined the amount of nutrients and their contribution to total nutrient intake from supplements and compared these data between cancer survivors and cancer-free individuals. We also identified factors associated with supplement use among cancer survivors. Methods: We identified 400 cancer survivors and 10,387 cancer-free individuals, aged ≥ 19 years, from the fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) V-1, 2 (2010, 2011). We calculated the amount of nutrients consumed from foods and supplements, the percent contributions of supplement nutrients to total nutrient intakes and cancer survivors' nutrient intakes relative to the Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and the Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs). We examined factors associated with supplement use among cancer survivors. Results: We found that 33.3% of cancer survivors and 22.1% of cancer-free individuals reported the use of dietary supplements. Compared to cancer-free individuals, cancer survivors had higher intakes of riboflavin, folate, and iron from foods (p < 0.05 for each), and higher intakes of calcium (p = 0.05) and vitamin C (p = 0.01) from foods and supplements. The similar pattern was observed for the percent contributions to total nutrient intake. Cancer survivors had higher proportion of participants below EARs than cancer-free individuals for thiamin and niacin (p < 0.05 for each). The proportions of cancer survivors below the EARs were 61.2% for calcium, 49.1% for riboflavin, and 43.5% for folate and the proportions of cancer survivors above the ULs were 3.3% for iron, and 2.3% for vitamin A. For female cancer survivors, education above an elementary school level, moderate physical activity, low vegetable intake, and high circulating vitamin D levels were associated with supplement use. For male cancer survivors, living in an urban area, no consumption of alcohol, and lower energy intake, were associated with supplement use. Conclusions: Korean cancer survivors have higher rate of dietary supplement use and higher contribution from supplements to total nutrient intake than cancer-free individuals.

We report on outcome of the first four biennial invitation rounds. Methods: Data on screening outcome were retrieved from the 2015 and 2016 national screening quality reports. We calculated coverage by examination; participation after invitation; detection-, interval cancer- and false-positive rates; cancer characteristics; sensitivity and specificity, for Denmark and for the five regions. Results: At the national level coverage by examination remained at 75-77%; lower in the Capital Region than in the rest of Denmrk. Detection rate was slightly below 1% at first screen, 0.6% at subsequent screens, and one region had some fluctuation over time. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) constituted 13-14% of screen-detected cancers. In subsequent rounds, 80% of screen-detected invasive cancers were node negative and 40% ≤10 mm. False-positive rate was around 2%; higher for North Denmark Region than for the rest of Denmark. Three out of 10 breast cancers in screened women were diagnosed as interval cancers. Conclusions: High coverage by examination and low interval cancer rate are required for screening to decrease breast cancer mortality. Two pioneer local screening programs starting in the 1990s were followed by a decrease in breast cancer mortality of 22-25%. Coverage by examination and interval cancer rate of the national program were on the favorable side of values from the pioneer programs. It appears that the implementation of a national screening program in Denmark has been successful, though regional variations need further evaluation to assure optimization of the program. © 2017 The Author(s).","Breast cancer; Ductal carcinoma in situ; Mammography; Screening",Article,Scopus

Current treatment for ovarian cancer entails surgery followed by combined chemotherapy with platinum and taxane, which are associated, particularly cisplatin, with severe side effects. While this treatment approach appears to be initially effective in a high number of patients, nearly 70% of them suffer a relapse within a few months after initial treatment. Therefore, more effective and better-tolerated treatment options are clearly needed. In recent years, several natural compounds (such as curcumin, epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), resveratrol, sulforaphane and Withaferin-A), characterized by long-term safety and negligible and/or inexistent side effects, have been proposed as possible adjuvants of traditional chemotherapy. Indeed, several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that phytocompounds can effectively inhibit tumor cell proliferation, stimulate autophagy, induce apoptosis, and specifically target ovarian cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are generally considered to be responsible for tumor recurrence in several types of cancer. Here we review current literature on the role of natural products in ovarian cancer chemoprevention, highlighting their effects particularly on the regulation of inflammation, autophagy, proliferation and apoptosis, chemotherapy resistance, and ovarian CSC growth. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Apoptosis; Autophagy; Chemotherapy resistance; Natural compounds; Ovarian cancer; Ovarian cancer stem-like cells",Short Survey,Scopus

Previously, we found that HECTD3 confers cancer cell resistance to apoptosis. However, the significance of HECTD3 expression in ovarian cancer and its regulatory mechanisms were unknown. Here, we found that HECTD3 depletion promotes carboplatin-induced apoptosis in both an ovarian cancer cell model and a xenograft mouse model. Moreover, high HECTD3 expression is significantly associated with poor platinum response and prognosis in ovarian cancer patients. We further demonstrated that HER2 can up-regulate HECTD3 expression through activating STAT3. Furthermore, HER2 inhibitors, such as lapatinib, down-regulate HECTD3 expression and thus promote the chemosensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to carboplatin. Lapatinib combined with carboplatin also significantly inhibits serous ovarian carcinoma growth compared with each drug alone in a xenograft mouse model. HECTD3 may be considered a promising molecular predictor of platinum chemosensitivity and prognosis for serous ovarian cancer. Through decreasing HECTD3, lapatinib possesses significantly increased anti-tumor activity when combined with carboplatin compared with each agent alone, which provides an optional therapeutic regimen for serous ovarian cancer. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","HECTD3; HER2; Ovarian cancer; Platinum-resistance; Prognostic biomarker",Article,Scopus

Recent studies have confirmed the pivotal role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in tumorigenesis and the progression of malignant tumors, including gastric cancer. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism by which lncRNA AK023391 contributes to gastric cancer. Methods: A lncRNA microarray was used to identify the differentially expressed lncRNA AK023391 in gastric cancer and adjacent normal tissues. In addition, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to investigate the association between AK023391 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of patients with gastric cancer. Subsequently, a series of in vitro assays and a xenograft tumor model were used to observe the functions of lncRNA AK023391 in gastric cancer cells. A cancer pathway microarray, bioinformatic analysis, western blotting, and immunochemistry were carried out to verify the regulation of AK023391 and its downstream PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Results: Expression of lncRNA AK023391 was significantly upregulated in gastric cancer samples and cell lines in comparison to adjacent normal tissues, and was positively correlated with poor survival in patients with gastric cancer. The multivariate Cox regression model revealed that AK023391 expression acted as an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with gastric cancer. Knockdown of AK023391 inhibited cell growth and invasion both in vitro and in vivo, and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in gastric cancer cells, whereas its overexpression reversed these effects. Mechanistically, PI3K/Akt signaling mediated the NF-κB, FOXO3a, and p53 pathways.

METHODS Clinical data of patients with lung cancer who underwent surgical treatment in the hospital between 2000 and 2013 was retrospectively collected. The sex,age of onset and pathology type distribution of the patients were analyzed statistically. RESULTS A total of 3 733 patients with lung cancer met the inclusion criteria.The number of lung cancer patients admitted for treatment in the 14 years showed an increasing trend (P=0.018). The proportion of male and female was 1.52:1,and the proportion of female patients showed an uptrend (P&lt;0.001). Age of onset was concentrated in two age groups as 60-74 group (45.69%) and 45-59 (42.13%) group. The first three pathology types were adenocarcinoma (63.41%),squamous cell carcinoma (24.48%) and small cell lung cancer (3.08%). Trend χ 2 test showed that with the increase of the year,the proportion of squamous cell carcinoma showed a downtrend while the proportion of adenocarcinoma showed an uptrend (all P&lt;0.001),the proportion of the male patient with squamous cell carcinoma showed uptrend (P=0.005) while the proportion of female patient with adenocarcinoma showed uptrend (P&lt;0.001). The pathology type distribution of male and female patients was different (P&lt;0.001). The majority of male patients were adenocarcinoma (49.73%) and squamous cell carcinoma (35.92%),and adenocarcinoma was 84.20% in female patients,and squamous carcinoma accountted for only 7.09%.Compared finding in the former 7 years and that in the latter 7 years,the constitution of pathology type in male patients did not change (P=0.115),whereas that in female patients changed (P&lt;0.001),the manifestation was the proportion of adenocarcinoma rose from 74.43% in the former 7 years to 85.90% in the latter 7 years while the proportion of squamous cell carcinoma decreased from 15.07% to 5.71%.

The identification of mutated driver pathway and cancer progression from these data is a challenging task because of the heterogeneity of interpatient. In addition, cancer progression at the pathway level has been proved to be more reasonable than at the gene level. In this paper, we introduce an integrated framework to identify mutated driver pathways and cancer progression (iMDPCP) at the pathway level from somatic mutation data. First, we use uncertainty coefficient to quantify mutual exclusivity on gene driver pathways and develop a computational framework to identify mutated driver pathways based on the adaptive discrete differential evolution algorithm. Then, we construct cancer progression model for driver pathways based on the Bayesian Network. Finally, we evaluate the performance of iMDPCP on real cancer somatic mutation datasets. The experimental results indicate that iMDPCP is more accurate than state-of-the-art methods according to the enrichment of KEGG pathways, and it also provides new insights on identifying cancer progression at the pathway level.

The clinical characteristics of different metastatic sites are different,and the prognosis is different. Subcutaneous soft tissue metastasis is a rare metastasis type of lung cancer. This study is to investigate the clinical features,pathological types and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer patients with subcutaneous soft tissue metastases. METHODS Data of patients with NSCLC were collected from the Peking University Cancer Hospital from September 2009 to June 2016,and then the patients with subcutaneous soft tissue metastasis were enrolled. It was a retrospective analysis of 45 cases of NSCLC patients with subcutaneous soft tissue metastases. The clinical and pathological features of those patients were summarized. According to the follow-up data,understand the treatment outcome and survival prognosis,and further analysis of prognostic factors. RESULTS The median age of non-small cell lung cancer patients with subcutaneous soft tissue metastases was 59 years. There were 30 males(66.7%) and 15 females(33.3%). Primary lung cancer and subcutaneous soft tissue metastases were found at the same time in 27 cases(60.0%),and there were 18 cases(40.0%) in which the metastases were found afterward. Only isolated soft tissue metastases were in 7 cases(15.6%),and 38 cases(84.4%) with other distant metastases,including 33 cases with bone metastases.Pathological types were: adenocarcinoma in 30 cases(66.7%),squamous cell carcinoma in 14 cases(31.1%),adeno-squamous cell carcinoma in 1 cases(2.2%). Of the 26 patients with EGFR gene testing,7 were EGFR mutations (26.9%) and 19 were EGFR wild-type(73.1%). The survival time of the 45 patients ranged from 0.5 months to 40 months,with a median OS of 4.0 months. Median survival time of non-small cell lung cancer patients with subcutaneous soft tissue metastases was 4.0 months by Kaplan-Meier calculation. The prognosis of patients with stable first-line treatment was better. CONCLUSIONS NSCLC patients with subcutaneous soft tissue metastases suggest poor prognosis.

These immune responses can be evaluated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which has frequently been verified clinically. On the other hand, residual cancer burden (RCB) evaluation has been shown to be a useful predictor of survival after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). In this study, RCB and TILs evaluations were combined to produce an indicator that we have termed ""RCB-TILs"", and its clinical application to NAC for breast cancer was verified by subtype-stratified analysis. Methods: A total of 177 patients with breast cancer were treated with NAC. The correlation between RCB and TILs evaluated according to the standard method, and prognosis, including the efficacy of NAC, was investigated retrospectively. The RCB and TILs evaluations were combined to create the ""RCB-TILs"". Patients who were RCB-positive and had high TILs were considered RCB-TILs-positive, and all other combinations were RCB-TILs-negative. Results: On multivariable analysis, being RCB-TILs-positive was an independent factor for recurrence after NAC in all patients (p < 0.001, hazard ratio = 0.048), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients (p = 0.018, hazard ratio = 0.041), HER2-positive breast cancer (HER2BC) patients (p = 0.036, hazard ratio = 0.134), and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (HRBC) patients (p = 0.002, hazard ratio = 0.081). Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that RCB-TILs is a significant predictor for breast cancer recurrence after NAC and may be a more sensitive indicator than TILs alone. © 2017 The Author(s).","Breast cancer; Neoadjuvant chemotherapy; Predictive marker; Residual cancer burden; Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes",Article,Scopus

Critical information on cancer may be hidden in its signaling pathways. However, even though a large amount of money has been spent on cancer research, some critical information on cancer-related signaling pathways still remains elusive. Hence, new works towards a complete understanding of cancer-related signaling pathways will greatly benefit the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. Results: We propose the node-weighted Steiner tree approach to identify important elements of cancer-related signaling pathways at the level of proteins. This new approach has advantages over previous approaches since it is fast in processing large protein-protein interaction networks. We apply this new approach to identify important elements of two well-known cancer-related signaling pathways: PI3K/Akt and MAPK. First, we generate a node-weighted protein-protein interaction network using protein and signaling pathway data. Second, we modify and use two preprocessing techniques and a state-of-the-art Steiner tree algorithm to identify a subnetwork in the generated network. Third, we propose two new metrics to select important elements from this subnetwork. On a commonly used personal computer, this new approach takes less than 2 s to identify the important elements of PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways in a large node-weighted protein-protein interaction network with 16,843 vertices and 1,736,922 edges. We further analyze and demonstrate the significance of these identified elements to cancer signal transduction by exploring previously reported experimental evidences. Conclusions: Our node-weighted Steiner tree approach is shown to be both fast and effective to identify important elements of cancer-related signaling pathways. Furthermore, it may provide new perspectives into the identification of signaling pathways for other human diseases. © 2017 The Author(s).","Big data; Bioinformatics; Data mining; Systems biology",Article,Scopus

Here we report that multiparous mice are less susceptible to ovarian cancer metastasis in an age-matched syngeneic murine allograft model.

The aim of our study was to investigate the association between polymorphisms in XRCC1 gene and pancreatic cancer risk. We conducted a search of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined as measures of the strength of association between polymorphisms of XRCC1 and pancreatic cancer risk. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias were evaluated. All analyses were undertaken using the STATA 13.0. A total of 10 studies were included in this systematic review. Five common functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in XRCC1 gene were found, including Arg399Gln G > A (rs25487), Arg194Trp C > T (rs1799782), Arg280His G > A (rs25489), c.1517G > C, c.1471G > A.

For the 2000–2010 period, Study 1 established that state resident neuroticism accounted for an additional 11.2 to 31.7% of the variance in total, male, and female cancer incidence. With the same analytic procedures, Study 2 provided evidence for convergent and discriminant validity. Neuroticism accounted for significant variance in the incidence of a majority of the top 25 invasive cancer sites between 2000 and 2010, and cancer as a cause of death in 2011. In contrast, neuroticism was not a significant positive predictor of overall health in 2011, all-cause mortality in 2011, the prevalence of diabetes, COPD, and kidney disease in 2011, or, death in 2011 from digestive, nervous system, endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases, as well as from mental and behavioral disorders and certain infectious and parasitic diseases. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature","Big five; Cancer incidence; Geographical psychology; Health status; Mortality; Neuroticism; Stress",Article in Press,Scopus

However, the molecular mechanism of this effect is unknown. Immunohistochemistry revealed that HINT2 expression is relatively low in pancreatic cancer tissues, compared to that in adjacent tissues (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, its expression was related to pathological grade and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0161 and 0.0108, respectively); in addition, down-regulation of HINT2 was found to be associated with relatively poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. Up-regulation of HINT2 was shown to trigger pancreatic cancer cell apoptosis, decrease mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), promote intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and elevate mitochondrial Ca 2+ levels. However, co-treatment of HINT2 overexpressing BxPC-3 cells with ruthenium red partially inhibited HINT2-induced apoptosis, which was associated with a reduction in ΔΨm and an increase in intracellular ROS and mitochondrial Ca 2+ . According to our results, mitochondrial calcium uptake1 and 2 (MICU1 and MICU2) were down-regulated and the essential MCU regulator (EMRE) was up-regulated in cells transduced with Adv-HINT2. Therefore, we deduced that HINT2 triggers apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells by regulating mitochondrial Ca 2+ influx through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). In addition, we found that HINT2 can sensitize BxPC-3 and L3.6pl cells to gemcitabine-induced apoptosis and that gemcitabine up-regulates HINT2 expression.

This was a facility-based cross-sectional study performed at Kenyatta National Hospital and Texas Cancer Centre in Nairobi, Kenya. The risk of malnutrition was assessed using the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST). Diagnoses of malnutrition and cachexia were done using the European Society of Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) and Fearon criteria, respectively. A total of 512 participants were assessed. Those at risk of malnutrition were 33·1 % (12·5 % at medium risk, 20·6 % at high risk). Prevalence of malnutrition was 13·4 %. The overall weight loss >5 % over 3 months was 18·2 % and low fat-free mass index was 43·1 %. Prevalence of cachexia was 14·1 % compared with 8·5 % obtained using the local criteria. Only 18·6 % participants had received any form of nutrition services. Age was a predictor of malnutrition and cachexia in addition to site of cancer for malnutrition and cigarette smoking for cachexia. The use of the MUST as a screening tool at the first point of care should be explored. The predictive value of current nutrition assessment tools, and the local diagnostic criteria for malnutrition and cachexia should be reassessed to inform the development of appropriate clinical guidelines and future capacity-building initiatives that will ensure the correct identification of patients at risk for timely care.

Chi-square test and Logistic multivariate regression analysis were carried out to identify relevant factors predictive of sentinel limph nodal status. A probability level (P<0.05) was considered statistically significant. RESULTS The group was consisted of 1 491 patients whose ages ranged from 19 to 84 years old with an average of (48.8±10.5) years in age. Totally 27.0%(403/1 491) positive sentinel lymph nodes were found in all patients,and the mean number of sentinel lymph node removed by the surgeon was 4.43±2.42.

Concurrent chemoradiotherapy has become standard treatment for locally advanced NSCLC. The objective of this study was to investigate whether there was dissimilarity of volumetric shrinkage rate(VSR) between primary tumor and regionally-metastasized lymph nodes of locally advanced NSCLC treated by concurrent chemoradiotherapy and to explore the influential factors. METHODS A retrospective review identified patients diagnosed with locally advanced NSCLC in Shandong Cancer Hospital between July 1,2014 and December 31,2016. Thirty-two patients who both underwent baseline 18 F-FDG PET-CT scan within 4 weeks before treatment and treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy were enrolled. All enrolled patients received at least 50 Gy units of radiation. The target lesions were delineated on each patient's PET and CT images (enhanced planning CT and follow-up CT) respectively. Parameters such as metabolism parameters were automatically calculated and output as a table by MIM software. VSR and overall response rate (ORR) was calculated from gross tumor volume (GTV) delineated on CT scans. Relationship between VSR or ORR and metabolism parameters were analyzed. RESULTS (1) The average VSR of primary tumor was significantly higher than the average VSR of regionally-metastasized lymph nodes (59.8% vs 34.14%,z=-2.619,P=0.009). SUV max-nd (maximum standard uptake value of regionally-metastasized lymph node) was the only significant influential factor to VSR in multivariate analysis (OR=1.445,95%CI:0.891-2.344). (2) ORR in primary tumor was 56.3% and in regionally-metastasized lymph nodes was 31.0%. ORR was much more significant in primary tumor (χ 2 =6.326,P=0.012). Similarly,SUV max was the only significant influential factor to all NSCLC lesions in multivariate analysis (OR=0.845,95%CI:0.761-0.939). CONCLUSIONS In locally advanced NSCLC with concurrent chemoradiotherapy,VSR in primary tumor was more pronounced than regionally-involved lymph nodes and pretreatment SUV max may be a predictive variable. Similarly,SUV max-nd was an effective prognostic factor for short-term-efficacy of locally-advanced NSCLC treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

Non-treated MGC-803 and MKN-45 cells were used as negative controls, and those treated with interleukin-6 (100 ng/mL) for 2 h were used as a positive control. After treatment, cell viability was detected by MTT assay. The expression of autophagy markers was detected by Western blot. The diameter of transplantable tumor in a subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor model was also measured. RESULTS The viability of both MGC-803 and MKN-45 cells declined significantly after treatment (P < 0.05). E804 increased the expression of LC3-B and Beclin-1, two markers of autophagy, in a dose-dependent manner.

CONCLUSION E804 can promote autophagy of gastric cancer cells to suppress their growth, at least partly by inhibiting the activation of Stat3. © The Author(s) 2017.","Autophagy; E804; Gastric cancer; Stat3",Article,Scopus

High treatment cost, partly owing to higher prices of anti-cancer drugs, presents a significant burden on patients and healthcare systems. The aim of the present study was to survey and compare retail prices of anti-cancer drugs between high, middle and low income countries in the South-East Asia, Western Pacific and Eastern Mediterranean regions. Methods: Cross-sectional survey design was used for the present study. Pricing data from ten counties including one from South-East Asia, two from Western Pacific and seven from Eastern Mediterranean regions were used in this study. Purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted mean unit prices for 26 anti-cancer drug presentations (similar pharmaceutical form, strength, and pack size) were used to compare prices of anti-cancer drugs across three regions. A structured form was used to extract relevant data. Data were entered and analysed using Microsoft Excel®. Results: Overall, Taiwan had the lowest mean unit prices while Oman had the highest prices. Six (23.1%) and nine (34.6%) drug presentations had a mean unit price below US$100 and between US$100 and US$500 respectively. Eight drug presentations (30.7%) had a mean unit price of more than US$1000 including cabazitaxel with a mean unit price of $17,304.9/vial. There was a direct relationship between income category of the countries and their mean unit price; low-income countries had lower mean unit prices. The average PPP-adjusted unit prices for countries based on their income level were as follows: low middle-income countries (LMICs): US$814.07; high middle income countries (HMICs): US$1150.63; and high income countries (HICs): US$1148.19. Conclusions: There is a great variation in pricing of anticancer drugs in selected countires and within their respective regions. These findings will allow policy makers to compare prices of anti-cancer agents with neighbouring countries and develop policies to ensure accessibility and affordability of anti-cancer drugs. © 2017 The Author(s).","Anti-cancer drugs; Eastern Mediterranean; Pricing; South-East Asia; Western Pacific",Article,Scopus

Whilst early stage disease is generally cured by surgery, advanced EC has a poor prognosis with limited treatment options. Altered energy metabolism is a hallmark of malignancy. Cancer cells drive tumour growth through aerobic glycolysis and must export lactate to maintain intracellular pH. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of the lactate/proton monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT4 and their chaperone CD147 in EC, with the ultimate aim of directing future drug development. Methods: MCT1, MCT4 and CD147 expression was examined using immunohistochemical analysis in 90 endometrial tumours and correlated with clinico-pathological characteristics and survival outcomes. Results: MCT1 and MCT4 expression was observed in the cytoplasm, the plasma membrane or both locations. CD147 was detected in the plasma membrane and associated with MCT1 (p = 0.003) but not with MCT4 (p = 0.207) expression. High MCT1 expression was associated with reduced overall survival (p = 0.029) and remained statistically significant after adjustment for survival covariates (p = 0.017). Conclusion: Our data suggest that MCT1 expression is an important marker of poor prognosis in EC. MCT1 inhibition may have potential as a treatment for advanced or recurrent EC. © 2017 The Author(s).","Endometrial cancer; Glycolysis; Hypoxia; Monocarboxylate transporters",Article,Scopus

This ensures the T cell response is supported by sufficient energy and substrates necessary for cell survival, growth and proliferation. Different metabolic programs are associated with differentiation into different cell subsets, effector function and development of long-lasting memory. This provides an opportunity to improve the T cell response through manipulation of metabolism, which is instrumental to ameliorate the current protocols for cancer immunotherapy. Using drugs and molecules targeting selective metabolic pathways it is now possible to generate T cells that can mount a durable and stable anti-tumor response. On the other hand, cancer cells can take advantage of the metabolic requirements of T cells to evade the immune response. In this brief review we discuss recent findings of T cell metabolism in quiescence and activation, how the tumor microenvironment can affect T cell metabolism, and how T cell metabolism can be manipulated to improve the T cell response to tumors. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Immuno-metabolism; Immunotherapy; T cells",Short Survey,Scopus

As a proof of application, we detected DAAs in saliva samples from patients with gastric cancer, and the test results exhibited excellent specificity. Our detection system has the following major advantages: (i) the detection is rapid, being completed in less than 1 hour; (ii) the limit of detection falls in the effective range of DAA concentrations of gastric cancer at an early stage, indicating that our method is potentially suitable for early diagnosis of gastric cancer; (iii) the non-invasive sampling manner provides an adaptable system for point-of-care testing (POCT); and (iv) the system does not require any massive instruments or expensive reagents, which enables POCT as well. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Article,Scopus

Inosine exhibits similar properties as guanosine. As a result, A-to-I editing has a great impact on edited RNAs, not only affecting the base pairing properties, but also altering codons after translation. A-to-I editing are known to mediate and diversify transcripts. However, the overall biological effect of ADARs are still largely unknown. Aberrant ADAR activity and editing dysregulation are present in a variety of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, glioblastoma and melanoma. ADAR-mediated A-to-I editing can influence uncontrolled nucleotide changes, resulting in susceptibility of cells to developmental defects and potential carcinogenicity. A deeper understanding of the biological function of ADARs may provide mechanistic insights in the development of new cancer therapy.

METHODS In this study, we included 125 individuals with GC diagnosis, 66 individuals with CRC diagnosis and 475 cancer-free individuals. All participants resided in the North region of Brazil and authorized the use of their samples. The 12 polymorphisms (in CASP8 , CYP2E1 , CYP19A1 , IL1A , IL4 , MDM2 , NFKB1 , PAR1 , TP53 , TYMS , UGT1A1 and XRCC1 genes) were genotyped in a single PCR for each individual, followed by fragment analysis. To avoid misinterpretation due to population substructure, we applied a previously developed set of 61 ancestry-informative markers that can also be genotyped by multiplex PCR. The statistical analyses were performed in Structure v.2.3.4, R environment and SPSS v.20. RESULTS After statistical analyses with the control of confounding factors, such as genetic ancestry, three markers (rs79071878 in IL4 , rs3730485 in MDM2 and rs28362491 in NFKB1 ) were positively associated with the development of GC. One of these markers (rs28362491) and the marker in the UGT1A1 gene (rs8175347) were positively associated with the development of CRC. Therefore, we investigated whether the joint presence of the deleterious alleles of each marker could affect the development of cancer and we obtained positive results in all analyses. Carriers of the combination of alleles RP1 + DEL (rs79071878 and rs28361491, respectively) are at 10-times greater risk of developing GC than carriers of other combinations. Similarly, carriers of the combination of DEL + RARE (rs283628 and rs8175347) are at about 12-times greater risk of developing CRC than carriers of other combinations. CONCLUSION These findings are important for the comprehension of gastric and CRC development, particularly in highly admixed populations, such as the Brazilian population. © The Author(s) 2017.

IMPC is an aggressive tumor with poor clinical outcome. In addition, this histological subtype usually expresses human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) which also correlates with a more aggressive tumor. In this work we studied the clinical significance of IMPC in HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant trastuzumab. We also analyzed mucin 4 (MUC4) expression as a novel biomarker to identify IMPC. Methods: We retrospectively studied 86 HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting. We explored the association of the IMPC component with clinicopathological parameters at diagnosis and its prognostic value. We compared MUC4 expression in IMPC with respect to other histological breast cancer subtypes by immunohistochemistry. Results: IMPC, either as a pure entity or associated with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), was present in 18.6% of HER2-positive cases. It was positively correlated with estrogen receptor expression and tumor size and inversely correlated with patient's age. Disease-free survival was significantly lower in patients with IMPC (hazard ratio = 2.6; 95%, confidence interval 1.1-6.1, P = 0.0340). MUC4, a glycoprotein associated with metastasis, was strongly expressed in all IMPC cases tested. IMPC appeared as the histological breast cancer subtype with the highest MUC4 expression compared to IDC, lobular and mucinous carcinoma. Conclusion: In HER2-positive breast cancer, the presence of IMPC should be carefully examined. As it is often not informed, because it is relatively difficult to identify or altogether overlooked, we propose MUC4 expression as a useful biomarker to highlight IMPC presence. Patients with MUC4-positive tumors with IMPC component should be more frequently monitored and/or receive additional therapies. © 2017 The Author(s).","HER2; Invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast (IMPC); Mucin 4 (MUC4); Trastuzumab",Article,Scopus

The current RENAISSANCE trial addresses the potential benefits of surgical intervention in gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer with limited metastases. Methods: This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, investigator-initiated phase III trial. Previously untreated patients with limited metastatic stage (retroperitoneal lymph node metastases only or a maximum of one incurable organ site that is potentially resectable or locally controllable with or without retroperitoneal lymph nodes) receive 4 cycles of FLOT chemotherapy alone or with trastuzumab if Her2+. Patients without disease progression after 4 cycles are randomized 1:1 to receive additional chemotherapy cycles or surgical resection of primary and metastases followed by subsequent chemotherapy. 271 patients are to be allocated to the trial, of which at least 176 patients will proceed to randomization. The primary endpoint is overall survival; main secondary endpoints are quality of life assessed by EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire, progression free survival and surgical morbidity and mortality. Recruitment has already started; currently (Feb 2017) 22 patients have been enrolled. Discussion: If the RENAISSANCE concept proves to be effective, this could potentially lead to a new standard of therapy. On the contrary, if the outcome is negative, patients with gastric or GEJ cancer and metastases will no longer be considered candidates for surgical intervention.

The NEMO-binding domain peptide (NBDP) of IKK was found to inhibit NF-κB activation and promote apoptosis in cancer cells. Studies have shown that constitutive NF-κB activation, one of the signature molecular alterations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), is a potential therapeutic target. However, preclinical and therapeutic evidence that supports direct targeting of IKK activation in therapy is lacking. The aim of this study was to determine whether the combination of NBDP and gemcitabine would sensitize pancreatic cancer to the gemcitabine. We confirmed that NBDP inhibited NF-κB activation and found that NBDP indeed promoted chemo-sensitivity to gemcitabine in PDAC. NBDP increased PARP and caspase 3 cleavage in the apoptosis pathway, increased apoptosis of PDAC cells, and suppressed PDAC cell growth in vitro. In addition, NBDP combined with gemcitabine significantly decreased levels of NF-κB activity and inhibited the growth of PDAC in vivo in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model. Mechanistic investigations showed that NBDP effectively competed with NEMO/IKKγ for binding to IKKs and thus inhibited IKK and NF-κB activation, down-regulated expression levels of Erk, and decreased PDAC cell growth. Taken together, our current data demonstrate that NBDP sensitizes human pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. NBDP is a potential adjuvant chemotherapeutic agent for treating pancreatic cancer. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Gemcitabine; IKKγ; NF-κB; Pancreatic cancer; Targeted therapy",Article,Scopus

Patients’ decisional conflict was measured before entering the visit and two weeks after. Results underlined that decisional conflict decreased in the follow-up. Furthermore, perceived self-efficacy partially predicts a decrease in decisional conflict thus representing a protective factor while buck-passing defensive decisional style partially predicts an increase in decisional conflict thus representing a risk factor.

Methods: The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Ovid databases were searched for eligible studies until March 2017. Operation time, blood loss, circumferential resection margin-positive rate, distal margin length, number of resected lymph nodes, diverting stoma rate, postoperative overall morbidity, anastomotic leakage, and hospital stay were the main short-term effect endpoints. We also examined disease-free survival, overall survival, local recurrence, and post-operational anal function as secondary outcomes to evaluate the mid-term effects of laparoscopic surgery. Results: Five studies involving 620 patients were included in the analyses. Compared with the open approach, the laparoscopic ISR had less blood loss (weighted mean difference [WMD] = - 214.65 ml, 95% CI [- 370.44, - 196.13], p < 0.01), less postoperative overall morbidity (OR = 0.58, 95% CI [0.40, 0.86], p < 0.01), and shorter duration of hospital stay (WMD = - 5.87 days, 95% CI [- 11.35, - 0.40], p < 0.05); however, the operation time was significantly longer in the laparoscopic group (WMD = 47.34 min, 95% CI [4.10, 90.58], p < 0.05). No other significant differences were observed. Conclusion: Laparoscopic ISR for low rectal cancer offers fewer complications and faster recovery, with similar operation quality and mid-term oncological results than the conventional approach. Although this technique is comparatively more complex than the conventional approach and requires practice, laparoscopic ISR shows great potential as a surgical option and deserves further clinical study. © 2017 The Author(s).","Intersphincteric resection; Laparoscopic; Meta-analysis; Rectal cancer",Review,Scopus

We previously developed a computational tool called Expitope for assessing cross-reactivity (CR) of antigens based on tissue-specific gene expression. However, transcript abundance only indirectly indicates protein expression. The recent availability of proteome-wide human protein abundance information now facilitates a more direct approach for CR prediction. Here we present a new version 2.0 of Expitope, which computes all naturally possible epitopes of a peptide sequence and the corresponding CR indices using both protein and transcript abundance levels weighted by a proposed hierarchy of importance of various human tissues. Results: We tested the tool in two case studies: The first study quantitatively assessed the potential CR of the epitopes used for cancer immunotherapy. The second study evaluated HLA-A*02:01-restricted epitopes obtained from the Immune Epitope Database for different disease groups and demonstrated for the first time that there is a high variation in the background CR depending on the disease state of the host: compared to a healthy individual the CR index is on average two-fold higher for the autoimmune state, and five-fold higher for the cancer state. Conclusions: The ability to predict potential side effects in normal tissues helps in the development and selection of safer antigens, enabling more successful immunotherapy of cancer and other diseases. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cancer; Cross-reactivity; Immunoinformatics; Immunotherapy; T cell epitope; Tumor antigen expression; Tumor immunology",Article,Scopus

All patients were never smokers and had confirmed lung cancer diagnosis. ETS exposure during childhood showed a negative association on the probability of EGRF mutation though not significant.

Substantial efforts had been made to identify significantly mutated genes (SMGs) in ECs and use them as biomarkers for the classification of histological subtypes and the prediction of clinical outcomes. However, the impact of non-significantly mutated genes (non-SMGs), which may also play important roles in the prognosis of EC patients, has not been extensively studied. Therefore, it is essential for the discovery of biomarkers in ECs to further investigate the non-SMGs that were highly associated with clinical outcomes. Results: For the 9681 non-SMGs reported by the mutation annotation pipeline, there were 1053, 1273 and 395 non-SMGs differentially expressed between the patient groups divided by the clinical endpoints of histological grade, histological type as well as the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage of ECs, respectively. In the gene set enrichment analysis, the cancer-related pathways, namely neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway and calcium signaling pathway, were significantly enriched with the differentially expressed non-SMGs for all the three endpoints. We further identified 23, 19 and 24 non-SMGs, which were highly associated with histological grade, histological type and FIGO stage, respectively, from the differentially expressed non-SMGs by using the variable combination population analysis (VCPA) approach and found that 69.6% (16/23), 78.9% (15/19) and 66.7% (16/24) of the identified non-SMGs had been previously reported to be correlated with cancers. In addition, the averaged areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) achieved by the predictive models with identified non-SMGs as predictors in predicting histological type, histological grade, and FIGO stage were 0.993, 0.961 and 0.832, respectively, which were superior to those achieved by the models with SMGs as features (averaged AUCs = 0.928, 0.864 and 0.535, resp.). Conclusions: Besides the SMGs, the non-SMGs reported in the mutation annotation analysis may also involve the crucial genes that were highly associated with clinical outcomes. Combining the mutation status with the gene expression profiles can efficiently identify the cancer-related non-SMGs as predictors for cancer prognostic prediction and provide more supplemental candidates for the discovery of biomarkers. © 2017 The Author(s).","Clinical phenotype characteristics; Differentially expressed genes; Endometrial cancer; RNA sequencing; Somatic mutation",Article,Scopus

The pathogenesis of lung squamous carcinoma is not clear,and we here presented an effective method to identify lung squamous carcinoma risk pathway,helping to elucidate the pathogenesis of lung squamous carcinoma.METHODS We first integrated eight public database resources to obtain regulation data about transcription factor (TF),long non-coding RNA (lncRNA),miRNA and Gene. Then transcriptome sequencing data including TF,lncRNA,miRNA and Gene about lung squamous carcinoma were obtained from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data resources. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated about these regulation relationships,and we got a transcriptional regulatory network associated with lung squamous cell carcinoma. Taking each node with zero in-degree as the starting node,we identified the cascade pathways from the network using the breadth-first search algorithm. Lung cancer related TF,lncRNA,miRNA and Gene were downloaded from disease databases,and we annotated the cascade pathways with lung cancer information. The cascades with high disease annotation rate were regarded as lung squamous carcinoma risk pathways.RESULTS We integrated eight public database resources to retrieve 21 597 candidate regulation relationships, including TF versus lncRNA,miRNA and Gene,lncRNA versus TF and Gene and miRNA versus TF,lncRNA and Gene. After filtering the pairs with spearman correlation coefficients P-value<0.01,we constructed a lung squamous carcinoma related regulatory network,including 2 234 pairs consisted of 91 TFs,552 lncRNAs,125 miRNAs and 937 Genes. By breadth-first search algorithm,we identified 10 941 cascades. After annotated these cascades with lung cancer information,36 cascades with annotation ratio 1 were obtained,and these cascades were deemed as lung squamous carcinoma risk pathways. In the end,we provided nine candidate small molecules for lung squamous carcinoma therapy based on identified risk pathways.CONCLUSION The constructed transcriptional regulation network can help to identify lung squamous carcinoma risk pathways,explain the pathogenesis of lung squamous cell carcinoma and predict the candidate clinical drugs for lung squamous carcinoma therapy. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 687 patients who underwent laparoscopic total gastrectomy for gastric cancer at a single institution from August 2008 to August 2014. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of operation: 421 patients underwent TLTG and 266 underwent LATG. Clinicopathologic characteristics and surgical outcomes in the two groups were compared and analyzed. RESULTS The TLTG group had higher mean ages at the time of operation (57.78 ± 11.20 years and 55.69 ± 11.96 years, P = 0.020) and more histories of abdominal surgery (20.2% and 12.4%, P = 0.008) compared with the LATG group. Surgical outcomes such as intraoperative and postoperative transfusions, combined operations, pain scores and administration of analgesics, and complications were similar between the two groups. However, compared with the LATG group, the TLTG group required a shorter operation time (149 min vs 170 min, P < 0.001), had lower postoperative hematocrit change (3.49% vs 4.04%, P = 0.002), less intraoperative events (3.1% vs 10.2%, P < 0.001), less intraoperative anastomosis events (2.4% vs 7.1%, P = 0.003), faster postoperative recovery such as median time to first flatus (3.30 d vs 3.60 d, P < 0.001), faster median commencement of soft diet (4.30 d vs 4.60 d, P < 0.001) and shorter length of postoperative hospital stay (6.75 d vs 7.02 d, P = 0.005). CONCLUSION The intracorporeal method for reconstruction of esophagojejunostomy using a linear stapler may be considered a feasible procedure comparing with extracorporeal anastomosis using circular stapler because TLTG is simpler and more straightforward than LATG. Therefore, TLTG can be recommended as an appropriate procedure for gastric cancer. © The author(s) 2017. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Fhit belongs to the histidine triad family of enzymes that catalyze the degradation of nucleoside 5',5'-triphosphates, including the m7GpppN 'caps' that are generated when mRNAs undergo 3'-5' decay. This raised the possibility that Fhit loss might affect changes in the translation of cancer-associated mRNAs, possibly as a consequence of increased intracellular concentrations of these molecules. Results: Ribosome profiling identified several hundred mRNAs for which coding region ribosome occupancy changed as a function of Fhit expression. While many of these changes could be explained by changes in mRNA steady-state, a subset of these showed changes in translation efficiency as a function of Fhit expression. The onset of malignancy has been linked to changes in 5'-UTR ribosome occupancy and this analysis also identified ribosome binding to 5'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of a number of cancer-associated mRNAs. 5'-UTR ribosome occupancy of these mRNAs differed between Fhit-negative and Fhit-positive cells, and in some cases these differences correlated with differences in coding region ribosome occupancy. Conclusions: In summary, these findings show Fhit expression impacts the translation of a number of cancer associated genes, and they support the hypothesis that Fhit's genome protective/tumor suppressor function is associated with post-transcriptional changes in expression of genes whose dysregulation contributes to malignancy. © 2017 The Author(s).","Fhit; Gene expression; Ribosome profiling; Scavenger decapping; Translational control",Article,Scopus

Models of cancer-induced neuropathy are designed by injecting cancer cells near the peripheral nerves. -e interference of tissue-resident immune cells does not allow a direct contact with nerve 2bres which a3ects the tumor microenvironment and the invasion process. Methods. Anaplastic tumor-1 (AT-1) cells were inoculated within the sciatic nerves (SNs) of male Copenhagen rats. Lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and the SNs were collected on days 3, 7, 14, and 21. SN tissues were examined for morphological changes and DRG tissues for immuno=uorescence, electrophoretic tendency, and mRNA quanti2cation. Hypersensitivities to cold, mechanical, and thermal stimuli were determined. HC-030031, a selective TRPA1 antagonist, was used to treat cold allodynia. Results. Nociception thresholds were identi2ed on day 6. Immuno=uorescent micrographs showed overexpression of TRPA1 on days 7 and 14 and of CGRP on day 14 until day 21. Both TRPA1 and CGRP were coexpressed on the same cells. Immunoblots exhibited an increase in TRPA1 expression on day 14. TRPA1 mRNA underwent an increase on day 7 (normalized to 18S). Injection of HC-030031 transiently reversed the cold allodynia. Conclusion. A novel and a promising model of cancer-induced neuropathy was established, and the role of TRPA1 and CGRP in pain transduction was examined.

METHODS Paired gastric normal fibroblast (GNF) and gastric cancer-associated fibroblast (GCAF) cultures were established from resected tissues. GCAFs were treated with vehicle control or different concentrations of astragaloside ?. Conditioned media were prepared from GNFs, GCAFs, control-treated GCAFs, and astragaloside ?-treated GCAFs, and used to culture BGC-823 human gastric cancer cells. Proliferation, migration and invasion capacities of BGC-823 cells were determined by MTT, wound healing, and Transwell invasion assays, respectively. The action mechanism of astragaloside ? was investigated by detecting the expression of microRNAs and the expression and secretion of the oncogenic factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and the tumor suppressive factor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2), in different groups of GCAFs. The expression of the oncogenic pluripotency factors SOX2 and NANOG in BGC-823 cells cultured with different conditioned media was also examined. RESULTS GCAFs displayed higher capacities to induce BGC-823 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion than GNFs (P < 0.01). Astragaloside ? treatment strongly inhibited the proliferation-, migration- and invasion-promoting capacities of GCAFs (P < 0.05 for 10 µmol/L, P < 0.01 for 20 µmol/L and 40 µmol/L). Compared with GNFs, GCAFs expressed a lower level of microRNA-214 (P < 0.01) and a higher level of microRNA-301a (P < 0.01). Astragaloside ? treatment significantly up-regulated microRNA-214 expression (P < 0.01) and down-regulated microRNA-301a expression (P < 0.01) in GCAFs. Reestablishing the microRNA expression balance subsequently suppressed M-CSF production (P < 0.01) and secretion (P < 0.05), and elevated TIMP2 production (P < 0.01) and secretion (P < 0.05). Consequently, the ability of GCAFs to increase SOX2 and NANOG expression in BGC-823 cells was abolished by astragaloside ?. CONCLUSION Astragaloside ? can inhibit the pathological functions of GCAFs by correcting their dysregulation of microRNA expression, and it is promisingly a potent therapeutic agent regulating tumor microenvironment. © The Author(s) 2017.

Clinical studies suggest that intra-peritoneal (i.p.) chemotherapy effectively treats residual EOC after cyto-reduction by gaining direct access into the peritoneal cavity, enabling elevated drug levels versus intravenous (i.v.) injection. However, chemoresistant disease is still problematic. To overcome resistance against microtubule stabilizing agents such as taxanes, epothilone B (EpoB) has merit, especially in combination with molecular targeted agents that inhibit heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and/or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In this paper, we report on the successful loading and solubilization of EpoB in a poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)-block-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA-b-PEG-b-PLGA) thermosensitive gel (g-E). Further, we report on successful co-loading of 17-AAG (Hsp90) and rapamycin (mTOR) (g-EAR). After i.p. injection in mice, g-EAR showed gelation in the peritoneum and sustained, local-regional release of EpoB, 17-AAG, and rapamycin. In a luciferase-expressing ES-2 (ES-2-luc) ovarian cancer xenograft model, single i.p. injections of g-E and g-EAR delayed bioluminescence from metastasizing ES-2-luc cells for 2 and 3 weeks, respectively, despite fast drug release for g-EAR in vivo versus in vitro. In summary, a PLGA-b-PEG-b-PLGA sol-gel has loading and release capacities for EpoB and its combinations with 17-AAG and rapamycin, enabling a platform for i.p. delivery, sustained multi-drug exposure, and potent antitumor efficacy in an ES-2-luc, ovarian cancer i.p. xenograft model. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Drug combination; Epothilone B; Intraperitoneal injection; Ovarian cancer; Peritoneal carcinomatosis; Thermogel",Article,Scopus

After analyses of the pharmacophore and WPF interaction optimization, we designed a small-molecule inhibitor of BRD4, 9f (FL-411) which was validated by cocrystal structure with BD1 of BRD4. Subsequently, 9f was discovered to induce ATG5-dependent autophagy-associated cell death (ACD) by blocking BRD4-AMPK interaction and thus activating AMPK-mTOR-ULK1-modulated autophagic pathway in breast cancer cells. Interestingly, the iTRAQ-based proteomics analyses revealed that 9f induced ACD pathways involved in HMGB1, VDAC1/2, and eEF2.

Upregulation of NETO2 gene was also detected in several cancer types. In colorectal cancer (CRC), it was associated with tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis, and seems to be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the mechanism of NETO2 action is still poorly understood. Results: We have revealed significant increase in the expression of NETO2 gene and deregulation of eight EMT-related genes in CRC. Four of them were upregulated (TWIST1, SNAIL1, LEF1, and FOXA2); the mRNA levels of other genes (FOXA1, BMP2, BMP5, and SMAD7) were decreased. Expression of NETO2 gene was weakly correlated with that of genes involved in the EMT process. Conclusions: We found considerable NETO2 upregulation, but no significant correlation between the expression of NETO2 and EMT-related genes in CRC. Thus, NETO2 may be involved in CRC progression, but is not directly associated with EMT. © 2017 The Author(s).","Colorectal cancer; Epithelial-mesenchymal transition; Gene expression; NETO2; QPCR",Article,Scopus

Despite promising results in other cancers, compounds targeting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, alone or in combination with Ras/Raf/MEK pathway inhibitors, have not been evaluated in BTC. Here, we examined the effects of a pan-PI3K inhibitor (BKM120) with or without a MEK inhibitor (MEK162), on eight human BTC cell lines carrying mutations in K-Ras and/or the PI3K catalytic subunit, PI3KCA. BKM120 inhibited the colony-forming ability and migration of BTC cells carrying wild-type (WT) PI3KCA and either mutant (MT) or WT K-Ras, but not of cells carrying mutations in both genes. In K-Ras-WT cells, BKM120 decreased the phosphorylation of Akt, its downstream effector kinase p70S6K, and the translational repressor 4E-BP1. Interestingly, BKM120 did not induce cell cycle arrest or suppress PI3K signaling via restoration of p-4E-BP1 in cells with PIK3CA and K-Ras double mutations.

METHODS In all, 321 cases of T1-stage CRC were selected from 10132 patients with CRC who received surgical therapy in six large-scale hospitals in China and were retrospectively analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to analyze the risk factors for lymphatic metastasis. A survival analysis was then performed to analyze the prognostic value of lymph node metastasis. RESULTS The occurrence rate of T1 stage was 3.17% (321/10132); of these patients, the lymph node metastasis rate was 8.41% (27/321), and the non-lymph node metastasis rate was 91.59% (294/321). Univariate analysis showed that preoperative serum CEA, preoperative serum CA199, preoperative serum CA724, vascular invasion, and degree of differentiation were associated with lymph node metastasis in T1-stage CRC (P &lt; 0.05 for all). Multivariate analysis indicated that preoperative serum CA724, vascular invasion, and degree of differentiation were closely related to lymph node metastasis (P &lt; 0.05 for all). Log-rank survival analysis showed that age, preoperative serum CEA, preoperative serum CA199, vascular invasion, degree of differentiation, and lymph node metastasis (? 2 = 24.180, P &lt; 0.001) were predictors of 5-year overall survival (OS) (P &lt; 0.05 for all). COX regression analysis demonstrated that preoperative serum CA199 and lymph node metastasis (HR = 5.117; P &lt; 0.05; 95%CI: 0.058-0.815) were independent prognostic indicators of 5-year OS in patients with T1-stage CRC (P &lt; 0.05 for both). CONCLUSION The morbidity of T1-stage CRC was 3.17% for all CRC cases. Preoperative serum CA724, vascular invasion, and degree of differentiation are independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis.

Although ABT-737, a B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitor, exerts anticancer effects against BCL-2-expressing SCLC, monotherapy with ABT-737 is associated with limited clinical activity because of the development of resistance and toxicity. Here, we examined whether combination therapy with ABT-737 and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor NVP-AUY922 exerted synergistic anticancer effects on SCLC. We found that the combination of ABT-737 and NVP-AUY922 synergistically induced the apoptosis of BCL-2-expressing SCLC cells. NVP-AUY922 downregulated the expression of AKT and ERK, which activate MCL-1 to induce resistance against ABT-737. The synergistic effect was also partly due to blocking NF-κB activation, which induces anti-apoptosis protein expressions. However, interestingly, targeting BCL-2 and MCL-1 or BCL2 and NF-κB did not induce the cytotoxicity. In conclusion, our study showed that combination of BCL2 inhibitor with HSP90 inhibitor increased activity in in vitro and in vivo study in only BCL-2 expressing SCLC compared to either single BCL2 inhibitor or HSP inhibitor. The enhanced activity might be led by blocking several apoptotic pathways simultaneously rather than a specific pathway. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","BCL-2 inhibitor; Combination therapy; HSP90 inhibitor; Small cell lung cancer",Article,Scopus

In the treatment-resistant tumors we noted the emergence of CD31-negative patent neovessels and a concomitant loss of tumor homing of the nanosystem. In vivo phage library screening in mice bearing non-responder tumors showed that compared to untreated and treatment-sensitive tumors, treatment sensitive tumors yield a distinct landscape of vascular homing peptides characterized by over-representation of peptides that target αv integrins.

The expression of IQGAP1 and its SUMOylation level are both increased in human colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells and tissues. IQGAP1 is mainly SUMOylated by SUMO1 at the K1445 residue, which could stabilize IQGAP1 by reducing protein ubiquitination.

However, safety and efficacy of this approach is often limited by inappropriate biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of the proteins when they are administered systemically. Local administration of gene therapy vectors encoding these proteins would be a feasible alternative if they could mediate long-term and controlled expression of the transgene after a single intratumoral administration. We describe a new vector platform specially designed for this purpose. Different combinations of transactivators and promoters were evaluated to obtain a fully humanized inducible system responsive to the well-characterized drug mifepristone. The optimal transactivator conformation was based on DNA binding domains from the chimeric protein ZFHD1 fused to the progesterone receptor ligand binding domain and the NFkb p65 activation domain. The expression of this hybrid transactivator under the control of the elongation factor 1α (EF1α) or the chimeric CAG promoters ensured functionality of the system in a variety of cancer types. Expression cassettes with luciferase as a reporter gene were incorporated into High-Capacity adenoviral vectors (HC-Ad) for in vivo evaluation. Systemic administration of the vectors into C57BL/6 mice revealed that the vector based on the EF1α promoter (HCA-EF-ZP) allows tight control of transgene expression and remains stable for at least two months, whereas the CAG promoter suffers a progressive inactivation. Using an orthotopic pancreatic cancer model in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice we show that the local administration of HCA-EF-ZP achieves better tumor/liver ratio of luciferase production than the intravenous route. However, regional spread of the vector led to substantial transgene expression in peritoneal organs. We reduced this leakage through genetic modification of the vector capsid to display RGD and poly-lysine motifs in the fiber knob. Safety and antitumor effect of this gene therapy platform was demonstrated using interleukin-12 as a therapeutic gene. In conclusion, we have developed a new tool that allows local, sustained and controlled production of therapeutic proteins in tumors. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,Article,Scopus

Semaphorin 3F (SEMA3F) is highly conserved but present at a lower level in various cancers than in healthy tissues. While it has been reported that SEMA3F is involved in cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion, its function in OSCC remains unknown. Methods: The expression of SEMA3F in OSCC tissues and OSCC-derived cells was analyzed using qRT-PCR and western blotting. Using SAS and HSC2 cells, we also monitored the effect of SEMA3F on OSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion using MTT, colony formation and transwell assays. The function of SEMA3F in OSCC tumor formation was also assessed in vivo. Results: SEMA3F was significantly downregulated in OSCC tissues and OSCC-derived cells. SEMA3F shows growth inhibitory activity in SAS and HSC2 cells and may act as a tumor suppressor. It can inhibit the migration and invasion potential of OSCC cells. Our results also demonstrate that SEMA3F can suppress the growth of OSCC cells in vivo.

METHODS Two independent investigators systematically reviewed all original scientific articles published between January, 2000, and July, 2017, using PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE. A total of 355 articles were screened at the abstract level. Of these, only original scientific human, animal, and in vitro studies investigating Fusobacterium and its relationship with colorectal cancer (CRC) were included in the analysis. Abstracts, review articles, studies investigating other colonic diseases, and studies written in other languages than English were excluded from our analysis. Ninety articles were included after removing duplicates, resolving disagreements between the two reviewers, and applying the above criteria. RESULTS Studies have consistently identified positive associations between Fusobacterium , especially Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum ), and CRC. Stronger associations were seen in CRCs proximal to the splenic flexure and CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)-high CRCs. There was evidence of temporality and a biological gradient, with increased F. nucleatum DNA detection and quantity along the traditional adenoma-carcinoma sequence and in CIMP-high CRC precursors. Diet may have a differential impact on colonic F. nucleatum enrichment; evidence suggests that high fiber diet may reduce the risk of a subset of CRCs that are F. nucleatum DNA-positive. Data also suggest shorter CRC and disease-specific survival with increased amount of F. nucleatum DNA in CRC tissue. The pathophysiology of enrichment of F. nucleatum and other Fusobacterium species in colonic tissue is unclear; however, the virulence factors and changes to the local colonic environment with disruption of the protective mucus layer may contribute. The presence of a host lectin (Gal-GalNAc) in the colonic epithelium may also mediate F. nucleatum attachment to CRC and precursors through interaction with an F. nucleatum protein, fibroblast activation protein 2 (FAP2). The clinical significance of detection or enrichment of Fusobacterium in colorectal neoplasia is ambiguous, but data suggest a procarcinogenic effect of F. nucleatum , likely due to activation of oncogenic and inflammatory pathways and modulation of the tumor immune environment. This is hypothesized to be mediated by certain F. nucleatum strains carrying invasive properties and virulence factors such as FadA and FAP.

The present study evaluated the effect of chemotherapeutic agents on exosome production and/or release, and quantified the contribution of exosomes to intercellular drug transfer and pharmacodynamics. Methods Human cancer cells (breast MCF7, breast-to-lung metastatic LM2, ovarian A2780 and OVCAR4) were treated with paclitaxel (PTX, 2–1000 nM) or doxorubicin (DOX, 20–1000 nM) for 24–48 h. Exosomes were isolated from the culture medium of drug-treated donor cells (Donor cells) using ultra-centrifugation, and analyzed for acetylcholinesterase activity, total proteins, drug concentrations, and biological effects (cytotoxicity and anti-migration) on drug-naïve recipient cells (Recipient cells). These results were used to develop computational predictive quantitative pharmacology models. Results Cells in exponential growth phase released ~ 220 exosomes/cell in culture medium. PTX and DOX significantly promoted exosome production and/or release in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with greater effects in ovarian cancer cells than in breast cancer cells. Exosomes isolated from Donor cells contained appreciable drug levels (2–7 pmole/106 cells after 24 h treatment with 100–1000 nM PTX), and caused cytotoxicity and inhibited migration of Recipient cells. Quantitative pharmacology models that integrated cellular PTX pharmacokinetics with PTX pharmacodynamics successfully predicted effects of exosomes on intercellular drug transfer, cytotoxicity of PTX on Donor cells and cytotoxicity of PTX-containing exosomes on Recipient cells. Additional model simulations indicate that within clinically achievable PTX concentrations, the contribution of exosomes to active drug efflux increased with drug concentration and exceeded the p-glycoprotein efflux when the latter was saturated. Conclusions Our results indicate (a) chemotherapeutic agents stimulate exosome production or release, and (b) exosome is a mechanism of intercellular drug transfer that contributes to pharmacodynamics of neighboring cells. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Chemoresistance; Exocytosis; Exosome; Intercellular drug transfer; Quantitative pharmacology",Article,Scopus

In this study, we have investigated how AR inhibition prevents CRC growth by regulating the mitochondrial biogenesis via Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Incubation of CRC cells such as SW-480, HT29, and HCT116 with AR inhibitor, fidarestat that non-covalently binds to the enzyme, increases the expression of Nrf2. Further, fidarestat augmented the EGF-induced expression of Nrf2 in CRC cells. Fidarestat also increased the Nrf2 -DNA binding activity as well as expression of HO-1 and NQO1 and activation of SOD and catalase in SW480 cells. Similarly, in nude mice xenograft tumor tissues, Nrf2 and HO-1 levels were significantly higher in fidarestat-treated mice compared to controls. Further, stimulation of CRC cells with EGF in the presence of fidarestat increased the mRNA levels of PGC-1α, Nrf1 and TFAM and protein levels of PGC-1α, TFAM and COX-IV and decreased the mitochondrial DNA damage as measured by 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine levels. AR inhibitor also modulated the phosphorylations of AMPK and mTOR and expression of p53 in EGF-treated cells. Collectively, our results indicate that AR inhibitor prevents CRC growth by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis via increasing the expression of Nrf2/HO-1/AMPK/p53 and decreasing the mitochondrial DNA damage. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Aldose reductase; Colon cancer; Fidarestat; Growth factors; Heme oxygenase-1; Mitochondria; Nrf2; Oxidative stress",Article,Scopus

The relationship between Ang-2 and head neck squamous cell carcinoma(HNSCC) remains uncleaar. This meta-analysis was to explore the association between expression of Ang-2 and HNSCC. METHODS Databases as PubMed,EMBASE,Cocharance Library,Chinese Biomedical Literature Database(CBM),China National Knowledge Infrastructure(CNKI),VIP and WangFang Data were electronically searched from the inception to April 2017 to collect case-control studies published about the association between Ang-2 expression and clinical pathogenic features in HNSCC. Two reviewers screened literatures,extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of included studies independently. RevMan 5.3 software was used to perform meta-analysis. RESULTS Eleven case-control studies with 639 HNSCC cases and 168 controls were included. According to our results,the expression of Ang-2 in HNSCC tissue was higher than in formal control(OR=6.68,95%CI:4.43-10.08). In additon,the Ang-2 expression was positively correlate with lymph node metastasis(OR=2.29,95%CI:1.50-3.48),and tumor stage(OR=0.42,95%CI:0.21-0.86), but seems to have no significant impact on tumor differentiation(OR=0.62,95%CI:0.28-1.40). CONCLUSIONS Current results demonstrate that Ang-2 could regulate the angiogenesis which may influence the occurrence,invasion and metastasis of HNSCC and may be corrected with tumor malignance.

Methods: The samples of the whole aerial tissues (including stems, leaves, branches) were collected in Yichun area of Jiangxi Province and were authenticated by relevant experts. General RNA was extracted from the crude drugs and processed products of L. casuarinoides, respectively. High-qualified small RNAs (sRNA) were isolated to be constructed the sRNA sequencing library. Then, the single-ended sequencing was conducted by using Illumina HiSeqTM 2500 sequencing method. MiRNA characteristic of L. casuarinoides was analyzed by relevant bioinformatics. Results: 9 898 332 and 10 099 918 clean reads were obtained from crude drugs group and processed products group, respectively. A total of 25 microRNAs were differentially expressed between crude drugs group and processed products groups with statistical significance, among which 22 were up regulated and three were down-regulated in processed products group compared to those in the crude drugs group. GO (gene ontology) analysis showed that their homo sapiens targets were enriched in catalytic binding, molecular transducer and KEGG (Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes) analysis was shown for the target genes enriched in cancer and immunity-related pathways, such as pathways in cancer, proteoglycans in cancer. Conclusion: The differential expression profile of microRNAs is first revealed by two processing forms of L. casuarinoides.

These trials also require a different approach to funding and data collection. Challenges and discussion: From the statisticians' viewpoint, we highlight what is needed to move from running rule-based, early-phase trials to running a model-based phase I study as we experienced it in our trials unit located in the United Kingdom. Our example is CHARIOT, a dose-finding trial using the time-to-event continual reassessment method. It consists of three stages and aims to discover the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and the ataxia telangiectasia mutated Rad3-related inhibitor M6620 (previously known as VX-970) in patients with oesophageal cancer. We present the challenges we faced in designing this trial and how we overcame them as a way of demystifying the conduct of a model-based trial in a grant-funded clinical trials unit. Conclusions: Although we appreciate that undertaking model-based trials requires additional time and effort, they are feasible to implement and, once suitable tools such as guiding publications and document templates become available, the design and set-up process will be easier and more efficient. © 2017 The Author(s).","Continual reassessment method; CRM; Design; Dose-finding; Model-based; Phase I",Note,Scopus

METHODS The cirrhotic patients with BCLC stage C HCC evaluated by the Hepatocatt multidisciplinary group were subjected to the investigation. Demographic, clinical and tumor features, along with the best tumor response and overall survival were recorded. RESULTS One hundred and ten BCLC stage C patients were included in the analysis; the median overall survival was 13.4 mo (95%CI: 10.6-17.0). Only alphafetoprotein (AFP) serum level > 200 ng/mL and DC could independently predict survival but in a time dependent manner, the former was significantly associated with increased risk of mortality within the first 6 mo of follow-up (HR = 5.073, 95%CI: 2.159-11.916, P = 0.0002), whereas the latter showed a protective effect against death after one year (HR = 0.110, 95%CI: 0.038-0.314, P < 0.0001). Only patients showing microvascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread recorded lower chances of achieving DC (OR = 0.263, 95%CI: 0.111-0.622, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION The BCLC stage C HCC includes a wide heterogeneous group of cirrhotic patients suitable for potentially curative treatments. The reverse and time dependent effect of AFP serum level and DC on patients' survival confers them as useful predictive tools for treatment management and clinical decisions. © The Author(s) 2017.","Alphafetoprotein; Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C; Cirrhosis; Disease control; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Performance status; Survival",Article,Scopus

With a 5-year survival rate below 12%, effective therapies for HCC are needed. Current treatments for HCC include microwave and radiofrequency ablation, high intensity focused ultrasound, liver transplant, surgical resection, and localized embolizations. However, each of these approaches has some limitation, making it imperative to develop improved methods for sensitizing tumors prior to therapy. We hypothesized that the use of ultrasound-triggered microbubble destruction (UTMD), which sensitizes tumors to radiotherapy by inducing vascular endothelial cell apoptosis, will selectively sensitize malignant tissue to radiotherapy and improve outcomes. To test this, 18 nude rats were inoculated in the right liver lobe with Hu7.5 HCC cells and after tumor formation, received 5 Gy radiotherapy, UTMD, or UTMD prior to radiotherapy. Compared to radiotherapy alone, there was a 170% reduction in tumor growth 7 days post treatment and a 3.2X improvement in median survival time when radiotherapy was combined with UTMD. These results indicate that UTMD is an effective adjunct when combined with radiotherapy to treat HCC. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Antivascular therapy; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Radiotherapy; Ultrasound contrast agent; Ultrasound triggered microbubble destruction",Article,Scopus

The combinational therapy strategy of RNA interfering (RNAi) technology and chemotherapeutic agents have been reported to be promising for effective cancer therapy. In this study, based on multifunctional nanoparticles (NPs), the simultaneous delivery of etoposide (ETP) and anti-Enhancer of Zeste Homologue 2 (EZH2) siRNA for the effective treatment of orthotopic lung tumor was achieved. The NPs exhibited pH/redox dual sensitivity verified by particle size changes, morphological changes, and in vitro release of drugs. Confocal microscopy analysis confirmed that the NPs exhibited endosomal escape property and on-demand intracellular drug release behavior, which can protect siRNA from degradation and facilitate the chemotherapeutic effect respectively. In vitro tumor cell motility study demonstrated that EZH2 siRNA loaded in NPs can decrease the migration and invasion capabilities of tumor cells by downregulating the expression of EZH2 mRNA and protein. In particular, an antiproliferation study revealed that the co-delivery of siRNA and ETP in the multifunctional NPs can induce a synergistic therapeutic effect on NSCLC. In vivo targeting evaluation showed that cRGDyC-PEG modification on NPs exhibited a low distribution in normal organs and an obvious accumulation in orthotopic lung tumor. Furthermore, targeted NPs co-delivering siRNA and ETP showed superior inhibition on tumor growth and metastasis and produced minimal systemic toxicity. These findings indicated that multifunctional NPs can be utilized as a co-delivery system, and that the combination of EZH2 siRNA and ETP can effectively treat NSCLC. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Co-delivery system; ETP; EZH2 siRNA; NPs; NSCLC",Article,Scopus

We previously found a positive association between rat mammary tumor levels of the n-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA) and tumor weight. We examined the roles of the major n-3 PUFA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), and the major n-6 PUFA, AA, in FASN expression in, and proliferation of, human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Methods: The cells were treated for 48 h with BSA or 60 μM BSA-bound DHA, AA, or oleic acid (OA, 18:1n-9), then were incubated with or without estradiol or insulin. Western blot and 3H-thymidine incorporation assay were used to determine the role of DHA on FASN regulation and MCF-7 cell proliferation. Results: DHA, but neither AA nor OA, inhibits estradiol-induced and insulin-induced expression of the precursor of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (p-SREBP-1), its mature form (m-SREBP-1), and FASN. Estradiol or insulin stimulation increased the pAkt/Akt and pS6/S6 ratios, expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN, and cell proliferation, and these effects were decreased by DHA. The DHA-induced decrease in FASN expression resulted from reduced pAkt/Akt signaling and not pERK1/2/ERK1/2 signaling. In addition, DHA enhanced the inhibitory effect of LY294002 on pAkt signaling and expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN. However, addition of rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR signaling pathways, 1 h before addition of estradiol or insulin increased the pAkt/Akt ratio and FASN expression, and this effect was inhibited by addition of DHA 48 h before rapamycin. Conclusion: We conclude that, in MCF-7 cells, DHA inhibits pAKT signaling and thus expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN and cell proliferation. © 2017 The Author(s).","Arachidonic acid; Breast cancer; Docosahexaenoic acid; Estrogen; Fatty acid synthase; Fatty acids; Insulin; MTOR; PAKT signaling; Proliferation",Article,Scopus

The GenColon study investigated potential associations between variant alleles of UGTs, efflux and influx transporters and CRC. Methods: Three hundred CRC cases were matched with 300 controls for age, sex and enrolment site. Fifteen SNPs in UGT1A6-9, UGT2B7, ABCB1, ABCC2, SLCO1B1 and SLCO2B1 genes were characterized using Taqman® PCR. Using multivariate conditional logistic regression, we investigated the relationships between CRC and ""environmental"" risk factors (physical activity, housing and working areas, consumption of red meat, tobacco, alcohol); genetic polymorphisms, in the study population and in the subgroups with ""environmental"" risk factors. Results: No significant association was observed for the analyzed SNPs (or haplotypes).

In addition, as previously reported, the following CRC risk factors were identified: absence of physical activity (OR = 6.35[3.70-10.9], p < 0.0001), living or working in rural or mix area (OR = 2.50[1.48-4.23], p = 0.0006 and OR = 2.99[1.63-5.48], p = 0.004, respectively) and tobacco exposure >30 years (3.37[1.63-6.96], p = 0.0010). Conclusions: Variant genotypes of influx transporters (OATP1B1 and 2B1) were not associated with CRC.

Objective measures, differentiating these types of polyps would improve cancer prevention and treatment outcome. Methods: RNA-seq training data set and Affimetrix, Illumina testing data sets were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). RNA-seq single-end reads were filtered with FastX toolkit. Read mapping to the human genome, gene abundance estimation, and differential expression analysis were performed with Tophat-Cufflinks pipeline. Background correction, normalization, and probe summarization steps for Affimetrix arrays were performed using the robust multi-array method (RMA). For Illumina arrays, log2-scale expression data was obtained from GEO. Pathway analysis was implemented using Bioconductor package GSAR. To build a platform-independent molecular classifier that accurately differentiates sessile serrated and hyperplastic polyps we developed a new feature selection step. We also developed a simple procedure to classify new samples as either sessile serrated or hyperplastic with a class probability assigned to the decision, estimated using Cantelli's inequality. Results: The classifier trained on RNA-seq data and tested on two independent microarray data sets resulted in zero and three errors. The classifier was further tested using quantitative real-time PCR expression levels of 45 blinded independent formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens and was highly accurate. Pathway analyses have shown that sessile serrated polyps are distinguished from hyperplastic polyps and normal controls by: up-regulation of pathways implicated in proliferation, inflammation, cell-cell adhesion and down-regulation of serine threonine kinase signaling pathway; differential co-expression of pathways regulating cell division, protein trafficking and kinase activities. Conclusions: Most of the differentially expressed pathways are known as hallmarks of cancer and likely to explain why sessile serrated polyps are more prone to neoplastic transformation than hyperplastic. The new molecular classifier includes 13 genes and may facilitate objective differentiation between two polyps. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cantelli's inequality; Feature selection; Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded; Hyperplastic polyps; Microarrays; Molecular signature; RNA-seq; Sessile serrated adenoma/polys; Shrunken centroid classifier; Summary metric",Article,Scopus

The presence of a large population of macrophages (Mφ) in the tumor microenvironment is a prominent feature of GBM and these so-called tumor-associated Mφ (TAM) closely interact with the GBM cells to promote the survival, progression and therapy resistance of the GBM. Various therapeutic strategies have been devised either targeting the GBM cells or the TAM but few have addressed the cross-talks between the two cell populations. The present study was carried out to explore the possibility of exploiting the cross-talks between the GBM cells (GC) and TAM for modulation of the GBM microenvironment through using Nano-DOX, a drug composite based on nanodiamonds bearing doxorubicin. In the in vitro work on human cell models, Nano-DOX-loaded TAM were first shown to be viable and able to infiltrate three-dimensional GC spheroids and release cargo drug therein. GC were then demonstrated to encourage Nano-DOX-loaded TAM to unload Nano-DOX back into GC which consequently emitted damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that are powerful immunostimulatory agents as well as indicators of cell damage. Nano-DOX was next proven to be a more potent inducer of GC DAMPs emission than doxorubicin. As a result, Nano-DOX-damaged GC exhibited an enhanced ability to attract both TAM and Nano-DOX-loaded TAM. Most remarkably, Nano-DOX-damaged GC reprogrammed the TAM from a pro-GBM phenotype to an anti-GBM phenotype that suppressed GC growth. Finally, the in vivo relevance of the in vitro findings was tested in animal study. Mice bearing orthotopic human GBM xenografts were intravenously injected with Nano-DOX-loaded mouse TAM which were found releasing drug in the GBM xenografts 24 h after injection. GC damage was evidenced by the induction of DAMPs emission within the xenografts and a shift of TAM phenotype was detected as well. Taken together, our results demonstrate a novel way with therapeutic potential to harness the cross-talk between GBM cells and TAM for modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cancer cell; Cancer-associated macrophage; Cross-talk; Glioblastoma; Nano-drug",Article,Scopus

While the majority of de-novo malignancies after transplant usually consist of skin cancers, there has been an increasing rate of solid tumor cancers over the last 15 years. Although, recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is well understood among patients transplanted for HCC, there are increasing reports of de-novo HCC in those transplanted for a non-HCC indication. The proposed pathophysiology for these cases has been mainly connected to the presence of advanced graft fibrosis or cirrhosis and always associated with the presence of hepatitis B or C virus. We report the first known case of de-novo HCC in a recipient, 14 years after a pediatric living related donor liver transplantation for end-stage liver disease due to biliary atresia without the presence of hepatitis B or C virus before and after transplant. We present this case report to increase the awareness of this phenomenon and address on the utility for screening and surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma among these individuals. One recommendation is to use similar guidelines for screening, diagnosis, and treatment for HCC as those used for primary HCC in the pre-transplant patient, focusing on those recipients who have advanced fibrosis in the allograft, regardless of etiology. © The Author(s) 2017.","Biliary atresia; De-novo hepatocellular carcinoma; Liver transplantation; Living donor liver transplantation",Article,Scopus

However, the functions of Met which expresses in the nucleus (nMet) remain elusive. In this study, we found that nMet was increased in 89% of HCC tumorous tissues when compared with the corresponding non-tumorous liver tissues. nMet expression increased progressively along HCC development and significantly correlated with cirrhosis, poorer cellular differentiation, venous invasion, late stage HCC and poorer overall survival. Western blot analysis revealed that nMet is a 48-kDa protein comprising the carboxyl terminal of Met receptor. Induced expression of nMet promoted HCC cell growth, migration and invasiveness in vitro and tumorigenesis and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. Luciferase assay showed that nMet activated NF-κB pathway. Indeed, p-IKKα/β and nuclear p-p65 were higher in nMet stable cells than in the control cells. Perturbation of TAK1/NF-κB axis abrogated the aggressiveness of HCC cells, both in vitro and in vivo.

METHODS This was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled study comparing two CCE regimens. Subjects were asymptomatic and average risk for colorectal cancer. The second generation CCE system (PillCam® COLON 2; Medtronic, Yoqneam, Israel) was utilized. Preparation regimens differed in the 1st and 2nd boosts with the Study regimen using oral sulfate solution (89 mL) with diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium solution (“diatrizoate solution”) (boost 1 = 60 mL, boost 2 = 30 mL) and the Control regimen oral sulfate solution (89 mL) alone. The primary outcome was overall and segmental colon cleansing. Secondary outcomes included safety, polyp detection, colonic transit, CCE completion and capsule excretion = 12 h. RESULTS Both regimens had similar cleansing efficacy for the whole colon (Adequate: Study = 75.9%, Control = 77.3%; P = 0.88) and individual segments. In the Study group, CCE completion was superior (Study = 90.9%, Control = 76.9%; P = 0.048) and colonic transit was more often &lt; 40 min (Study = 21.8%, Control = 4%; P = 0.0073). More Study regimen subjects experienced adverse events (Study = 19.4%, Control = 3.4%; P = 0.0061), and this difference did not appear related to diatrizoate solution. Adverse events were primarily gastrointestinal in nature and no serious adverse events related either to the bowel preparation regimen or the capsule were observed. There was a trend toward higher polyp detection with the Study regimen, but this did not achieve statistical significance for any size category. Mean transit time through the entire gastrointestinal tract, from ingestion to excretion, was shorter with the Study regimen while mean colonic transit times were similar for both study groups. CONCLUSION A CCE bowel preparation regimen using oral sulfate solution and diatrizoate solution as a boost agent is effective, safe, and achieved superior CCE completion. © The Author(s) 2017.

Methods: The Dynamic Planning Module was used for decision making whether a plan adaptation was necessary within one course of radiation therapy. The Module was also used for patients scheduled for re-irradiation to estimate the dose in the pretreated region and calculate the accumulated dose to critical organs at risk. During one year, 370 patients were scheduled for plan adaptation or re-irradiation. All patient cases were classified according to their treated body region. For a sub-group of 20 patients treated with RT for lung cancer, the dosimetric effect of plan adaptation during the main treatment course was evaluated in detail. Changes in tumor volume, frequency of re-planning and the time interval between treatment start and plan adaptation were assessed. Results: The Dynamic Planning Tool was used in 20% of treated patients per year for both approaches nearly equally (42% plan adaptation and 58% re-irradiation). Most cases were assessed for the thoracic body region (51%) followed by pelvis (21%) and head and neck cases (10%). The sub-group evaluation showed that unintended plan adaptation was performed in 38% of the scheduled cases. A median time span between first day of treatment and necessity of adaptation of 17 days (range 4-35 days) was observed. PTV changed by 12 ± 12% on average (maximum change 42%). PTV decreased in 18 of 20 cases due to tumor shrinkage and increased in 2 of 20 cases. Re-planning resulted in a reduction of the mean lung dose of the ipsilateral side in 15 of 20 cases. Conclusion: The experience of one year showed high acceptance of the Dynamic Planning Module in our department for both physicians and medical physicists. The re-planning can potentially reduce the accumulated dose to the organs at risk and ensure a better target volume coverage. In the re-irradiation situation, the Dynamic Planning Tool was used to consider the pretreatment dose, to adapt the actual treatment schema more specifically and to review the accumulated dose. © 2017 The Author(s).","Adaptation; Lung cancer; Re-irradiation; Re-planning",Article,Scopus

Results: Twelve retrospective studies with 3129 patients were included. A meta-analysis of 11 studies suggested that the 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.41-0.57, I 2 = 37%, P &lt; 0.00001; OR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.12-0.38, I 2 = 43%, P &lt; 0.00001; OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.28-0.44, I 2 = 53%, P &lt; 0.00001; OR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.14-0.54, I 2 = 72%, P = 0.0001, respectively) favored HR over TACE.

Thus, herein a strategy was presented to utilize reversible vasodilatation effect of nitric oxide (NO) and size-controlled characteristic of ultrasound responsive liposome (URL) to construct a non-destructive nanomedicine, which was able to cross both obstacles simultaneously. In this work, URL was built as a carrier via forming a gas layer between lipid bilayer to encapsulate small particles PAMAM@DOX (PD, ~ 10 nm) and NO donation-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). Under ultrasound (US) stimulation, GSNO fastly generated NO that acting on tumor vascular smooth muscle, resulting in tumor vascular vasodilatation, meanwhile the URL lipid bilayer was destroyed, leading to release sharply of small nanoparticles PD. Combination vasodilatory effect of NO and size-controlled characteristic of URL allowed vast drugs to extravasate through endothelial gap and penetrate into tumor deep. Upon different types of cancers vary greatly in vascular structure, two distinctly different tumor, MCF-7 human breast carcinoma and MiaPaCa-2 human pancreatic carcinoma, were chosen to test the anticancer efficacy of URL. As a result, URL-based nanosystem was significantly more effective than the conventional liposome (CL) in tumor treatment, particularly in much less leaky MiaPaCa-2 tumor treatment (tumor therapeutic efficiency of URL/PD/GSNO + US increased by 32.5% and 56.5% compared to CL/DOX in MCF-7 and MiaPaCa-2 tumor treatment).

However, the major impediments that spike our accomplishment are the lack of universal biomarkers and cellular heterogeneity. To cope with these restrictions, we have tried to apply the concept of single cell analysis, which has hitherto been recommended throughout the world as an imperative solution pack for resolving such dilemmas. Accordingly, our first step was to utilize a predesigned spiral microchannel fabricated by our laboratory to perform size-based single cell separation using mast cell tumor (MCT) cells as a model. However, the impact of hydrodynamic shear stresses (HSS) on mechanical cell injury and viability in a spiral microchannel has not been fully investigated so far. Intuitively, our computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation has strongly revealed the formations of fluid shear stress (FSS) and extensional fluid stress (EFS) in the sorting system. The panel of biomedical assays has also disclosed cell degeneration and necrosis in the model. Therefore, we have herein reported the combinatorically detrimental effect of FSS and EFS on the viability of MCT cells after sorting in our spiral microchannel, with discussion on the possibly pathogenic mechanisms of HSS-induced cell injury in the study model. © 2017 by the authors.","Hydrodynamic shear stress; Microfluidic;mast cell tumor; Sorting; Spiralmicrochannel; Viability",Article,Scopus

HCC is expected to increase in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), due to endemic levels of viral infection (HBV/HIV), ageing and changing lifestyles. This unique aetiological background provides an opportunity for investigating potentially novel circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for HCC in a prospective study in South Africa. Methods: This study will recruit HCC patients from two South African cancer hospitals, situated in Durban and Pietermaritzburg in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. These cases will include both HBV mono-infected and HBV/HIV co-infected HCC cases. The control group will consist of two (2) age and sex-matched healthy population controls per HCC case randomly selected from a Durban based laboratory. The controls will exclude patients if they have any evidence of chronic liver disease. A standardised reporting approach will be adopted to detect, quantify and normalize the level of circulating miRNAs in the blood sera of HCC cases and their controls. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) will be employed to quantity extracellular miRNAs. Differences in concentration of relevant miRNA by case/control status will be assessed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney U) test. Adjustment for multiple testing (Bonferroni correction), receiver operating curves (ROC) and optimal breakpoint analyses will be employed to identify potential thresholds for the differentiation of miRNA levels of HCC cases and their controls. Discussion: Although there is a growing base of literature regarding the role of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers, this promising field remains a 'work in progress'. The aetiology of HBV infection in HCC is well understood, as well as it's role in miRNA deregulation, however, the mediating role of HIV infection is unknown. HCC incidence in SSA, including South Africa, is expected to increase significantly in the next decade. A combination of factors, therefore, offers a unique opportunity to identify candidate circulating miRNAs as potential biomarkers for HBV/HIV infected HCC. © 2017 The Author(s).","Biomarker; Diagnosis; HBV; Hepatocellular carcinoma; HIV; MiRNA; Staging",Article,Scopus

Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is one of the best studied probiotic strains, and doxorubicin (DOX) is conjugated onto EcN in the current study via acid-labile linkers of cis-aconitic anhydride (EcN-ca-Dox), realizing the bacteria-directed accumulation and acid-responsive release of anticancer drugs in tumors. The drug conjugation has maintained the bacterial motion profiles of over 9 μm/s and cell viability of over 70%. After 3 h and 3 days of intravenous injection of EcN-ca-Dox, DOX accumulations in tumors are determined as 12.9% and 6.4% of the injected doses per gram of tissue, respectively, which are much higher than the commonly used nanocarriers. Compared with free DOX and DOX-conjugated EcN via stable linkers of succinic anhydride, the EcN-ca-Dox treatment improves the antitumor efficacy with respect to the tumor growth inhibition, prolongation of animal survivals, and apoptosis induction of tumor cells. In addition, EcN has been cleaned off from tumors and other tissues after antimicrobial treatment.

Here, we examined the role of GOLM1 in the development of human glioma. Methods: qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and western blot analysis were performed to evaluate GOLM1 levels in cell lines and a cohort of primary human glioma and non-neoplastic brain tissue samples. Glioma cell lines were modified with lentiviral constructs expressing short hairpin RNAs targeting GOLM1 or overexpressing the protein to assess function in proliferation, viability, and migration and invasion in vitro using EdU, CCK8, clone-forming, Transwell assays, 3D tumor spheroid invasion assay and in vivo in orthotopic implantations. Protein lysates were used to screen a membrane-based antibody array to identify kinases mediated by GOLM1. Specific inhibitors of PDGFRα (AG1296) and AKT (MK-2206) were used to examine the regulation of PDGFA/PDGFRα on GOLM1 and the underlying pathway respectively. Results: qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis revealed GOLM1 expression to be elevated in glioma tissues and cell lines. Silencing of GOLM1 attenuated proliferation, migration, and invasion of U251, A172 and P3#GBM (primary glioma) cells, while overexpression of GOLM1 enhanced malignant behavior of U87MG cells. We further demonstrated that activation of AKT is the driving force of GOLM1-promoted glioma progression. The last finding of this research belongs to the regulation of PDGFA/PDGFRα on GOLM1, while GOLM1 was also a key element of PDGFA/PDGFRα-mediated activation of AKT, as well as the progression of glioma cells. Conclusions: PDGFA/PDGFRα-regulated GOLM1 promotes glioma progression possibly through activation of a key signaling kinase, AKT. GOLM1 interference may therefore provide a novel therapeutic target and improve the efficacy of glioma treatment, particularly in the case of the proneural molecular subtype of human glioma. © 2017 The Author(s).","AKT; Glioma; GOLM1; PDGFA; Progression",Article,Scopus

METHODS In this multicenter, phase 2 trial, we enrolled 111 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, or transformed follicular lymphoma who had refractory disease despite undergoing recommended prior therapy. Patients received a target dose of 2×106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells per kilogram of body weight after receiving a conditioning regimen of low-dose cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. The primary end point was the rate of objective response (calculated as the combined rates of complete response and partial response). Secondary end points included overall survival, safety, and biomarker assessments. RESULTS Among the 111 patients who were enrolled, axi-cel was successfully manufactured for 110 (99%) and administered to 101 (91%). The objective response rate was 82%, and the complete response rate was 54%.With a median follow-up of 15.4 months, 42% of the patients continued to have a response, with 40% continuing to have a complete response. The overall rate of survival at 18 months was 52%. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher during treatment were neutropenia (in 78% of the patients), anemia (in 43%), and thrombocytopenia (in 38%). Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome and neurologic events occurred in 13% and 28% of the patients, respectively. Three of the patients died during treatment. Higher CAR T-cell levels in blood were associated with response. CONCLUSIONS In this multicenter study, patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma who received CAR T-cell therapy with axi-cel had high levels of durable response, with a safety profile that included myelosuppression, the cytokine release syndrome, and neurologic events. © 2017 Massachusetts Medical Society.",,Article,Scopus

Methods: The workflow of this study follows Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines of a systematic review of diagnostic test accuracy studies. An electronic search was performed for clinical diagnostic studies directly comparing 18F-FAMT and 18F-FDG PET for malignant tumors. Study quality, the risks of bias and sources of variation among studies were assessed using the QUADAS (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) assessment tool.

The downstream signaling targets of BMP4 in HCC were profiled and confirmed. Results BMP4 expression was significantly increased in HCC tissue, and was correlated with tumor de-differentiation and unfavorable prognosis. BMP4 promoted HCC EMT and was correlated with OXA resistance. Blocking of BMP4 reversed EMT and increased OXA chemosensitivity in vitro and in vivo.

METHODS The growth inhibition of Hep-G2 cells was detected by CCK-8 method. Effect of VK 2 on cell apoptosis and proliferation was checked by flow cytometry. The expressions of BTG2 and Cyclin D1 protein were tested by Western blot,the transcription levels of BTG2 and Cyclin D1 mRNAs were checked by RT-PCR. RESULTS With the increase of concentration(40,80,160 μmol/L),the proliferations of Hep-G2 cells were inhibited in a dose and time dependent manner,and IC 50 value was 65.17 μmol/L after drug intervention for 48 hours. The results of flow cytometry showed that the cells proportion of G 1 phase in the experimental group (55±1.0)% was significantly higher than that of the control group (44±1.0)%,and the difference was statistically significant (P=0.000 3),which illustrated that VK 2 could block the cell cycle to G 1 phase. In addition,the results of apoptosis measured by flow cytometry showed that the apoptosis rate in the middle and late stage of the experiment group was significantly different from that in the control group (F=275.6,P&lt;0.05). In addition,the rate of apoptosis was correlated positively with time (F=693.3,P&lt;0.01).Western blot results showed that with the treating time protracting,the expression of BTG2 was 0.138±0.001,0.258±0.013,0.330±0.007 respectively at 24,48 and 72 h,which showed an upward trend,and the difference was significant (F=993.7,P&lt;0.01) when compared with the control group (0.021±0.001),while the expression of Cyclin D1 protein was 0.411±0.002,0.372±0.005,0.232±0.006 at the same time,which decreased gradually,in addation,compared to the control group (0.733±0.032) the difference was statistically significant (F=489.7,P&lt;0.01). RT-PCR indicated that the expressions of BTG2 mRNA was 1.13±0.46,1.15±0.03,1.22±0.37 at 24,48 and 72 h,which indicated that the variation trend of upregulation was not obvious with the extension of time (P&gt;0.05).Compared with the control group (1.00±0.00),the difference was not clear in the light of statistics (F=0.30,P=0.83). However,the expressions of Cyclin D1 mRNA in the three period of time was 0.63±0.03,0.44±0.05,0.14±0.03,which showed that VK 2 could downgradulate the expression of Cyclin D1 mRNA,and the difference was statistically significant (F=415.6,P&lt;0.01) comparing to the control group (1.00±0.00). CONCLUSIONS VK 2 could inhibit the proliferation of Hep-G2 cells and induce apoptosis,and the mechanisim may be related to the upregulation of BTG2 and downregulation of Cyclin D1 by VK 2 .This provides a new basis for VK 2 as a natural medicine for the treatment of liver cancer. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

Previous studies reported that TP53 mutations correlated with poor prognoses in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, the relationship between TP53 mutations and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPSCC) is not known. The current study aimed to evaluate TP53 mutation status as a predictive biomarker in patients with HPSCC. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical charts of 57 HPSCC patients treated with initial surgery between 2008 and 2014. TP53 mutation status was determined by Sanger sequencing, and patients were classified into wild-type, missense mutation, and truncating mutation groups. Additionally, p53 expression was determined using immunohistochemistry in surgical specimens. Results: TP53 mutations were identified in 39 (68%) patients. The 3-year disease-specific survival (DSS) rate of wild-type, missense mutation, and truncating mutation group were 94%, 61%, and 43%, respectively. The TP53 mutation group displayed significantly worse DSS and overall survival rates than the wild-type group (P = 0.01 and P = 0.007, respectively). Multivariate analyses revealed that the presence of TP53 mutations and ≥4 metastatic lymph nodes were independent adverse prognostic factors for HPSCC. p53 immunopositivity was detected in 22 patients, including 5 (28%) and 17 (71%) patients in the wild-type and missense mutation groups, whereas none of the patients with truncating mutation exhibited p53 immunopositivity (P = 0.0001). Conclusion: The TP53 mutation status correlated with poor prognosis in surgically treated HPSCC patients. Specifically, truncating mutations which were not detected by p53 immunohistochemistry were predictive of worst survival. © 2017 The Author(s).","Hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma; Pharyngectomy; Prognosis; TP53 mutation; Truncating mutation",Article,Scopus

Methods: This observational study evaluated the implementation of ERP in gynaecologic oncological surgery in a minimally invasive techniques (MIT) expert center with more than 85% of procedures done with MIT. We compared a prospective cohort of 100 patients involved in ERP between December 2015 and June 2016 to a 100 patients control group, without ERP, previously managed in the same center between April 2015 and November 2015. All the included patients were referred for hysterectomy and/or pelvic or para-aortic lymphadenectomy for gynaecological cancer. The primary objective was to achieve a significant decrease of median LOS in the ERP group. Secondary objectives were decreases in proportion of patients achieving target LOS (2 days), morbidity and readmissions. Results: Except a disparity in oncological indications with a higher proportion of endometrial cancer in the group with ERP vs. the group without ERP (42% vs. 22%; p = 0.003), there were no differences in patient's characteristics and surgical procedures. ERP were associated with decreases of median LOS (2.5 [0 to 11] days vs. 3 [1 to 14] days; p = 0.002) and proportion of discharged patient at target LOS (45% vs. 24%; p = 0.002). Morbidities occurred in 25% and 26% in the groups with and without ERP and readmission rates were respectively of 6% and 8%, without any significant difference. Conclusion: ERP in gynaecologic oncological surgery is associated with a decrease of LOS without increases of morbidity or readmission rates, even in a center with a high proportion of MIT. Although it is already widely accepted that MIT improves early recovery, our study shows that the addition of ERP's clinical pathways improve surgical outcomes and patient care management. © 2017 The Author(s).","Enhanced recovery after surgery; Fast-track programs; Gynaecological oncology surgery; Medical care enhancement; Minimally invasive techniques",Article,Scopus

However, TKI are not yet curative, because most patients retain leukemic stem cells (LSC) and their progenitors in bone marrow and relapse following treatment cessation. At diagnosis, deregulation of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway is involved in LSC and progenitor expansion. Here, we report that BMP pathway alterations persist in TKI-resistant patients. In comparison with patients in complete cytogenetic remission, TKI-resistant LSC and progenitors display high levels of BMPR1b expression and alterations of its cellular localization. In vitro treatment of immature chronic phase CML cells with TKI alone, or in combination with interferon-a, results in the preferential survival of BMPR1b1 cells.Wedemonstrated persistent and increasingBMP4production by patients' mesenchymal cells with resistance. Patient follow-up revealed an increase of BMPR1b expression and in BMP4 expression in LSC from TKI-resistant patients in comparison with diagnosis, while remaining unchanged in sensitive patients. Both leukemic and nonleukemic cells exhibit higher BMP4 levels in the bone marrow of TKIresistant patients. Exposure to BMP2/BMP4 does not alter BCR-ABL transcript expression but is accompanied by the overexpression of TWIST-1, a transcription factor highly expressed in resistant LSC. By modulating BMP4 or BMPR1b expression, we show that these elements are involved in TKI resistance. In summary, we reveal that persistence of BMP alterations and existence of an autocrine loop promote CML-primitive cells' TKI resistance. © 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.",,Article,Scopus

If knowledge concerning the feature-label distribution - for instance, genetic pathways - is available, then it can be used in learning. Optimal Bayesian classification provides optimal classification under model uncertainty. It differs from classical Bayesian methods in which a classification model is assumed and prior distributions are placed on model parameters. With optimal Bayesian classification, uncertainty is treated directly on the feature-label distribution, which assures full utilization of prior knowledge and is guaranteed to outperform classical methods. Results: The salient problem confronting optimal Bayesian classification is prior construction. In this paper, we propose a new prior construction methodology based on a general framework of constraints in the form of conditional probability statements. We call this prior the maximal knowledge-driven information prior (MKDIP). The new constraint framework is more flexible than our previous methods as it naturally handles the potential inconsistency in archived regulatory relationships and conditioning can be augmented by other knowledge, such as population statistics. We also extend the application of prior construction to a multinomial mixture model when labels are unknown, which often occurs in practice. The performance of the proposed methods is examined on two important pathway families, the mammalian cell-cycle and a set of p53-related pathways, and also on a publicly available gene expression dataset of non-small cell lung cancer when combined with the existing prior knowledge on relevant signaling pathways. Conclusion: The new proposed general prior construction framework extends the prior construction methodology to a more flexible framework that results in better inference when proper prior knowledge exists. Moreover, the extension of optimal Bayesian classification to multinomial mixtures where data sets are both small and unlabeled, enables superior classifier design using small, unstructured data sets. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach using pathway information and available knowledge of gene regulating functions; however, the underlying theory can be applied to a wide variety of knowledge types, and other applications when there are small samples. © 2017 The Author(s).","Biological pathways; Optimal Bayesian classification; Prior construction; Probabilistic Boolean networks",Article,Scopus

The mitotic spindle plays a pivotal role in chromosome alignment and segregation during metaphase and anaphase. Structural or functional errors of this spindle can cause aneuploidy, a hallmark of many cancers. To investigate if a given protein associates with the mitotic spindle and regulates its assembly, stability, or function, fluorescence microscopy can be performed to determine if disruption of that protein induces phenotypes indicative of spindle dysfunction. Importantly, functional disruption of proteins with specific roles during mitosis can lead to cancer cell death by inducing mitotic insult. However, there is a lack of automated computational tools to detect and quantify the effects of such disruption on spindle integrity. Results: We developed the image analysis software tool MatQuantify, which detects both large-scale and subtle structural changes in the spindle or DNA and can be used to statistically compare the effects of different treatments. MatQuantify can quantify various physical properties extracted from fluorescence microscopy images, such as area, lengths of various components, perimeter, eccentricity, fractal dimension, satellite objects and orientation. It can also measure textual properties including entropy, intensities and the standard deviation of intensities. Using MatQuantify, we studied the effect of knocking down the protein clathrin heavy chain (CHC) on the mitotic spindle. We analysed 217 microscopy images of untreated metaphase cells, 172 images of metaphase cells transfected with small interfering RNAs targeting the luciferase gene (as a negative control), and 230 images of metaphase cells depleted of CHC. Using the quantified data, we trained 23 supervised machine learning classification algorithms. The Support Vector Machine learning algorithm was the most accurate method (accuracy: 85.1%; area under the curve: 0.92) for classifying a spindle image. The Kruskal-Wallis and Tukey-Kramer tests demonstrated that solidity, compactness, eccentricity, extent, mean intensity and number of satellite objects (multipolar spindles) significantly differed between CHC-depleted cells and untreated/luciferase-knockdown cells. Conclusion: MatQuantify enables automated quantitative analysis of images of mitotic spindles. Using this tool, researchers can unambiguously test if disruption of a protein-of-interest changes metaphase spindle maintenance and thereby affects mitosis. © 2017 The Author(s).","Automated classification; Image analysis software; Image processing; Mitosis; Mitotic spindle",Article,Scopus

METHODS We retrospectively studied consecutive patients who underwent LT between January 1998 to April 2016. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained from patient medical records. Imaging findings on computed tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography were reviewed by two radiologists. RESULTS During the study period, 872 patients underwent cadaveric LT. Pancreatic cysts were identified in 53/872 (6.1%) and 31/53 (58.5%) were PCNs [28 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), 2 mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN), 1 serous cystadenoma]. Patients with PCNs exhibited less male predominance (55% vs 73%, P = 0.03) compared to patients without pancreatic cysts. Thirteen patients (42%) were diagnosed with PCN pre-LT while 18 patients (58%) developed PCN post-LT. The median size of PCNs was 13mm [interquartile range (IQR) 10-20 mm]. All IPMNs were side-branch type. Most PCNs were found in the head and body of pancreas (37% each), followed by the tail (25%). Five patients underwent further evaluation with endoscopic ultrasound. Progress imaging was performed on 81% of patients. PCNs remained stable in size and number in all but 2 patients. During a median follow up of 39 mo (IQR 26-58 mo), the 2 (6%) patients with MCN underwent pancreatectomy. No PCN patient developed pancreatic adenocarcinoma, while 5 died from illnesses unrelated to the PCN. Among patients without PCN, 1/841 (0.1%) developed pancreatic adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSION The prevalence of PCNs in LT recipients was similar to the general population (3.6%, 31/872). Side-branch IPMNs do not appear to have accelerated malignant potential in post-LT patients, indicating the current surveillance guidelines are applicable to this group. © The Author(s) 2017.

The discovery of novel drug-disease interactions, on one hand can help to find novel indictions for the approved drugs; on the other hand can provide new therapeutic approaches for the diseases. Recently, computational methods for finding drug-disease interactions have attracted lots of attention because of their far more higher efficiency and lower cost than the traditional wet experiment methods. However, they still face several challenges, such as the organization of the heterogeneous data, the performance of the model, and so on. Methods: In this work, we present to hierarchically integrate the heterogeneous data into three layers. The drug-drug and disease-disease similarities are first calculated separately in each layer, and then the similarities from three layers are linearly fused into comprehensive drug similarities and disease similarities, which can then be used to measure the similarities between two drug-disease pairs. We construct a novel weighted drug-disease pair network, where a node is a drug-disease pair with known or unknown treatment relation, an edge represents the node-node relation which is weighted with the similarity score between two pairs. Now that similar drug-disease pairs are supposed to show similar treatment patterns, we can find the optimal graph cut of the network. The drug-disease pair with unknown relation can then be considered to have similar treatment relation with that within the same cut. Therefore, we develop a semi-supervised graph cut algorithm, SSGC, to find the optimal graph cut, based on which we can identify the potential drug-disease treatment interactions. Results: By comparing with three representative network-based methods, SSGC achieves the highest performances, in terms of both AUC score and the identification rates of true drug-disease pairs. The experiments with different integration strategies also demonstrate that considering several sources of data can improve the performances of the predictors. Further case studies on four diseases, the top-ranked drug-disease associations have been confirmed by KEGG, CTD database and the literature, illustrating the usefulness of SSGC. Conclusions: The proposed comprehensive similarity scores from multi-views and multiple layers and the graph-cut based algorithm can greatly improve the prediction performances of drug-disease associations. © 2017 The Author(s).","Drug-disease interaction; Graph cut; Guilt-by-association; Integration strategy; Similarity",Article,Scopus

While PKA is a tumour promoter, PKC isozymes act as tumour promoters or suppressors, depending on the cancer type. In particular, PKCε is frequently implicated in cancer promotion, making it a potential target for anticancer drugs. To improve isozyme selectivity of balanol, exhaustive structural and activity relationship (SAR) studies have been performed in the last two decades, but with limited success. More recently, fluorination on balanol has shown improved selectivity for PKCε, although the fluorine effect is not yet clearly understood. Understanding the origin to this fluorine-based selectivity will be valuable for designing better balanol-based ATP mimicking inhibitors. Computational approaches such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can decipher the fluorine effect, provided that correct charges have been assigned to a ligand. Balanol analogues have multiple ionisable functional groups and the effect of fluorine substitutions on the exact charge state of each analogue bound to PKA and to PKCε needs to be thoroughly investigated in order to design highly selective inhibitors for therapeutic applications. Results: We explored the charge states of novel fluorinated balanol analogues using MD simulations. For different potential charge states of these analogues, Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MMGBSA) binding energy values were computed. This study suggests that balanol and the most potent fluorinated analogue (5S fluorine substitution on the azepane ring), have charges on the azepane ring (N1), and the phenolic (C6''OH) and the carboxylate (C15''O2H) groups on the benzophenone moiety, when bound to PKCε as well as PKA. Conclusions: To the best our knowledge, this is the first study showing that the phenolate group is charged in balanol and its analogues binding to the ATP site of PKCε. Correct charge assignments of ligands are important to obtain predicted binding energy values from MD simulations that reflect experimental values. Both fluorination and the local enzymatic environment of the ATP site can influence the exact charge states of balanol analogues. Overall, this study is highly valuable for further rational design of potent balanol analogues selective to PKCε. © 2017 The Author(s).","ATP mimic; Kinase inhibitors; Ligand charge state; Molecular dynamics simulation; Molecular modelling",Article,Scopus

The cervical cell recognition was treated as a 4-class classification problem. There were two levels in this hierarchical method. First, one-versus-one strategy was used to train 6 SVM (support vector machine) classifiers to do a 3-class classification. Second, abnormal cells in one type of 3 categories were classified by a 2-class SVM. To optimize the feature combination and reduce the running time, a feature transformation method named PCA was adopted to transform the original feature vector into low-dimension feature space. The experiments show that the proposed hierarchical PCA recognition method is faster than the common hierarchical method at a ratio of 21.31%, and can distinguish 4 cervical cell categories better than 6 other traditional methods and achieve above 90% accuracy. © 2017, NUDT Press.

These reports are based on the results of animal experiments and human based studies. Although, the exact delineated mechanism is not yet established, there are evidences available to emphasize the involvement of HCV induced chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, endoplasmic reticulum stress, hepato steatosis and liver fibrosis in the progression of HCV chronic disease to HCC. Persistent infection with replicating HCV not only initiates several liver alterations but also creates an environment for development of liver cancer. Various studies have reported that HCV acts both directly as well as indirectly in promoting this process. Whereas HCV related proteins, like HCV core, E1, E2, NS3 and NS5A, modulate signal pathways dysregulating cell cycle and cell metabolism, the chronic infection produces similar changes in an indirect way. HCV is an RNA virus and does not integrate with host genome and therefore, HCV induced hepatocarcinogenesis pursues a totally different mechanism causing imbalance between suppressors and proto-oncogenes and genomic integrity.

High response rates have been reported with the use of T cells modified by chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that target CD19 in B-cell cancers, although data regarding B-cell lymphomas are limited. METHODS We used autologous T cells that express a CD19-directed CAR (CTL019) to treat patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or follicular lymphoma that had relapsed or was refractory to previous treatments. Patients were monitored for response to treatment, toxic effects, the expansion and persistence of CTL019 cells in vivo, and immune recovery. RESULTS A total of 28 adult patients with lymphoma received CTL019 cells, and 18 of 28 had a response (64%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 44 to 81). Complete remission occurred in 6 of 14 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (43%; 95% CI, 18 to 71) and 10 of 14 patients with follicular lymphoma (71%; 95% CI, 42 to 92).

All patients in complete remission by 6 months remained in remission at 7.7 to 37.9 months (median, 29.3 months) after induction, with a sustained reappearance of B cells in 8 of 16 patients and with improvement in levels of IgG in 4 of 10 patients and of IgM in 6 of 10 patients at 6 months or later and in levels of IgA in 3 of 10 patients at 18 months or later. CONCLUSIONS CTL019 cells can be effective in the treatment of relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. High rates of durable remission were observed, with recovery of B cells and immunoglobulins in some patients. Transient encephalopathy developed in approximately one in three patients and severe cytokine-release syndrome developed in one in five patients. © 2017 Massachusetts Medical Society.",,Article,Scopus

However, its considerable side effects and the emergence of drug resistance are becoming major limitations for its application. This study aimed to investigate whether matrine and cisplatin could present a synergistic anti-tumor effect on UBC cells. Methods: Cell viability assay was used to assess the suppressive effect of matrine and cisplatin on the proliferation of the UBC cells. Wound healing assay and transwell assay were applied respectively to determine the migration and invasion ability of the cells. The distribution of cell cycles, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the apoptosis rate were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). The expressions of the relative proteins in apoptotic signal pathways and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related genes were surveyed by western blotting. The binding modes of the drugs within the proteins were detected by CDOCKER module in DS 2.5. Results: Both matrine and cisplatin could inhibit the growth of the UBC cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. When matrine combined with cisplatin at the ratio of 2000:1, they presented a synergistic inhibitory effect on the UBC cells. The combinative treatment could impair cell migration and invasion ability, arrest cell cycle in the G1 and S phases, increase the level of ROS, and induce apoptosis in EJ and T24 cells in a synergistic way. In all the treated groups, the expressions of E-cadherin, β-catenin, Bax, and Cleaved Caspase-3 were up-regulated, while the expressions of Fibronectin, Vimentin, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, p-Akt, p-PI3K, VEGFR2, and VEGF proteins were down-regulated, and among them, the combination of matrine and cisplatin showed the most significant difference. Molecular docking algorithms predicted that matrine and cisplatin could be docked into the same active sites and interact with different residues within the tested proteins. Conclusions: Our results suggested that the combination of matrine and cisplatin could synergistically inhibit the UBC cells' proliferation through down-regulating VEGF/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, indicating that matrine may serve as a new option in the combinative therapy in the treatment of UBC. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cisplatin; Combination; EJ; Matrine; Synergistic effect; T24; VEGF/PI3K/Akt signal pathway",Article,Scopus

This approach results in the fabrication of Fe/FeCaP heterostructured microspheres that exhibit superparamagnetism with a saturation magnetization of 10.77 emu g-1. The Fe/FeCaP particles annealed at 600 °C show a much higher magnetic moment compared with the non-annealed FeCaP particles. Moreover, T2-weighted MRI phantom images reveal that the Fe/FeCaP heterostructured microspheres possess higher relaxivity than paramagnetic FeCaP, demonstrating their potential as superior and biocompatible MRI contrast agents. Moreover, the enhancement in osteoconductivity for Fe/FeCaP microspheres without any evidence of cytotoxicity was verified.

It has been used to identify differential co-expression networks or interactomes. Many algorithms have been developed for single-factor differential co-expression analysis and applied in a variety of studies. However, in many studies, the samples are characterized by multiple factors such as genetic markers, clinical variables and treatments. No algorithm or methodology is available for multi-factor analysis of differential co-expression. Results: We developed a novel formulation and a computationally efficient greedy search algorithm called MultiDCoX to perform multi-factor differential co-expression analysis.

MultiDCoX analysis of a breast cancer dataset identified interesting biologically meaningful differentially co-expressed (DCX) gene sets along with genetic and clinical factors that influenced the respective differential co-expression.

With this data increasing in a daily basis, the design and development of efficient and accurate statistical methods has become absolutely necessary. Specific analyses, such as those related to genome-wide association studies and multi-omics information, are often aimed at clustering sub-conditions of cancers and other diseases. Hierarchical clustering methods, which can be categorized into agglomerative and divisive, have been widely used in such situations. However, unlike agglomerative methods divisive clustering approaches have consistently proved to be computationally expensive. Results: The proposed clustering algorithm (DRAGON) was verified on mutation and microarray data, and was gauged against standard clustering methods in the literature. Its validation included synthetic and significant biological data. When validated on mixed-lineage leukemia data, DRAGON achieved the highest clustering accuracy with data of four different dimensions. Consequently, DRAGON outperformed previous methods with 3-,4- and 5-dimensional acute leukemia data. When tested on mutation data, DRAGON achieved the best performance with 2-dimensional information.

Identifying potential microbe-disease associations, which could provide better understanding of disease pathology and further boost disease diagnostic and prognostic, has attracted more and more attention. However, hardly any computational models have been developed for large scale microbe-disease association prediction. Results: In this article, based on the assumption that microbes with similar functions tend to share similar association or non-association patterns with similar diseases and vice versa, we proposed the model of Network Consistency Projection for Human Microbe-Disease Association prediction (NCPHMDA) by integrating known microbe-disease associations and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity for microbes and diseases. NCPHMDA yielded outstanding AUCs of 0.9039, 0.7953 and average AUC of 0.8918 in global leave-one-out cross validation, local leave-one-out cross validation and 5-fold cross validation, respectively. Furthermore, colon cancer, asthma and type 2 diabetes were taken as independent case studies, where 9, 9 and 8 out of the top 10 predicted microbes were successfully confirmed by recent published clinical literature. Conclusion: NCPHMDA is a non-parametric universal network-based method which can simultaneously predict associated microbes for investigated diseases but does not require negative samples.

Many surgical techniques have been proposed. This report shows another fibular reconstructive option with promising outcome. Case presentation: We report the case of a 30-year-old woman who presented with a solitary mass located in the lateral aspect of the ankle. The mass had grown rapidly for 2 months and caused increasing pain. Physical examination showed a 3.0 cm diameter tender, nonmobile hard mass in the lateral malleolus. Radiographs showed an osteolytic lesion involving the lateral cortex at the distal fibula. After incisional biopsy, pathologic examination found a well-differentiated intramedullary osteosarcoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin was provided for 3 months prior to definitive surgical treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging showed persistent tumor in the biopsy site. After distal fibulectomy and wide resection, split tibialis posterior tendon transfer to the remaining peroneus brevis restored the stability of the ankle. The pain resolved within 3 months. The ankle was stable and no recurrence of the cancer was found at a 7 year follow-up.

The piRNAs play an important role in protecting the genome from invasive transposons in the germline. Recent studies have shown that piRNAs are linked to the genome stability and a variety of human cancers. Due to their clinical importance, there is a pressing need for effective computational methods that can be used for computational identification of piRNAs. However, piRNAs lack conserved structural motifs and show relatively low sequence similarity across different species, which makes accurate computational prediction of piRNAs challenging. Results: In this paper, we propose a novel method, piRNAdetect, for reliable computational prediction of piRNAs in genome sequences. In the proposed method, we first classify piRNA sequences in the training dataset that share similar sequence motifs and extract effective predictive features through the use of n-gram models (NGMs). The extracted NGM-based features are then used to construct a support vector machine that can be used for accurate prediction of novel piRNAs. Conclusions: We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed piRNAdetect algorithm through extensive performance evaluation based on piRNAs in three different species - H. sapiens, R. norvegicus, and M. musculus - obtained from the piRBase and show that piRNAdetect outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy. © 2017 The Author(s).","N-gram model (NGM); PiRNA prediction; Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA); Support vector machine (SVM)",Article,Scopus

Most microRNA assays use an amplification strategy to obtain high sensitivity, which makes them complicated. Herein, we present a simple and amplification-free solid-state electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor for the detection of miRNA based on high effective quenching by ferrocene and using N-butyldiethanolamine (BDEA) as a more effective co-reactant. Initially, the mixture of Nafion and Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) was cast onto the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to form a Nafion-AuNPs film. The resulting electrode was then immersed into a solution of Ru(bpy)3 2+, where the solid-state Nafion-AuNPs/Ru(bpy)3 2+ could be obtained via electrostatic adsorption. The DNA molecular beacon, which was modified with thiol at one distal and the other was labeled with ferrocene (i.e., Fc-MB), was covalently attached to AuNPs on the ECL film through a Au-S bond. Afterwards, the remaining active sites of nonspecific adsorption were blocked with 6-mercapto-1-hexanol (MCH). When the target miRNA was present, it hybridized with the complementary part in the loop of Fc-MB and formed a double-stranded structure. This conformational change led the quencher away from the electrode, resulting in a remarkable increase in ECL intensity. Under the optimum condition, the ECL signal had a linear relationship with miRNA concentration ranging from 0.01 pM to 1 × 103 pM, with a limit of detection of 10 fM. Moreover, our biosensor showed remarkable specificity, outstanding reproducibility, good stability and excellent performance in real sample investigation with no amplification. Therefore, this developed strategy has great potential in early miRNA-related cancer diagnosis. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Article,Scopus

These moderated sampling probabilities are, inspired by empirical Bayes, learned from the data at hand. We demonstrate the co-data moderated Random Forest (CoRF) with two examples.

We demonstrate how a set of external p-values, a gene signature, and the correlation between gene expression and DNA copy number can improve the predictive performance.

The introduction of a protocol of immunization, with Gardasil and Cervarix vaccines, has radically changed the way this infection easily spreads among people. Even though vaccination is only preventive and not therapeutic, it is a strong tool capable to avoid the consequences that this pathogen could cause. Gardasil vaccine is not free from side effects and the duration of immunity is not always well determined. This work aim to enhance the effects of the vaccination by using a new class of adjuvants and a different administration protocol. Due to their minimum side effects, their easy extraction, their low production costs and their proven immune stimulating activity, citrus-derived molecules are valid candidates to be administered as adjuvants in a vaccine formulation against Hpv. Results: With the aim to get a stronger immune response against Hpv infection we built an in silico model that delivers a way to predict the best adjuvants and the optimal means of administration to obtain such a goal. Simulations envisaged that the use of Neohesperidin elicited a strong immune response that was then validated in vivo. Conclusions: We built up a computational infrastructure made by a virtual screening approach able to preselect promising citrus derived compounds, and by an agent based model that reproduces HPV dynamics subject to vaccine stimulation. This integrated methodology was able to predict the best protocol that confers a very good immune response against HPV infection. We finally tested the in silico results through in vivo experiments on mice, finding good agreement. © 2017 The Author(s).","Adjuvants; HPV; Multi agent systems, vaccines; Virtual screening",Article,Scopus

Unsupervised clustering of patient information can reveal distinct phenotype groups with different underlying mechanism, risk prognosis and treatment response. However, biological datasets are usually characterized by a combination of low sample number and very high dimensionality, something that is not adequately addressed by current algorithms. While the performance of the methods is satisfactory for low dimensional data, increasing number of features results in either deterioration of accuracy or inability to cluster. To tackle these challenges, new methodologies designed specifically for such data are needed. Results: We present 2D-EM, a clustering algorithm approach designed for small sample size and high-dimensional datasets. To employ information corresponding to data distribution and facilitate visualization, the sample is folded into its two-dimension (2D) matrix form (or feature matrix). The maximum likelihood estimate is then estimated using a modified expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The 2D-EM methodology was benchmarked against several existing clustering methods using 6 medically-relevant transcriptome datasets. The percentage improvement of Rand score and adjusted Rand index compared to the best performing alternative method is up to 21.9% and 155.6%, respectively. To present the general utility of the 2D-EM method we also employed 2 methylome datasets, again showing superior performance relative to established methods. Conclusions: The 2D-EM algorithm was able to reproduce the groups in transcriptome and methylome data with high accuracy. This build confidence in the methods ability to uncover novel disease subtypes in new datasets.

The incidence and mortality of this liver tumor are increasing in most areas of the world as a consequence of aging and the emerging of new risk factors such as the metabolic syndrome, beside the recognized role of hepatitis B and C viral infections and alcohol abuse. Despite the increasing knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatic carcinogenesis, effective therapeutic strategies are still an unmet clinical need. Efforts have been made to develop selective drugs as well as effective targeted drug delivery systems. The development of novel drug carriers for therapeutic molecules can indeed offer a valuable strategy to ameliorate the efficacy of HCC treatment. In this review, we discuss recent drug delivery strategies for HCC treatment based on the exploitation of targeted nanoparticles (NPs). Indeed, a few of these platforms have achieved an advanced stage of preclinical development. Here, we review the most promising drug nanovehicles based on both synthetic and natural polymers, including polysaccharides that have emerged for their biocompatibility and biodegradability. To maximize site-selectivity and therapeutic efficacy, drug delivery systems should be functionalized with ligands which can specifically recognize and bind targets expressed by HCC, namely cell membrane associated antigens, receptors or biotransporters. Cell surface and intracellular molecular targets are exploited either to selectively deliver drug-loaded nanovehicles or to design novel selective therapeutics. In conclusion, the combination of novel and safe drug delivery strategies based on site-specific targeted drug nanovehicles with therapeutic molecular targets may significantly improve the pharmacological efficacy for the treatment of HCC. © 2017","DNA damage; Drug delivery systems; Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA); Mitotic checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2); Molecular targets; Polymer therapeutics; SerpinB3",Review,Scopus

The aim of this study was to explore the efficacy of PCI-based delivery of bleomycin and the impact on systemic anti-tumor immunity. Mouse colon carcinoma cells (CT26.CL25), stably expressing the bacterial β-galactosidase, were inoculated into the legs of athymic or immuno-competent BALB/c mice strains. The mice were injected with the photosensitizer AlPcS2a and bleomycin (BLM) prior to tumor light exposure from a 670 nm diode laser. Photochemical activation of BLM was found to induce synergistic inhibition of tumor growth as compared to the sum of the individual treatments. However, a curative effect was not observed in the athymic mice exposed to 30 J/cm2 of light while &gt; 90% of the thymic mice were cured after exposure to only 15 J/cm2 light. Cured thymic mice, re-challenged with CT26.CL25 tumor cells on the contralateral leg, rejected 57–100% of the tumor cells inoculated immediately and up to 2 months after the photochemical treatment. T-cells from the spleen of PCI-treated mice were found to inhibit the growth of CT26.CL25 cells in naïve thymic mice with a 60% rejection rate. The results show that treatment of CT26.CL25 tumors in thymic mice by PCI of BLM induces a systemic anti-tumor immunity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anti-tumor immunity; Bleomycin; Photochemical internalization; Photodynamic",Article,Scopus

METHODS Ninety patients with chemotherapy-associated diarrhea treated at Taizhou Municipal Hospital from January 2015 to December 2016 were randomly divided into a control group (n = 45) and an observation group (n = 45). Both groups were given montmorillonite powder-based conventional symptomatic treatment, and the observation group was additionally given Bifidobacterium triple viable capsules. Clinical efficacy, intestinal mucosal barrier function, inflammatory cytokine levels, and intestinal flora were compared between the two groups. RESULTS In the observation group, 25 (55.56%) cases showed marked improvement and 17 (37.78%) cases showed improvement, with a total effective rate of 93.33%, which was significantly higher than that in the control group (75.56%; P < 0.05). Before treatment, intestinal mucosal barrier function indexes were similar between the two groups (P > 0.05); after treatment, diamine oxidase, D-lactic acid, and endothelin were significantly decreased in both groups, and the decrease was significantly more remarkable in the observation group (P < 0.05). Before treatment, inflammatory cytokines in the two groups were similar (P > 0.05); after treatment, tumor necrosis factor-α, procalcitonin, and interleukin-6 were significantly decreased in both groups, and the decrease was significantly more remarkable in the observation group (P < 0.05). The number of intestinal microbes after treatment was significantly lower than that before treatment in the control group. In the observation group, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus were significantly increased after treatment, and the number of intestinal microbes was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, and Escherichia coli showed no significant changes between before and after treatment in the observation group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION Auxiliary application of probiotics can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy for chemotherapyinduced diarrhea in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines, improve intestinal mucosal barrier function, regulate the balance of intestinal flora disturbance, and reconstruct intestinal ecological balance. © The Author(s) 2017.","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia; Bifidobacterium; Chemotherapy-associated diarrhea; Intestinal mucosal barrier function",Article,Scopus

In this study, we redirected the specificity of T cells to SLAMF7 through expression of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) derived from the huLuc63 antibody (elotuzumab) and demonstrate that SLAMF7-CAR T cells prepared from patients and healthy donors confer potent antimyeloma reactivity. We confirmed uniform, high-level expression ofSLAMF7on malignant plasma cells in previously untreated and in relapsed/ refractory (R/R) myeloma patients who had received previous treatment with proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs. Consequently, SLAMF7-CAR T cells conferred rapid cytolysis of previously untreatedandR/R primarymyeloma cells in vitro. In addition, a single administration of SLAMF7-CAR T cells led to resolution of medullary and extramedullary myeloma manifestations in a murine xenograft model in vivo. SLAMF7 is expressed on a fraction of normal lymphocytes, including subsets of natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, andBcells. After modification with theSLAMF7-CAR, bothCD81 andCD41 T cells rapidly acquired and maintained a SLAMF7- phenotype and could be readily expanded to therapeutically relevant cell doses. We analyzed the recognition of normal lymphocytes by SLAMF7-CAR T cells and show that they induce selective fratricide of SLAMF7+/high NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and B cells. Importantly, however, the fratricide conferred by SLAMF7-CAR T cells spares the SLAMF7-/low fraction in each cell subset and preserves functional lymphocytes, including virus-specific T cells. In aggregate, our data illustrate the potential use of SLAMF7-CAR T-cell therapy as an effective treatment against multiple myeloma and provide novel insights into the consequences of targeting SLAMF7 for the normal lymphocyte compartment. © 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.",,Article,Scopus

Reducing the risk of developing addiction among opioid-naïve patients exposed to prescribed opioids during the process of medical care may be an important primary prevention strategy. Our objective is to synthesize the available evidence about factors associated with the development of addiction among patients first exposed to prescribed opioids, with a focus on opioid-naïve patients. Methods: We will perform a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and other databases in collaboration with a health information specialist using a comprehensive search strategy. We will also supplement our search with a scan of the grey literature to identify relevant ongoing and unpublished studies. We will include studies reporting on risk factors for opioid addiction in patients prescribed opioid analgesic therapy through a prescription from a licensed medical professional, with a focus on opioid-naïve patients. We will exclude studies focusing on patients who are first exposed to illicit opioids, those who use prescription opioids for cancer pain, and/or who are palliative. Two reviewers will independently review titles, abstracts, and full texts for inclusion and exclusion criteria. They will then extract data from included full texts using standardized piloted data extraction forms and assess study quality through risk of bias assessment. We will synthesize the effect sizes of risk factors derived from clinically homogenous studies with similar designs and the remaining ones qualitatively. Discussion: Understanding risk factors for opioid addiction among patients who require analgesia has the potential to inform clinical care and opioid prescribing guidelines aiming to reduce opioid addiction. We will also use this information as a starting point for developing interventions for primary prevention. © 2017 The Author(s).","Medication safety; Opioid addiction; Opioid dependence; Opioid prescribing; Opioid use disorder; Opioid-naïve; Protocol; Risk factors; Systematic review",Article,Scopus

Especially for advanced disease no efficient standard therapy is currently available. Recently, somatostatin analogs have been evaluated for the treatment of HCC, however, with contradictory results. Besides, for both malignancies the chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been discussed as a possible new target structure. Methods: Expression of somatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtypes 1, 2A, 3, 4, and 5, and of CXCR4 was evaluated in a total of 71 HCCs and 27 CCCs by immunohistochemistry using well-characterized novel monoclonal antibodies. Results: In HCC tumor cells, frequency and intensity of expression of SSTRs and CXCR4 were only low. CXCR4 was present in about 40% of the HCCs, although at a low intensity. SSTR5, SSTR2, and SSTR3 were detected in about 15%, 8%, and 5% of the HCC tumors, respectively. SSTR and CXCR4 expression was much higher in CCC than in HCC. CXCR4 and SSTR1 were present in 60% and 67% of the CCC samples, respectively, followed by SSTR2 and SSTR5, which were detected in 30% and 11% of the tumors, respectively. Most notably, CXCR4 was intensely expressed on the tumor capillaries in about 50% of the HCCs and CCCs. CXCR4 expression on tumor vessels was associated with poor patient outcomes. Conclusions: CCC, but not HCC, may be suitable for SSTR-based treatments. Because of the predominant expression of SSTR1, pan-somatostatin analogs should be preferred. In both HCC and CCC, indirect targeting of tumors via the CXCR4-positive tumor capillaries may represent a promising additional therapeutic strategy. © 2017 The Author(s).","Chemokine receptor; Cholangiocellular carcinoma; CXCR4; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Somatostatin receptors",Article,Scopus

We prospectively collected radical nephrectomy (RN) specimens, to analyze the histological changes within peritumoral and distant parenchyma. Methods: Data of patients who underwent RN and had no known history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or chronic kidney disease etc., were prospectively collected. Tumor pseudo-capsule (PC), and parenchyma within 2 cm from tumor margin, were pathologically assessed. The parenchyma beyond PC or tumor margin was divided into 20 subsections of 1 mm in width. Histological changes, including chronic inflammation, glomerulosclerosis, arteriosclerosis and nephrosclerosis, were given scores of 0, 1, 2 or 3 for each subsection of each specimen, according to their severity. The 20 subsections of each specimen were further divided into four groups according to the distance from the tumor edge (group 1: 0-2 mm; group 2: 2-5 mm; group 3: 5-10 mm; group 4: 10-20 mm), to better compare the peritumoral parenchyma with the distant parenchyma. Results: In total, 53 patients were involved in this study. All tumors were confirmed RCCs (clear cell vs. papillary vs. chromophobe were 83% vs. 5.7% vs. 11.3%, respectively), with a mean size of 5.6 cm. Histological changes were more severe in peritumoral parenchyma close to PC or tumor edge (0-5 mm), and less common within parenchyma more distant from the tumor (5-20 mm) (p < 0.001). chronic inflammation and nephrosclerosis were the most common changes especially in peritumoral parenchyma (0-2 mm). PC was present in 49 tumors (92.5%), and PC invasion occurred in 5 cases (10.2%). Mean PC thickness was 0.7 mm. PCs were more likely to be present in clear cell RCC or papillary RCC than in chromophobe RCC (100% vs. 100% vs. 33.3%, respectively; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Most RCCs have a well-developed PC, especially clear cell RCC. Histological changes mainly occur in peritumoral parenchyma, being rather uncommon in distant parenchyma. A compression band filled with severe histological changes was typically observed in renal parenchyma close to the tumor.

In focal therapy the tumor lesion is targeted while sparing adjacent anatomical structures that are of importance for urinary, rectal, and erectile function, aiming for functional preservation. The first phase 1-2 trials in human showed that irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a safe and effective treatment modality for focal therapy in localized prostate cancer. Functional outcomes are promising, while all treated patients being pad-free continent following the IRE procedure. Potency was preserved in 56-95% of the patients that had a good erectile function prior to the IRE procedure. Although good short-term oncological outcome has been shown, long-term data are warranted.

Recent data suggest that malignant breast cancer cells often become resistant to TRAIL. Pterostilbene (PTER), a naturally occurring analogue of resveratrol found in blueberries, is known to induce cancer cells to undergo apoptosis. In the present study, we examined whether PTER affects TRAIL-induced apoptosis and its mechanism in TRAIL-resistant triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Our data indicated that PTER induced apoptosis (14.68 ± 3.78% for 40 μM PTER vs 1.98 ± 0.25% for control, p < 0.01) in TNBC cells and enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant TNBC cells (18.45 ± 4.65% for 40 μM PTER vs 29.38 ± 6.35% for combination of 40 μM PTER and 100 ng/mL TRAIL, p < 0.01). We demonstrated that PTER induced death receptors DR5 and DR4 as well as decreased decoy receptor DcR-1 and DcR-2 expression. PTER also decreased the antiapoptotic proteins c-FLIPS/L, Bcl-Xl, Bcl-2, survivin, and XIAP. PTER induced the cleavage of bid protein and caused proapoptotic Bax accumulation. Moreover, we found that PTER induced the expression of DR4 and DR5 through the reactive oxygen species (ROS)/ endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/ERK 1/2 and p38/C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) signaling pathways. Overall, our results showed that PTER potentiated TRAIL-induced apoptosis via ROS-mediated CHOP activation leading to the expression of DR4 and DR5. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","death receptor; pterostilbene; ROS; TRAIL; triple negative breast cancer",Article,Scopus

In addition to primary disease, lung is a common site for metastatic disease from colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma [1]. Partial (lobectomy) or complete resection of the lung remains the gold standard for treating this disease. However, surgery reduces lung capacity and results in significant reduction in quality of life in the postsurgical setting. Image-guided ablation is a suitable alternative to patients for whom surgery is contraindicated as this treatment approach can preserve lung volume and function and allow re-treatment in case of recurrent or metachronous disease. Ablation can be performed as a same day discharge procedure with minimal loss of lung function. When used as palliation, ablation will not impact quality of life associated with recovery from a surgical procedure. Unlike surgery, chemotherapy need not be interrupted, and image-guided therapy may also support treatment at earlier time points while avoiding risk of undesirable symptoms. Finally, ablation presents a lower technical burden to physicians and resource limited hospitals and therefore may be well suited for wider use. Ablation techniques that induce significant alterations in temperature of the targeted tissue are currently used to treat tumors in the lung. Such thermal ablation techniques pose certain efficacy limitations and risks that necessitate investigation of alternate ablation therapies for use in the lung. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) has the potential to overcome these limitations and serve as an important option for treatment of primary and metastatic disease in the lung. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,Book Chapter,Scopus

Whilst it is clear that factors such as age at diagnosis, social support and ethnicity can influence coping mechanisms, there is currently no information about whether breast reconstruction changes mechanisms of coping for such patients. The aims of this study, therefore, were to determine how women who have had immediate breast reconstruction and mastectomy cope, compared to those who have mastectomy alone, and whether there are differences in coping mechanisms due to breast reconstruction surgery. This was a retrospective cohort study, using a standardised questionnaire called the Brief Cope Scale. Inclusion criteria was the following: all women who had immediate breast reconstruction and mastectomy in Shropshire from 2003 to 2014 for ductal carcinoma in situ or node-negative invasive breast cancer. Each patient was matched for year of diagnosis, adjuvant therapy and age to one woman who had mastectomy alone. Two hundred thirty-four questionnaires were sent with a 58% response rate. Significantly more patients from the reconstruction cohort coped by active coping (T value 1.66, P value 0.04) compared to those in the mastectomy alone cohort. In contrast, significantly more patients in the mastectomy alone cohort coped by active venting compared to the reconstruction cohort (T value 1.71, P value 0.04).

The current work was designed to measure the rates of distress in a sample of patients being hospitalized in a multidisciplinary outpatient surgery clinic. Objective: To measure the rates of distress in a sample of patients referring to a multidisciplinary day surgery division in a comprehensive cancer center based in Northern Italy. Methods: A total of 177 patients were asked to fill in the (DT) before surgery. Results: Out of 177 patients, 154 (87%) patients completed the DT. While 13% of the patients indicated a total absence of distress, more than half of the sample declared a moderate or high distress. A total of 55% of patients presented at least three difficulties in the Problem List Checklist. Distress was not correlated with age or other medical and clinical variables. Number of emotional problems was the best predictor of distress at admission (β = 0.655, ρ = 0.000). Conclusion: Screening for distress in a day surgery multidisciplinary oncology division is feasible and a relevant percentage of patients can be identified as clinically distressed. Outcomes also highlight the impact of age and precise physical and psycho-social signs as prognostic indicators of clinically significant distress. Measurement of distress and associated problems list represent the preliminary endpoint toward adequate recommendations that contribute to taking care of distress in cancer patients in cost-effective clinical setting. © 2016 Arnaboldi, Riva, Vadilonga, Tadini, Magon and Pravettoni.","Decision making; Distress; Distress thermometer; Needs assessment; Psychological assessment",Article,Scopus

A total of 87 breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel at a dose 75 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks as a single agent in adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled in this study. Baseline AAG was determined at the day before usage of decetaxel in the first cycle. Febrile neutropenia, grade 3-4 stomatitis, grade 3-4 diarrhea and severe asthenia was determined as safety end points. Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Effects (CTCAE) V4.0 was used to evaluated the adverse effects during the first cycle of chemotherapy. The mean age of patients was 47.7±8.89 years. Mean baseline AAG was 0.99±0.24 g/L. Primary adverse effects during the chemotherapy was febrile neutropenia (30%), grade 3-4 stomatitis (17%), grade 3-4 diarrhea (23%), and severe asthenia (20%). Among those adverse effects, febrile neutropenia, grade 3-4 stomatitis and grade 3-4 diarrhea had shown significant association with mean difference of baseline AAG (P &lt; 0.01). Patients who developed febrile neutropenia (n = 26) had lower baseline AAG level of 0.838±0.192 g/L compared with 1.051±0.236 g/L in patients who did not experience such effect (n = 61). Also, the level of baseline AAG in patients who had grade 3-4 stomatitis (0.760±0.176 g/L) and grade 3-4 diarrhea 0.800±0.172 g/L) is lower than those who did not had these events.

Methods: Eligible patients had undergone breast conservative surgery for early breast cancer (pTis-2) and none/limited nodal involvement. Hypo-WBI consisted of 34 Gy in 10 daily fractions over 2 weeks to the whole breast three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT), followed by a single fraction of 8 Gy to the tumor bed after 1 week (electrons). Primary endpoint is freedom from ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). Minimum follow up for living & event-free patients is 3 yrs.; median follow up time of the whole analyzed patient population is 5.4 yrs. (range: 1.8-11.4 yrs). Results: Two hundred fifty-one patients were accrued from 2004 to 2013. All patients underwent local excision of the primary tumor to negative margins. Four patients failed in the ipsilateral breast after a median time of 3.2 years (range: 1.7-5.7 yrs) for a 5-year IBTR-free survival of 98.7% (95%CI: 97.3%-100%). IBTR-free survival was significantly higher for patients with invasive cancer than for patients with intraductal carcinoma (p = 0.036). Within patients with invasive tumors, no clear trends or associations were detected between IBTR and age, grading, molecular subtype, pT or pN stage. At 5 years, the actuarial rates of GR2 fibrosis and GR2+ teleangectasia are 2.4% (95%CI: 0-6.5%) and 7.1% (95%CI: 0.4-13.7%), respectively. Cosmesis was scored as excellent/good by ≈95% of patients and ≈60% of clinicians. Conclusions: Hypo-WBI in 3 weeks allows excellent oncologic outcomes for invasive breast cancer after conservative surgery.

Here, using techniques adapted from microbial experimental evolution, we investigate the evolution of tumour spreading - a precursor for metastasis and tissue invasion - in environments with varied resource supply. Evolutionary theory predicts that competition for resources within a population will select for individuals to move away from a natal site (i.e. disperse), facilitating the colonisation of unexploited resources and decreasing competition between kin. Results: After approximately 100 generations in environments with low resource supply, we find that MCF7 breast cancer spheroids (small in vitro tumours) show increased spreading. Conversely, spreading slows compared to the ancestor where resource supply is high. Common garden experiments confirm that the evolutionary responses differ between selection lines; with lines evolved under low resource supply showing phenotypic plasticity in spheroid spreading rate. These differences in spreading behaviour between selection lines are heritable (stable across multiple generations), and show that the divergently evolved lines differ in their response to resource supply. Conclusions: We observe dispersal-like behaviour and an increased sensitivity to resource availability in our selection lines, which may be a response to selection, or alternatively may be due to epigenetic changes, provoked by prolonged resource limitation, that have persisted across many cell generations. Different clinical strategies may be needed depending on whether or not tumour progression is due to natural selection. This study highlights the effectiveness of experimental evolution approaches in cancer cell populations and demonstrates how simple model systems might enable us to observe and measure key selective drivers of clinically important traits. © 2017 The Author(s).","Dispersal; Epigenetic; Experimental evolution; Metastasis; Microenvironment; Plasticity; Resource competition",Article,Scopus

Inclusion criteria were the term ICF in title or abstract and Switzerland as the workplace of the first author. Identified publications were analysed as descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 83 articles were included in the analysis. Forty-seven different first authors from 24 different institutions were identified. The majority of publications were from Swiss Paraplegic Research (68.7%) and focused on neurology (31.3%). Forty-six cohort studies were identified.

In addition, hypoxia situation in the tumor microenvironment also promotes the growth and metastasis of tumors. Multifunctional nanocarriers with stimuli-activation and hypoxia-relieving properties can help overcome some of these limitations. In this study, we have constructed a nanocarrier which is named PBMn-DOX@RBC. A Prussian blue/manganese dioxide (PBMn) nanoparticle is used as an oxygen precursor or catalyzer for H 2 O 2 activation, and a red blood cell (RBC) membrane is used to increase the loading capacity of doxorubicin (DOX) and prolong the circulation time in vivo. H 2 O 2 is overproduced in tumor tissues and tumor cells. It can be used as a stimulus to activate drug release. In the presence of H 2 O 2 , the hypoxia inside the tumors is relieved by the administration of PBMn-DOX@RBC. The generated oxygen disrupts the RBC coated on the surface of PBMn, which accelerates the release of DOX. RBCs also prolong the circulation time of the nanometer system in vivo. By combining the photothermal therapy (PTT) and chemotherapy, the tumor growth inhibition mediated by PBMn-DOX@RBC is further enhanced. PBMn-DOX@RBC fulfills the demands to relieve tumor hypoxia and enhance cancer chemotherapy/PTT. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","chemotherapy; combinational therapy; hypoxia; long circulation; photothermal therapy",Article,Scopus

The coverage includes the history of IRE, general technique, preclinical research, applications in clinical practice and early clinical results, and future perspectives. Contraindications, treatment planning, potential complications, follow-up imaging, and other practical aspects are fully discussed, with highlighting of useful tips and tricks. Through the delivery of short but highly intense electrical pulses, IRE results in tumor cell membrane permeabilization, causing cells to go into apoptosis. The minimally invasive nature of IRE, combined with the prospect of completely eradicating tumors while preserving delicate structures in the ablation zone, makes IRE the object of worldwide clinical research.

Previous studies have shown that Rho GTPase activity is required for macrophage mobility, yet the roles of upstream regulatory proteins controlling Rho GTPase function in these cells are not well defined. Previously we have shown that the RhoA GEF Net1 is required for human breast cancer cell motility and extracellular matrix invasion. To assess the role of Net1 in macrophage motility, we isolated bone marrow macrophage (BMM) precursors from wild type and Net1 knockout mice. Loss of Net1 did not affect the ability of BMM precursors to differentiate into mature macrophages in vitro, as measured by CD68 and F4/80 staining. However, Net1 deletion significantly reduced RhoA activation, F-actin accumulation, adhesion, and motility in these cells. Nevertheless, similar to RhoA/RhoB double knockout macrophages, Net1 deletion did not impair macrophage recruitment to the peritoneum in a mouse model of sterile inflammation. These data demonstrate that Net1 is an important regulator of RhoA signaling and motility in mouse macrophages in vitro, but that its function may be dispensable for macrophage recruitment to inflammatory sites in vivo. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC","actin; adhesion; macrophage; motility; Net1; RhoA",Article in Press,Scopus

The strategy leverages the large difference in extracellular and intracellular glutathione levels to deliver selenosulfide phosphatase inhibitors to cells.

The lead selenosulfide inhibitors enable potent and selective inhibition of their respective targets over a panel of human PTPs and a representative cysteine protease.

Materials and Methods: Twelve dogs underwent reconstruction of large ventral skin defects following mammary tumor excision with wide margins. Skin fold flaps (flank fold flap and elbow fold flap) were elevated from the flank and elbow region, respectively, and transposed and sutured onto the large ventral skin defect following mastectomy in all the dogs. In addition to the skin fold flaps, other reconstructive techniques such as undermining, walking sutures, and tension-relieving suture techniques were followed during surgery in the closure of large skin defects without skin tension and compromising limb mobility. The skin flap viability was assessed subjectively by gross observation of the flap such as color, temperature, capillary perfusion, and cosmetic appearance, and scoring (1-4) was done. Tissue samples were collected from a surgical site on days 3, 6, and 12 post-operatively for histopathological evaluation and healing status of the skin flap. Results: All the surgical wounds healed primarily, without any major complications and the skin flap remained healthy throughout the healing process post-operatively. Distal flap necrosis was noticed in one case and necrosis of skin flap between two suture lines was noticed in another case in which the necrotized distal portion healed by secondary intention after 7 days. The mean survival of subdermal plexus flap in the above cases was 98% which was a subjective evaluation based on surface area of the skin defect measured by Image 'J software and the flap dimensions. The average healing of skin flap in days was 14.91±0.86.

The aim of this study was to determine a descriptive profile of 80 women and establish a description of risk factors associated with breast cancer in these women. Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited women with breast cancer in Ouagadougou. Teaching Hospital Yalgado Ouedraogo in Burkina Faso from January 2015 to February 2016. We have collected data on socio-demographic characteristics, reproductive status, clinical information, treatment and molecular characteristics. Results: The average age of the study population was 48.2±12.4 years. Family history of breast cancer was reported in 18.75% of the studied participants against 16.25% family history for other types of cancer. Patients from urban areas represented 87.5% of our studied population with 58.75% of household, multiparous (55.0%), no aborts status (56.2%), post-menopausal women (53.75%), no oral contraception (63.75%), regular menstrual cycle (71.25%) and the prevalence of obesity was 12.5%. The clinical and molecular characteristics showed that left-sided breast cancer accounted for 51.25 %, high grade (II and III) represented 93.75 % of cases and the majority of tumors were infiltrating ductal carcinomas (93.75%) with stages III and IV accounted for 50.0%. Conclusion: This study described the distribution of risks factors in a population of breast cancer women.

The mutation drives unusual monoallelic expression of TERT, allowing immortalization. Here, we find that DNA methylation of the TERT CpG island (CGI) is also allele-specific in multiple cancers. The expressed allele is hypomethylated, which is opposite to cancers without TERT promoter mutations. The continued presence of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) on the inactive allele suggests that histone marks of repressed chromatin may be causally linked to high DNA methylation. Consistent with this hypothesis, TERT promoter DNA containing 5-methyl-CpG has much increased affinity for PRC2 in vitro. Thus, CpG methylation and histone marks appear to collaborate to maintain the two TERT alleles in different epigenetic states in TERT promoter mutant cancers. Finally, in several cancers, DNA methylation levels at the TERT CGI correlate with altered patient survival. The promoter for a telomerase gene (TERT) is the third most frequently mutated site in cancer. These mutations drive unusual expression of TERT from a single allele, allowing unceasing cell division. Stern et al. identify modifications of the promoter that appear to collaborate to maintain this expression pattern in these cancers. © 2017 The Author(s)","5-methylcytosine; allele-specific; cancer; CpG island; monoallelic; Polycomb repressive complex 2; PRC2; telomerase; TERT promoter",Article,Scopus

We find that oncogenic BRAF paradoxically suppresses stem cell renewal and instead promotes differentiation. Correspondingly, tumor formation is inefficient in BRAF-driven mouse models of colon cancer. By reducing levels of differentiation via genetic manipulation of either of two distinct differentiation-promoting factors (Smad4 or Cdx2), stem cell activity is restored in BRAF V600E intestines, and the oncogenic capacity of BRAF V600E is amplified. In human patients, we observe that reduced levels of differentiation in normal tissue is associated with increased susceptibility to serrated colon tumors. Together, these findings help resolve the conditions necessary for BRAF-driven colon cancer initiation. Additionally, our results predict that genetic and/or environmental factors that reduce tissue differentiation will increase susceptibility to serrated colon cancer. These findings offer an opportunity to identify susceptible individuals by assessing their tissue-differentiation status. Despite high frequency in serrated colon tumors, BRAF V600E inefficiently drives tumorigenesis in mouse models, and paradoxically, BRAF V600E triggers stem cell loss. BRAF-driven tumorigenesis increases in genetic models that reduce differentiation and restore stem cell activity.

PKM2, a splice isoformof the pyruvate kinase (PK) specifically expressed in these cells, serves as a major regulator of this metabolic reprogramming with an adjustable activity subjected to numerous allosteric effectors and posttranslational modifications. Here, we have identified a posttranslational modification on PKM2, O-GlcNAcylation, which specifically targets Thr 405 and Ser 406 , residues of the region encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 10 in cancer cells. We show that PKM2 O-GlcNAcylation is up-regulated in various types of human tumor cells and patient tumor tissues. Themodification destabilized the active tetrameric PKM2, reduced PK activity, and led to nuclear translocation of PKM2.We also observed that the modification was associated with an increased glucose consumption and lactate production and enhanced level of lipid and DNA synthesis, indicating that O-GlcNAcylation promotes the Warburg effect. In vivo experiments showed that blocking PKM2 O-GlcNAcylation attenuated tumor growth.

Here, we analyzed human breast cancer data to identify transcriptional programs associated with tumors bearing specific genetic driver alterations. Using an unbiased approach, we identified thousands of genes whose expression was enriched in tumors with specific genetic alterations. However, expression of the vast majority of these genes was not enriched if associations were analyzed within individual breast tumor molecular subtypes, across multiple tumor types, or after gene expression was normalized to account for differences in proliferation or tumor lineage. Together with linear modeling results, these findings suggest that most transcriptional programs associated with specific genetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors are highly context-dependent and are predominantly linked to differences in proliferation programs between distinct breast cancer subtypes. We demonstrate that such proliferation-dependent gene expression dominates tumor transcriptional programs relative to matched normal tissues. However, we also identified a relatively small group of cancer-associated genes that are both proliferation- and lineage-independent. A subset of these genes are attractive candidate targets for combination therapy because they are essential in breast cancer cell lines, druggable, enriched in stem-like breast cancer cells, and resistant to chemotherapy-induced down-regulation.","Bioinformatics; Breast cancer; Gene expression; Oncogene; Tumor biology",Article,Scopus

TNBC tumors that fail to respond to chemotherapy are characterized by a repressed IFN/signal transducer and activator of transcription (IFN/STAT) gene signature and are often enriched for cancer stem cells (CSCs). We have found that human mammary epithelial cells that undergo an epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) following transformation acquire CSC properties. These mesenchymal/CSCs have a significantly repressed IFN/STAT gene expression signature and an enhanced ability to migrate and form tumor spheres. Treatment with IFN-beta (IFN-β) led to a less aggressive epithelial/non-CSC-like state, with repressed expression of mesenchymal proteins (VIMENTIN, SLUG), reduced migration and tumor sphere formation, and reexpression of CD24 (a surface marker for non-CSCs), concomitant with an epithelium-like morphology. The CSC-like properties were correlated with high levels of unphosphorylated IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (U-ISGF3), which was previously linked to resistance to DNA damage. Inhibiting the expression of IRF9 (the DNA-binding component of U-ISGF3) reduced the migration of mesenchymal/CSCs. Here we report a positive translational role for IFN-β, as gene expression profiling of patient-derived TNBC tumors demonstrates that an IFN-β metagene signature correlates with improved patient survival, an immune response linked with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and a repressed CSC metagene signature. Taken together, our findings indicate that repressed IFN signaling in TNBCs with CSC-like properties is due to high levels of U-ISGF3 and that treatment with IFN-β reduces CSC properties, suggesting a therapeutic strategy to treat drug-resistant, highly aggressive TNBC tumors.","Cancer stem cells; Interferon-beta; Triple-negative breast cancer; Tumor microenvironment",Article,Scopus

To address these issues, an oxygen-self-produced sonodynamic therapy (SDT) nanoplatform involving a modified fluorocarbon (FC)-chain-mediated oxygen delivery protocol has been established to realize highly efficient SDT against hypoxic pancreatic cancer. In this nanoplatform, mesopores and FC chains of FC-chain-functionalized hollow mesoporous organosilica nanoparticle carriers can provide sufficient storage capacity and binding sites for sonosensitizers (IR780) and oxygen, respectively. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate the nanoplatform involving this distinctive oxygen delivery protocol indeed breaks the hypoxia-specific transportation barriers, supplies sufficient oxygen to hypoxic PANC-1 cells especially upon exposure to ultrasound irradiation, and relieves hypoxia. Consequently, hypoxia-induced resistance to SDT is inhibited and sufficient highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced to kill PANC-1 cells and shrink hypoxic PANC-1 pancreatic cancer. This distinctive FC-chain-mediated oxygen delivery method provides an avenue to hypoxia oxygenation and holds great potential in mitigating hypoxia-induced resistance to those oxygen-depleted therapies, e.g., photodynamic therapy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","hypoxia reversion; hypoxia-induced resistance; oxygen delivery; reactive active species; sonodynamic treatment",Article,Scopus

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological responses and adaptation to aneuploidy are not well understood. Deciphering these mechanisms is important because aneuploidy is associated with diseases, including intellectual disability and cancer. Although tumors and mammalian aneuploid cells, including several cancer cell lines, show altered levels of sphingolipids, the role of sphingolipids in aneuploidy remains unknown. Here, we show that ceramides and long-chain bases, sphingolipid molecules that slow proliferation and promote survival, are increased by aneuploidy. Sphingolipid levels are tightly linked to serine synthesis, and inhibiting either serine or sphingolipid synthesis can specifically impair the fitness of aneuploid cells. Remarkably, the fitness of aneuploid cells improves or deteriorates upon genetically decreasing or increasing ceramides, respectively. Combined targeting of serine and sphingolipid synthesis could be exploited to specifically target cancer cells, the vast majority of which are aneuploid. Hwang et al. demonstrate that aneuploid yeast cells rely on the synthesis of the amino acid serine for their viability. Serine is used for the synthesis of sphingolipids that control the fitness of aneuploid cells. Aneuploid cells are vulnerable to combined inhibition of serine and sphingolipid biosynthesis. © 2017 The Author(s)","aneuploidy; ceramide; chromosomes; genomic istability; long-chain bases; metabolism; myriocin; serine; sphingolipids; sphingosine",Article,Scopus

A team-based learning (TBL) module focused on HPV for first-year medical students about HPV will better increase knowledge and likeliness to vaccinate than traditional education methods. Baseline HPV knowledge in medical students across Texas was assessed by surveying all 4-year undergraduate medical schools. Students at one medical school then participated in a week-long TBL focused on basic and clinical concepts relating to HPV, and then were re-surveyed upon completion of the course module. At baseline assessment, first-year student at the intervention site performed at the same level as first-year medical students across the state of Texas on knowledge and satisfaction with their HPV-related medical school education. After the TBL implementation, students performed significantly better than similar-year students and equal to graduating seniors, on knowledge of HPV- and HPV-related cancers, and report significantly higher satisfaction with education measures. Students at the intervention site were significantly more likely to recommend the HPV vaccination in future practice.

Moreover, pathologic fractures are associated with increased risk of death in people with disseminated malignancies. Therefore, prevention of pain and fractures are important goals in men with prostate cancer at risk for skeletal complications. Objectives: To assess the effects of bisphosphonates in men with bone metastases from prostate cancer. Search methods: We identified studies by electronic search of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and MEDLINE on 13 July 2017 and trial registries. We handsearched the Proceedings of American Society of Clinical Oncology (to July 2017) and reference lists of all eligible trials identified. This is an update of a review last published in 2006. Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled studies comparing the effectiveness of bisphosphonates in men with bone metastases from prostate cancer. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of trials. We defined the proportion of participants with pain response as the primary end point; secondary outcomes were skeletal-related events, mortality, quality of life, adverse events, analgesic consumption and disease progression. We assessed the quality of the evidence for the main outcomes using the GRADE approach. Main results: We included 18 trials reporting on 4843 participants comparing the effect of bisphosphonate administration to control regimens. Primary outcome: there was no clear difference in the proportion of participants with pain response (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.43; P = 0.20; I2 = 0%; 3 trials; 876 participants; low quality evidence). In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in a pain response in 40 more participants per 1000 (19 fewer to 114 more). Secondary outcomes: bisphosphonates probably reduced the incidence of skeletal-related events in participants with prostate cancer metastatic to bone (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.94; P = 0.27; I2 = 19%; 9 trials; 3153 participants; moderate quality evidence). In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in 58 fewer SREs per 1000 (85 fewer to 27 fewer). We found no clinically relevant differences in mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.04; P = 0.43; I2 = 1%; 9 trials; 2450 participants; moderate quality evidence). In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in 16 fewer deaths per 1000 (47 fewer to 21 more). Outcome definition of quality of life and the measurement tools varied greatly across trials and we were unable to extract any quantitative data for meta-analysis. Bisphosphonates probably increased the number of participants affected by nausea (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41; P = 0.05; I2 = 0%; 9 trials; 3008 participants; moderate quality evidence). In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in seven more cases of nausea per 1000 (0 fewer to 14 more). Bisphosphonates probably increased the number of renal adverse events (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.46; P = 0.01; I2 = 0%; 7 trials; 1794 participants; moderate quality evidence). In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in 22 more renal adverse events per 1000 (4 more to 50 more). We found no clear difference in the number of participants with osteonecrosis of the jaw between groups (RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 4.90; P = 0.17; I2 = 0%; 5 trials; 1626 participants; very low quality evidence). In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in seven more cases with osteonecrosis of the jaw per 1000 (2 fewer to 29 more). We observed no clinically relevant difference in the proportion of participants with decreased analgesic consumption (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.63; P = 0.28; I2 = 37%; 4 trials; 416 participants). Statistical analysis revealed that bisphosphonates probably reduced the number of participants with disease progression (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.98; P = 0.006; I2 = 0%; 7 trials; 2115 participants; moderate quality evidence). In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in 36 fewer cases of disease progression per 1000 (71 fewer to 7 fewer). Findings of our predefined subgroup and sensitivity analyses were no different from those of the primary analyses. Authors' conclusions: Based on low quality evidence, there may be no clinically relevant difference in the proportion of men with pain response between bisphosphonates and control regimens in men with bone metastases from prostate cancer. Bisphosphonates probably decrease the number of skeletal-related events and disease progression. These benefits need to be weighed against the increased risk of renal impairment and nausea in men receiving bisphosphonates. Future studies should explicitly evaluate patient important outcomes such as quality of life and pain by using standardized and comparable assessment tools. © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Herein we designed a donor-acceptor chromophore based nanoparticle (DAP) as a dual-modal image contrast agent has strong absorption in the NIR-I window and a strong fluorescence emission peak in the NIR-II region. The dual-modal DAPs composed of D-π-A-π-D-type chromophores were PEGylated through nanoprecipitation. The multifunctional DAP surface was thus available for subsequent bioconjugation of EGFR Affibody (Ac-Cys-Z EGFR:1907 ) to target EGFR-positive cancers. The Affibody-conjugated DAPs appeared as highly monodisperse nanoparticles (∼30 nm) with strong absorption in the NIR-I window (at ca. 680 nm) and an extremely high fluorescence in the NIR-II region (maximum peak at 1000 nm). Consequently, the Affibody-DAPs show significantly enhanced photoacoustic and NIR-II fluorescence contrast effects in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Moreover, the Affibody-DAPs have the capability to selectively target EGFR-positive tumors in an FTC-133 subcutaneous mouse model with relatively high photoacoustic and fluorescent signals. By taking advantage of high spatial resolution and excellent temporal resolution, photoacoustic/NIR-II fluorescence imaging with targeted dual-modal contrast agents allows us to specifically image and detect various cancers and diseases in an accurate manner. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","donor-acceptor chromophore; epidermal growth factor receptor; near-infrared window II; photoacoustic imaging; thyroid carcinoma",Article,Scopus

METHODS: Two hundred bone marrow samples were obtained at diagnosis from 200 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were studied between September 2008 and December 2010 at our Institution (Hematology Department, Lyon, France). The CD34/CD38 cell profile was analyzed by multiparameter flowcytometry approach using 8C panels and FACS CANTO and Diva software (BD Bioscience). RESULTS: We analyzed CD34 and CD38 expression in bone marrow samples of 200 AML patients at diagnosis, and investigated the prognostic value of the most immature CD34+CD38- population. Using a cut-off value of 1% of CD34+CD38- from total ""bulk leukemic cells"" we found that a high (> 1%) level of CD34+CD38- blasts at diagnosis was correlated with advanced age, adverse cytogenetics as well as with a lower rate of complete response after induction and shorter disease-free survival.

After a presumptive diagnosis of intracranial neoplasia is established based on history, clinical signs and advanced imaging characteristics, the decision to treat and which treatment to choose must be considered. The objective of this study is to report survival times (ST) for dogs with intracranial meningiomas and gliomas treated with surgical resection alone (SRA), to identify potential prognostic factors affecting survival, and to compare the results with the available literature. Medical records of 29 dogs with histopathologic confirmation of intracranial meningiomas and gliomas treated with SRA were retrospectively reviewed. For each dog, signalment, clinical signs, imaging findings, type of surgery, treatment, histological evaluation, and ST were obtained. Twenty-nine dogs with a histological diagnosis who survived >7 days after surgery were included. There were 15 (52%) meningiomas and 14 (48%) gliomas. All tumors had a rostrotentorial location. At the time of the statistical analysis, only two dogs were alive. Median ST for meningiomas was 422 days (mean, 731 days; range, 10-2735 days). Median ST for gliomas was 66 days (mean, 117 days; range, 10-730 days). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that ST was significantly longer for meningiomas than for gliomas (P<0.05). A negative correlation between the presence of a midline shift and ST (P=0.037) and ventricular compression and ST (P=0.038) was observed for meningiomas. For gliomas, there were no significant associations between ST and any of the variables evaluated. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that, for dogs that survived >7 days postoperatively, SRA might be an appropriate treatment, particularly for meningiomas, when radiation therapy is not readily available. Also, the presence of midline shift and ventricular compression might be negative prognostic factors for dogs with meningiomas. © 2018, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tripoli.

Here, using suspended fibers, we report integrative and multiscale abilities to study protrusive behavior independent of cell body migration. By manipulating the diameter of fibers in orthogonal directions, we constrain cell migration along large diameter (2 μm) base fibers, while solely allowing cells to sense, initiate, and mature protrusions on orthogonally deposited high-curvature/low diameter (∼100, 200, and 600 nm) protrusive fibers and low-curvature (∼300 and 600 nm width) protrusive flat ribbons. In doing so, we report a set of morphodynamic metrics that precisely quantitate protrusion dynamics. Protrusion growth and maturation occur by rapid broadening at the base to achieve long lengths, a behavior dramatically influenced by curvature. While flat ribbons universally induce the formation of broad and long protrusions, we quantitatively protrutype protrusive behavior of two highly invasive cancer cell lines and find breast adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB-231) to exhibit sensitivity to fiber curvature higher than that of brain glioblastoma DBTRG-05MG. Furthermore, while actin and microtubules localize within protrusions of all sizes, we quantify protrusion size-driven localization of vimentin and, contrary to current understanding, report that vimentin is not required to form protrusions.

Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is one of the enzymes associated with the chromatin for post-translational modifications, where it demethylates lysine amino acid in the chromatin H3 tail. Many studies showed that inhibiting LSD1 could potentially be used to treat cancer epigenetically. LSD1 is associated with its corepressor protein CoREST, and it uses tetrahydrofolate as a co-factor to accept CH2 from the demethylation process. In this study, the co-crystallized co-factor tetrahydrofolate was utilized to determine possible binding regions in the active center of the LSD1/CoREST complex. Also, the flexibility of the complex has been investigated by molecular dynamics simulation and subsequent analysis by clustering and principal component analysis. This research supported other studies and showed that LSD1/CoREST complex exists in two main conformational structures: open and closed. Furthermore, this study showed that tetrahydrofolate stably binds to the LSD1/CoREST complex, in its open conformation, at its entrance. It then binds to the core of the complex, inducing the closed conformation. Furthermore, the interactions of tetrahydrofolate to these two binding regions and the corresponding binding mode of tetrahydrofolate were investigated to be used in structure-based drug design. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,Article,Scopus

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which can lead to colitis-associated cancer (CAC), is thought to involve chronic microbial irritation following a breach of the mucosal intestinal epithelium. However, the innate immune pathways responsible for regulating these inflammatory processes remain to be fully clarified. Here, we show that commensal bacteria influence STING signaling predominantly in mononuclear phagocytes to produce both pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as anti-inflammatory IL-10. Enterocolitis, manifested through loss of IL-10, was completely abrogated in the absence of STING. Intestinal inflammation was less severe in the absence of cGAS, possibly suggesting a role for cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) indirectly regulating STING signaling. Our data shed insight into the causes of inflammation and provide a potential therapeutic target for prevention of IBD. Ahn et al. find a key role for STING signaling in controlling gut homeostasis. Loss of STING reverses colitis observed in the absence of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in mice.

Calcium binds to the N-terminal domain of troponin C (cNTnC) which initiates the process of contraction. Heart failure is a consequence of a disruption of this process. With the prevalence of this condition, a strong need exists to find novel compounds to increase the calcium sensitivity of cNTnC. Desirable are small chemical molecules that bind to the interface between cTnC and the cTnI switch peptide and exhibit calcium sensitizing properties by possibly stabilizing cTnC in an open conformation. To identify novel drug candidates, we employed a structure-based drug discovery protocol that incorporated the use of a relaxed complex scheme (RCS). In preparation for the virtual screening, cNTnC conformations were identified based on their ability to correctly predict known cNTnC binders using a receiver operating characteristics analysis. Following a virtual screen of the National Cancer Institute's Developmental Therapeutic Program database, a small number of molecules were experimentally tested using stopped-flow kinetics and steady-state fluorescence titrations. We identified two novel compounds, 3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-6,7-chromanediol (NSC600285) and 3-(4-methylphenyl)-7,8-chromanediol (NSC611817), that show increased calcium sensitivity of cTnC in the presence of the regulatory domain of cTnI. The effects of NSC600285 and NSC611817 on the calcium dissociation rate was stronger than that of the known calcium sensitizer bepridil. Thus, we identified a 3-phenylchromane group as a possible key pharmacophore in the sensitization of cardiac muscle contraction.

Prostate tumors invariably overexpress prostate surface membrane antigen (PSMA). We designed a nonviral vector, PEI-PEG-DUPA (PPD), comprising polyethylenimine-polyethyleneglycol (PEI-PEG) tethered to the PSMA ligand, 2-[3-(1, 3-dicarboxy propyl)ureido] pentanedioic acid (DUPA), to treat PC. The purpose of PEI is to bind polyinosinic/polycytosinic acid (polyIC) and allow endosomal release, while DUPA targets PC cells. PolyIC activates multiple pathways that lead to tumor cell death and to the activation of bystander effects that harness the immune system against the tumor, attacking nontargeted neighboring tumor cells and reducing the probability of acquired resistance and disease recurrence. Targeting polyIC directly to tumor cells avoids the toxicity associated with systemic delivery. PPD selectively delivered polyIC into PSMA-overexpressing PC cells, inducing apoptosis, cytokine secretion, and the recruitment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PSMA-overexpressing tumors in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice with partially reconstituted immune systems were significantly shrunken following PPD/polyIC treatment, in all cases. Half of the tumors showed complete regression. PPD/polyIC invokes antitumor immunity, but unlike many immunotherapies does not need to be personalized for each patient.

Inspired by such a biological fact, and together with various operations of polynomials, I here propose polynomial-life model toward analysis of some phenomena in multicellular organisms. Polynomial life consists of multicells that are expressed as multivariable polynomials. A cell is expressed as a term of polynomial, in which point (Formula presented.) is described as a term (Formula presented.) and the condition is described as its coefficient. Starting with a single term and following reductions by set of polynomials, I simulate the development from a cell to a multicell. In order to confirm uniqueness of the eventual multicell-pattern, Gröbner base can be used, which has been conventionally used to ensure uniqueness of normal form in the mathematical context. In this framework, I present various patterns through the polynomial-life model and discuss patterns maintained through turnover. Cell elimination seems to play an important role in turnover, which may shed some light on cancer or regenerative medicine. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company","multivariable polynomials; polynomial life; Regeneration; turnover",Article in Press,Scopus

Particle clustering leading to complex magnetic interactions affects the heat generated by MNPs during MH. The heat efficiencies, theoretically predicted, are still poorly understood because of a lack of control of the fabrication of such clusters with defined geometries and thus their functionality. This study aims to correlate the heating efficiency under MH of individually coated iron oxide nanocubes (IONCs) versus soft colloidal nanoclusters made of small groupings of nanocubes arranged in different geometries. The controlled clustering of alkyl-stabilized IONCs is achieved here during the water transfer procedure by tuning the fraction of the amphiphilic copolymer, poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) cumene-terminated, to the nanoparticle surface. It is found that increasing the polymer-to-nanoparticle surface ratio leads to the formation of increasingly large nanoclusters with defined geometries. When compared to the individual nanocubes, we show here that controlled grouping of nanoparticles - so-called ""dimers"" and ""trimers"" composed of two and three nanocubes, respectively - increases specific absorption rate (SAR) values, while conversely, forming centrosymmetric clusters having more than four nanocubes leads to lower SAR values.

However, their reduced radiation-absorption efficiency and limited surface area hinder their further radiochemotherapeutic applications.

Especially, ""embedded"" structured dual-mesoporous silica nanospheres (E-DMSNs) containing connected large mesopores (&gt;10 nm) and abundant small mesopores (2-3 nm) in the large-pore framework have been prepared for the first time. Moreover, by employing PS-b-PAA with shorter PAA block lengths as template, the morphology conversion of porous silica nanospheres from core-shell structured dual-mesoporous silica nanospheres to well-defined hollow mesoporous silica nanospheres has been achieved. To endow the capability of E-DMSNs as multidrug delivery vehicles, a spatially selective functionalization strategy has been adopted to obtain dual-functionalized E-DMSNs (E-DMSNs-NH 2 /OH) with amino-functionalized large mesopores and hydroxyl-modified small mesopores.

However, it causes cardiotoxicity partly because of the formation of reactive oxygen species. CYP2J2 is a human cytochrome P450 that is strongly expressed in cardiomyocytes. It converts arachidonic acid (AA) into four different regioisomers of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). Using kinetic analyses, we show that AA metabolism by CYP2J2 is modulated by DOX. We show that cytochrome P450 reductase, the redox partner of CYP2J2, metabolizes DOX to 7-deoxydoxorubicin aglycone (7-de-aDOX). This metabolite then binds to CYP2J2 and inhibits and alters the preferred site of metabolism of AA, leading to a change in the ratio of the EET regioisomers. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations indicate that 7-de-aDOX and AA can concurrently bind to the CYP2J2 active site to produce these changes in the site of AA metabolism. To determine if these observations are unique to DOX/7-de-aDOX, we use noncardiotoxic DOX analogues, zorubicin (ZRN) and 5-iminodaunorubicin (5-IDN). ZRN and 5-IDN inhibit CYP2J2-mediated AA metabolism but do not change the ratio of EET regioisomers. Altogether, we demonstrate that DOX and 7-de-aDOX inhibit CYP2J2-mediated AA metabolism and 7-de-aDOX binds close to the active site to alter the ratio of cardioprotective EETs.

Methods: Subcutaneous tumor model of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma using TE-8 cells was established. Tumor bearing Balb/c(nu/nu) mice (60 mice) were divided into four groups, Cont group that treated with normal oxygen level, HBO group that treated with hyperbaric oxygen, RSI group that treated with radioactive seed implantation, and HBO+RSI group that treated with hyperbaric oxygen combined with radioactive seed implantation. Tumor volume ratio and mean survival time of tumor bearing mice were observed. Pathological changes of tumor tissue after treatment were observed by hematoxylin eosin (HE) staining. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kit was used to detect oxidative stress. Apoptosis related proteins were detected by Western blot. Results: After treatment, the tumor volume ratio of HBO+RSI group was 3.51 ±0.80 and was significantly lower than that of Conl group, HBO group, and RSI group (P < 0.05). The mean survival time of HBO+RSI group tumor bearing mice was 62 d and was significantly longer than that in Cont group, HBO group, and RSI group (P < 0.05). HE staining showed that the pathological changes of tumor tissues were most obvious in HBO+RSI group. After treatment, the MDA and Bax levels in nude mice of HBO+ RSI group were significantly higher than those in Cont group, HBO group and RSI group, but the levels of GSH, SOD and Bcl-2 were signifieandy lower than those of Cont group, HBO group and RSI group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Hyperbaric oxygen combined with radioactive seed implantation could slow tumor growth and increase survival time of tumor bearing mice. The possible mechanism is that hyperbaric oxygen combined with radioactive seed implantation can improve the oxidative stress response and the expression of apoptosis protein in tumor bearing nude mice.

Our analysis reveals that full-length BECN1 exists as a soluble homodimer (KD ∼ 0.45 μM) that interacts with Bcl-2 (KD = 4.3 ± 1.2 μM) and binds to lipid membranes. Dimerization is proposed to be mediated by a coiled-coil region of BECN1. A construct lacking the C-terminal BARA domain but including the coiled-coil region exhibits a homodimer KD 3.5-fold weaker than that of full-length BECN1, indicating that both the BARA domain and the coiled-coil region of BECN1 contribute to dimer formation. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that residues at the C-terminus of the coiled-coil region previously shown to interact with the BARA domain play a key role in dimerization and mutations weaken the interface by ∼5-fold. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,Article,Scopus

More than 90% of gastric cancer are considered as the ultimate consequence of a longstanding mucosal inflammation. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading etiological cause of gastritis, which may result in atrophy, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia of the gastric mucosa, and finally the occurrence of gastric cancer (Correa's Cascade of intestinal type of gastric cancer). This well-understood natural history provides the rationale for primary and secondary cancer prevention strategies. A large body of evidence demonstrates that combined strategies of primary (H. pylori eradication) and secondary (endoscopic screening and surveillance) prevention may prevent or limit the progress of gastric oncogenesis.

The effect of adjuvant chemotherapy (within postoperative 2 month, fluorine uracil as main drugs) on the prognosis of high-risk patients was analyzed. High risk factors were defined as having at least one of the following factors: (1) tumor stage T4; (2) poor differentiation; (3) with vascular cancer embolus; (4) number of harvested lymph node less than 12; (5) complicated with obstruction or perforation. RESULTS: A total of 497 patients with stage II( colon cancer were included in this study, of whom 258 cases(51.9%) had high risk factors, including stage T4 tumor in 80 cases(16.1%), poor differentiation in 80 cases (16.1%), cancer embolus in 37 cases (7.4%), lymph node harvested number less than 12 in 88 cases (17.7%), and obstruction or perforation in 85 cases (17.1%).

Predictors of peritoneal carcinomatosis were analyzed by univariate and Logistic multivariate analyses. Base on the independent predictors by multivariable analysis results, a nomogram model was formulated with further use of R software. The total score was calculated by the addition of each predictor score, indicating the corresponding risk of peritoneal metastasis. The score was greater in the nomogram, and the risk was higher in peritoneal implantation metastasis. A receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve was then constructed to evaluate the predictive abilities of the various preoperative factors and nomogram. RESULTS: A total of 1 417 patients were defined as above and enrolled in the study. The median age was (60.5±13.3) years, 835 cases (58.9%) were male, and 132 cases (9.3%, 132/1417) were diagnosed with synchronous peritoneal carcinomatosis during operation.

A time course study revealed that two injections of DMH given at an interval of one week resulted in appearance of multiple plaque lesions and aberrant crypt foci in the colon with a peak effect occurring at the end of 8 weeks. An efficacy study carried out with daily oral administration of artesunate (50 and 150 mg/kg) and aspirin (60 mg/kg) showed a marked reduction in pre-neoplastic changes with a significant decrease in the number of aberrant crypt foci, crypt multiplicity and restoration of histoarchitecture.

METHODS: Clinical data of 113 early colorectal mucosal carcinoma or submucosal carcinoma receiving endoscopic therapy were retrospectively analyzed and compared with 39 early colorectal cancer cases receiving surgery during the same time. RESULTS: All the cases were well-moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Size of tumors in endoscopic group was (26.2±21.5) mm, and that was (30.9±24.3) mm in surgery group (P=0.257). Baseline data between the two groups were not significantly different (all P>0.05). Significantly shorter median operating time [15.0 minutes vs. 203.0 minutes, χ2=69.322, P=0.000] and median hospital stay [3.0 days vs. 17.0 days, χ2=76.180, P=0.000] were observed in endoscopic group compared with surgery group. The en bloc resection rate, curative resection rate, lymph node metastatic rate and complication rate were not significantly different between two groups (all P>0.05). Ten patients in endoscopic group were referred to additional surgery for deep invasion and/or incomplete resection, of whom 7 received radical surgery, and the other 3 cases without radical surgery did not develop recurrence during follow-up of (20.5±0.9) months. After follow-up for (17.5±15.8) months, the local recurrence rate was 5.3% (6/113) in endoscopic group and 0 (0/39) in surgery group without significant difference (χ2=0.983, P=0.321). There was no significant difference in 5-year tumor-free survival rate between two groups (91.8% vs. 97.0%, χ2=1.533, P=0.216). CONCLUSION: Endoscopic therapy possesses shorter operating time, shorter hospital stay and similar efficacy as compared to surgery in the treatment of early colorectal cancer.",,Article,Scopus

Hence, arginine-depleting enzymes such as arginine deiminase (ADI) from Streptococcus pyogenes are promising for treatment of primary and maybe even refractory GBM. Based on our previous study in which ADI-susceptibility was shown on a panel of patient-derived GBM cell lines, we here aimed at deciphering underlying molecular mechanisms of ADI-mediated growth inhibition. We found that ADI (35 mU/mL) initially induces a cellular stress-response that is characterized by upregulation of genes primarily belonging to the heat-shock protein family. In addition to autophagocytosis, we show for the first time that senescence constitutes another cellular response mechanism upon ADI-treatment and that this bacterial enzyme is able to act as radiosensitizer (¼ cases). Long-term treatment schedules revealed no resistance development, with treated cells showing morphological signs of cell stress. Next, several combination strategies were employed to optimize ADI-based treatment. Simultaneous and sequential S. pyogenes ADI-based combinations included substances acting at different molecular pathways (curcumin, resveratrol, quinacrine, and sorafenib, 2 × 72 h treatment). Adding drugs to GBM cell lines (n = 4, including a matched pair of primary and recurrent GBM in one case) accelerated and potentiated ADI-mediated cytotoxicity. Autophagy was identified as the main cause of tumor growth inhibition. Of note, residual cells again showed classical signs of senescence in most combinations. Our results suggest an alternative treatment regimen for this fatal cancer type which circumvents many of the traditional barriers. Using the metabolic defect in GBM thus warrants further (pre-) clinical evaluation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Arginine-catabolizing enzymes; Cellular metabolism; Combination therapy; Patient-derived GBM cell lines; Radiation",Article,Scopus

Pirfenidone is an orally available small molecule with therapeutic potential for fibrotic diseases. Material/Methods: In this study, we analyzed the effects of different pirfenidone concentrations on the proliferation of HepG2 HCC cells using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays. Flow cytometry was performed to measure the apoptotic effects of pirfenidone on HepG2 cells. Western blot analysis was performed to detect the expression of β-catenin and p-β-catenin. Results: Pirfenidone inhibited proliferation and promoted HepG2 cell apoptosis. In addition, Western blot results indicated that pirfenidone suppressed β-catenin expression in HepG2 cells. To assess the mechanism, we treated HepG2 cells with pirfenidone, and pirfenidone plus the β-catenin activator, SB-216763. The results revealed that SB-216763 accelerated proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in HepG2 cells treated with pirfenidone.

Paralleled control study and random digital table were applied. Fifty-eight cases received the compound anastomotic device for protective ileostomy (anastomosis ring group) and 58 cases underwent traditional terminal ileostomy (traditional group). The compound device was mainly composed of Valtrac biodegradable anastomosis ring, drainage tube and condom. Operational procedure was as follows: Ileocecum was freed through incision following laparoscopic total mesorectal excision; Two intestinal ring-shape purses were made; Intestinal wall between purse string was cut and the compound anastomotic device was put into; The purse was tightened and anastomosis ring was closed; The compound device was embed and pull out through the Trocar hole in the right lower abdomen; Then the drainage tube was fixed to the abdominal wall and connected with a drainage bag or an outer pocket. Incidence of anastomotic leak, stoma-related complications, hospital stay and total cost of two groups were compared. RESULTS: The general clinical data between two groups were not significantly different(all P>0.05). Stoma operation was performed successfully in all the patients of two groups. The stoma operation time was (34.6±13.8) min in anastomosis ring group and (25.8±14.0) min in traditional group with significant difference (t=2.123, P=0.035).

LMP2A, a virus-encoded latent membrane protein is expressed in a portion of EBV-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC) and has been shown to be related with the tumorigenesis and progression of EBVaGC. Aims: To explore the effect of LMP2A silencing on growth of EBVaGC cells in vitro by using a lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit LMP2A gene expression. Methods: A lentivirus vector pGCSIL-LMP2A-shRNA-LV and a negative control vector were constructed and transfected into the EBVaGC cell line GT38. Real-time PCR and Western blotting were used to determine the inhibitory effect of the lentivirus vector; CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay and flow cytometry were employed to assess the cell growth, cell cycle and apoptosis of GT38 cells. Results: In GT38 cells transfected with LMP2A-shRNA-LV, the expression level of LMP2A mRNA was decreased by 65.4%, and that of LMP2A protein was reduced by 50.8%; the cell proliferation was inhibited, the colony formation ability was suppressed, the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase and apoptotic rate were increased when compared with those transfected with negative control vector or without transfection (P<0.05). Conclusions: Lentivirus-mediated RNAi is effective for silencing LMP2A gene expression, subsequently inhibiting the growth of EBVaGC cells, inducing G0/G1 phase arrest and enhancing cell apoptosis in vitro. LMP2A is supposed to be a potential target for gene therapy of EBVaGC.

Recent studies have shown that Cav-1 may play a critical role in response to DNA damage in irradiated pancreatic cancer cells. However, it is not known whether down-regulation of Cav-1 is required to enhance the damage of other kinds of human cells exposed to X-radiation. In this study, the role of Cav-1 in Chang liver cell line (CHL) exposed to X-radiation was investigated. Cav-1 knockdown cell line (CHL-CAV7) was stably established by the siRNA plasmids transfection, and Cav-1 expression was suppressed by 60%, compared with that of control group (CHL-C) which was transfected with non-targeting plasmids. Cellular survival ability and the expressions of proteins related to DNA damage and repair were examined by colony formation assay and Western blot, respectively. Down-regulation of Cav-1 expression induced a significant decrease of the survival rate in CHL-CAV7 cells exposed to 8 and 10 Gy X-radiation. Compared with CHL-C cells, CHL-CAV7 cells showed increased γH2AX expression, as well as decreased p-ATM, DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and p53 protein expressions when treated with X-radiation. Meanwhile, the colocalization of Mdm2 and Cav-1 was decreased in CHL-CAV7 cells compared with that in CHL-C cells. These results suggest that the down-regulation of Cav-1 may aggravate DNA damage of CHL cells through reducing the interaction of Cav-1 and Mdm2, which results in the promotion of p53 degradation.",,Article,Scopus

METHODS: Clinical data of 11 patients with presacral massive bleeding during pelvic operation at The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and 157 Branch Hospital of Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command from January 2001 to January 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. Hemostasis methods for presacral massive bleeding during operation included gauze packing (whole pressure), drawing pin (local pressure) and absorbable gauze (absorbable gauze was adhered to bleeding position with medical glue after local pressure). Efficacy of these 3 methods for controlling bleeding was evaluated and compared. RESULTS: Ten patients were male and 1 was female with average age of 65.2 (40 to 79) years old. Eight cases were rectal cancer, 2 were presacral malignancies and 1 was rectal benign lesion. Bleeding volume during operation was 300 to 2 500 (median 800) ml. From 2001 to 2012, 4 cases received gauze packing, of whom, 3 cases were scheduled Dixon resection before operation and then had to be referred to Hartman resection; 3 cases died of systemic failure due to postoperative chronic errhysis and infection, and 1 underwent re-operation.

Rats were divided into six groups and received modified pellet diet for 32 weeks. Group 1 served as control rats. Group 2 received AA (4 mg/kg b.w. p.o.). Group 3–6 rats received 15 DMH (20 mg/kg b.w., s.c.) injections once a week starting from the 4th week. Besides DMH, rats received AA (4 mg/kg b.w. p.o.) in group 4 starting 2 weeks before carcinogen treatment till the end of the last DMH; group 5 starting 2 days after last DMH till the end of the experiment; and group 6 throughout the experiment. Pre-neoplastic lesions, xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, inflammation, cell proliferation and apoptotic markers were analysed in our study. Our results ascertained AA supplementation to DMH-exposed rats significantly decreased the incidence of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and phase I xenobiotic enzymes; and increased the phase II xenobiotic enzymes and mucin content as compared to DMH-alone-exposed rats. Moreover the increased expressions of mast cells, argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cyclin D1 observed in the DMH-alone-exposed rats were reverted and were comparable with those of the control rats, when treated with AA. Concordantly AA also induced apoptosis by downregulating the expression of Bcl-2 and upregulating Bax, cytochrome c, caspase-3 and -9 in the DMH-alone-exposed rats. Thus AA was able to inhibit DMH-induced colon carcinogenesis by detoxifying the carcinogen, decreasing the preneoplastic lesions by virtue of its anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects. Therefore our findings suggest that AA could be used as an effective chemopreventive agent against DMH induced colon carcinogenesis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","1,2- dimethylhydrazine; Albino Wistar rats; Asiatic acid; Cell proliferation; Chemoprevention; Colon cancer",Article,Scopus

The complex 2 (IC50 = 8.5 ± 0.4/SI = 6.3) showed high cytotoxic and selectivity index against EAC cells than complex 1 (IC50 = 14.9 ± 0.2/SI = 0.2) using the MTT assay. Complex 2 induced DNA damage on Ehrlich tumor cells at concentrations and time periods evalueted. In consequence, it was observed an increase of Tp53 gene expression, G0/G1-arrest cells, and increased levels of cleaved PARP protein. Beside that, the treatment of EAC with complex 2 led to an increase in Annexin V-positive cells and apoptosis induction by Caspase-7. Additionally, the complex 2 inhibited the angiogenesis caused by Ehrlich tumor cells in CAM model.

Methods: The clinical manifestations, neuroimaging, histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular genetic features were retrospectively analyzed in one case of sellar/suprasellar extraventricular neurocytoma, and the related literatures were reviewed. Results: A 27-year-old female presented with intermittent headache, accompanied by blurred vision for 5 months. Head MRI demonstrated a mass with a well-defined margin measuring 3.80 cm × 2.50 cm × 3.40 cm located in the sellar/suprasellar region. The tumor showed isointense to hyperintense signals on T1WI and hyper-hypointense mixed signals on T2WI, and slightly hyperintense signal on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The pituitary was not shown. A transsphenoidal sellar tumor resection, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea repairing and optic decompression were performed. The mass was lightly yellow and tough with abundant blood supply and filled with old hemorrhage. The pituitary tissue was pushed to the left rear. Microscopy examination showed a diffuse invasive growth pattern with neuropil background in some area. The tumor cells were uniform on size and shape with round to oval, exquisite and hyperchromatic nuclei. No mitosis was found. Immunohistochemical staining showed the tumor cells were positive for neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) in nuclei, calretinin (CR) in nuclei and cytoplasm, synaptophysin (Syn), chromogranin A (CgA), E-cadherin, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in cytoplasm, and focally positive for S-100 protein (S-100) in nuclei, and neurofilament protein (NF), cytokeratin 8 (CK8) and vimentin (Vim) in cytoplasm. The Ki-67 labeling index was about 3%. The tumor tissue was negative for reticular fiber staining. Molecular genetic analysis showed that isocitrate dehydrogenasel (IDH) gene was not mutated, and 1p/19q was intact in tumor cells. The final pathological diagnosis was extraventricular neurocytoma, WHO grade II. Conclusions: Extraventricular neurocytoma located in the sellar/suprasellar region is very rare. The histological features are similar to central neurocytoma in ventricle. Tumor cells were in diffusely invasive growth and were uniform in size and shape, with round nuclei. Fibrillary areas mimicking neurophil and branching thin-walled capillaries can be seen. The differential diagnosis includes pituitary adenoma, oligodendroglioma, clear cell ependymoma, and so on.

However, the mechanism of PCAT7 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been identified. Hence, this study aimed to determine the function of PCAT7 in NSCLC. Material/Methods: The expression level of PCAT7 in 96 pairs of NSCLC tissues and 6 cell lines was detected by qRT-PCR. Proliferation assay, flow cytometric analysis, transwell/migration assay, and Western blotting assay were performed to detect the relation between PCAT7 and malignant behaviors of NSCLC cells in vitro, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Rescue assays were carried out to confirm the contribution of PCAT7 to the progression of NSCLC cells by targeting miR-134-5p. Results: PCAT7 was found to be overexpressed in NSCLC tissues (compared with corresponding non-tumor tissues) and NSCLC cells (compared with normal cell line 16-HBE). Overexpression of PCAT7 resulted in the promotion of tumor cell proliferation, inhibition of cells apoptosis, facilitation of cells metastasis, and formation of EMT phenotype, while PCAT7 expression deletion remarkably prohibited cell proliferation, accelerated their apoptosis, weakened metastasis, and reversed EMT to MET. miR-134-5P, as a target gene of PCAT7, restored the effects of down-regulation of PCAT7. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that PCAT7 participates in tumor progression in NSCLC by inhibiting miR-134-5p. © Med Sci Monit, 2017.","Carcinogenesis; Carcinoma; Long noncoding; MicroRNAs; Non-small-cell lung; RNA",Article,Scopus

Understanding alterations in the immune systems of pancreatic cancer patients will likely lead to advances in immunotherapy for the disease. We profiled peripheral blood leukocytes from pancreatic cancer patients (n D 22) and age-matched controls (n D 20) using flow cytometry. Immune profiling of pancreatic cancer patients identified phenotypic changes in various immune cell populations, including a population of immunosuppressive monocytes (CD14 + HLA-DR lo/neg ), which were shown to be increased in these patients. There was a correlation between the levels of CD14 + monocytes and the levels of CD14 + HLA-DR lo/neg monocytes in peripheral blood from pancreatic cancer patients. HLA-DR downregulation of monocytes was shown to occur through pancreatic cancer-derived exosome interactions with monocytes. In an in vitro model, exosomes from patient-derived xenograft cell lines and patient plasma decreased HLA-DR expression on CD14 + monocytes. Additionally, tumor-derived exosomes caused immune suppression in monocytes through altered STAT3 signaling, induction of arginase expression, and reactive oxygen species. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms that govern immunosuppression in pancreatic cancer.

Methods: According to the Expert Scheme proposed the Expert Committee of Early Detection and Early Treatment, China Cancer Foundation, diagnostical screening by using combined methods of alpha-fetoprotein and B ultrasound monitoring were carried out biannually in individuals with positive HBsAg who were screened from Qidong area. The evaluation indices of the effectiveness are task completion rate of screening, detection rate of liver cancer, early diagnosis rate, and treatment rate. The deadline of the follow-up for the surviving outcome was March 31, 2016. The life-table method was used to calculate the observed survival, and to make comparison and significant tests between survival rates in Group A (those found via repeated periodic screening) and Group B (those diagnosed without periodic screening). Results: Since 2007, 38 016 target population have been screened, and 3 703(9.74%) individuals with positive HBsAg were found. Except for 29 patients with liver cancer at the initial screening, 3 674 persons in the cohort were followed up; 268 patients with liver cancer were detected from the 33 199 person-times screening, with an annual detection rate of 1.61%. Of them, 186 patients were found in Group A(1.12%), in which 149 patients were the early cases, with an early detection rate of 80.11%; 167 out of 186(89.78%) patients received treatment after diagnosis. The incidence of liver cancer in this HBsAg (+ ) cohort of 25 452 person-years was 1 052.96 per 100 000 annually, 187 cases in males(1 488.45/100 000)and 81 cases in females(628.46/100 000). The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 8-year survival of all patients with liver cancer were 64.55%, 40.50%, 32.54%, and 19.65%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 8-year survival rates were 77.16%, 49.04%, 38.53%, and 24.25% in Group A, and were 36.25%, 21.21%, 21.21%, and 0% in Group B, respectively, with significant differences between two groups (P<0.05). Conclusion: The findings show that screening of individuals at high-risk of development of liver cancer, with semiannual AFP and B ultrasound, according to the Expert Scheme, is effective not only in increasing detection rate but also in detecting liver cancer at early stage, and in improving patients' survival as well.","Follow-up; HBsAg; Liver neoplasms; Screening; Secondary prevention; Survival",Article,Scopus

Further progress requires deeper insights into the biology of immune cells in the lung cancer micro-environment. Dendritic cells (DCs) represent a heterogeneous and highly plastic immune cell system with a central role in controlling immune responses. The intratumoral infiltration and activation status of DCs are emerging as clinically relevant parameters in lung cancer. In this study, we used an orthotopic preclinical model of lung cancer to dissect how the lung tumor micro-environment affects tissue-resident DCs and extract novel biologically and clinically relevant information. Lung tumor-infiltrating leukocytes expressing generic DC markers were found to predominantly consist of CD11bC cells that, compare with peritumoral lung DC counterparts, strongly overexpress the T-cell inhibitory molecule PD-L1 and acquire classical surface markers of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Transcriptome analysis of these CD11bC tumor-infiltrating DCs (TIDCs) indicates impaired antitumoral immunogenicity, confirms the skewing toward TAM-related features, and indicates exposure to a hypoxic environment. In parallel, TIDCs display a specific microRNA (miRNA) signature dominated by the prototypical lung cancer oncomir miR-31. In vitro, hypoxia drives intrinsic miR-31 expression in CD11bC DCs. Conditioned medium of miR-31 overexpressing CD11bC DCs induces pro-invasive lung cancer cell shape changes and is enriched with pro-metastatic soluble factors. Finally, analysis of TCGA datasets reveals that the TIDC-associated miRNA signature has a negative prognostic impact in non-small cell lung cancer.

Administration of the peptide resulted in a significant decrease in the development of intestinal polyps in C57BL/6J-ApcMin mice, a model of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). In addition, even though they were not vaccinated, ApcMin offspring born to vaccinated females developed significantly fewer polyps than offspring born to control females.

These studies reveal possibility of generating PD-1-disrupted CTL by CRISPR-Cas9 system and demonstrate enhanced immune response of these PD-1-disrupted CTLs to the EBV-LMP2A antigen and superior cytotoxicity to the EBV-positive gastric cancer cell. In addition, when combined with low-dose radiotherapy, these PD-1-disrupted CTLs mediated an impressive antitumor effect in a xenograft mouse model of EBVaGC. Taken together, these studies illustrate PD-1/PD-L1-mediated immune tolerance of EBVaGC and provide a new strategy for targeting immune checkpoints to break the tolerance for the T cell-based adoptive therapy. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adoptive cell therapy; Checkpoint blockade; CRISPR; EBV-associated gastric cancer",Article,Scopus

Since activated T lymphocytes may serve as a hallmark for anticancer responses, we targeted these cells using the radiotracer N-(4-[18F]fluorobenzoyl)-interleukin-2 ([18F]FB-IL-2) for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Thus, we noninvasively monitored the effects of local tumor irradiation and/or immunization on tumor-infiltrating and systemic activated lymphocytes in tumor-bearing mice. A 10- and 27-fold higher [18F]FB-IL-2 uptake was observed in tumors of mice receiving tumor irradiation alone or in combination with immunization, respectively. This increased uptake was extended to several non-target tissues. Administration of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 reduced tracer uptake by 2.8-fold, indicating a CXCR4-dependent infiltration of activated T lymphocytes upon cancer treatment. In conclusion, [18F]FB-IL-2 PET can serve as a clinical biomarker to monitor treatment-induced infiltration of activated T lymphocytes and, on that basis, may guide cancer immunotherapies. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","18[F]FB-IL-2; Activated T lymphocytes; Immunotherapy; Interleukin-2; Molecular imaging; PET; Radiation",Article,Scopus

Here, we demonstrate that cancer cells succumbing to HHP induce CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-dependent protective immunity in vivo. Moreover, we show that cell death induction by HHP relies on the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing rapid establishment of the integrated stress response, eIF2α phosphorylation by PERK, and sequential caspase-2, –8 and –3 activation. Non-phosphorylatable eIF2α, depletion of PERK, caspase-2 or –8 compromised calreticulin exposure by cancer cells succumbing to HHP but could not inhibit death. Interestingly, the phagocytosis of HHP-treated malignant cells by dendritic cells was suppressed by the knockdown of caspase-2 in the former. Thus, caspase-2 mediates a key function in the interaction between dying cancer cells and antigen presenting cells. Our results indicate that the ROS→PERK→eIF2α→caspase-2 signaling pathway is central for the perception of HHP-driven cell death as immunogenic. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Caspases; Ecto-CALR; ER stress; High hydrostatic pressure; Immunogenic cell death",Article,Scopus

The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between PD-1/PD-L1 expression and CAS prognosis. CAS cases (n D 106) were immunohistochemically studied for PD-L1 and PD-1 expression, and the correlation with patient prognosis was analyzed. PD-L1 expression was assessed by flow cytometry on three CAS cell lines with or without IFNg stimulation. A total of 30.2% of patients’ samples were positive for PD-L1, and 17.9% showed a high infiltration of PD-1-positive cells. Univariate analysis showed a significant relationship between a high infiltration of PD-1-positive cells with tumor site PD-L1 expression and favorable survival in stage 1 patients (p D 0.014, log-rank test). Multivariable Cox-proportional hazard regression analysis also showed that patients with a high infiltration of PD-1-positive cells with tumor site PD-L1 expression were more likely to have favorable survival, after adjustment with possible confounders (hazard ratio (HR) D 0.38, p D 0.021, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16–0.86). Immunofluorescence staining of CAS samples revealed that PD-L1-positive cells were adjacent to PD-1-positive cells and/or tumor stroma with high IFNγ expression. In vitro stimulation with IFNγ increased PD-L1 expression in two out of three established CAS cell lines. Our results suggest that PD-1/PD-L1 expression is related to CAS progression, and the treatment with anti- PD-1 antibodies could be a new therapeutic option for CAS. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cutaneous angiosarcoma; IFNγ; PD-1; PD-L1; T cells",Article,Scopus

We report the case of a patient who developed pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy with alveolar hemorrhage. Almost all patients with pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy die within 1 week of the onset of dyspnea; however, the prognosis in this case was better, with 10 weeks of survival from presentation. Case presentation: A 62-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital with a 4-week history of dyspnea on exertion and severe pulmonary hypertension. Five years previously, he had undergone distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. He was afebrile, normotensive, and hypoxemic. A physical examination was unremarkable except for purpura on his upper extremities and trunk. Blood tests showed anemia and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Chest computed tomography revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities with emphysema in his upper lungs, moderate pleural effusions, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and enlargement of the right ventricle and main pulmonary artery. A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Lung perfusion scintigraphy showed multiple segmental defects. Although recurrence of gastric cancer was confirmed from the results of bone marrow biopsy, bronchoscopy was not performed due to bleeding diathesis. He was treated with corticosteroids, antibiotics, and platelet transfusion, following which resolution of the abnormal lung shadows and right ventricular pressure overload along with partial alleviation of respiratory failure was observed. Because of his poor performance status, he was eventually transited to palliative care and died 6 weeks after admission. Necropsy of the lung confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy with alveolar hemorrhage. Conclusions: Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with cancer who present with severe pulmonary hypertension. In pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy, local inflammation in pulmonary microvasculature may contribute to pulmonary hypertension, and regulation of inflammation using corticosteroids may help improve the prognosis. © 2017 The Author(s).","Pulmonary embolism; Pulmonary hypertension; Rare lung diseases",Article,Scopus

Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) is an important component of precise therapy for lung cancer patients. EGFR mutations occur mainly in exon 18 to 21, in which exon 19 deletion and exon 21 L858R point mutation that are known as sensitive mutations account for nearly 45% and 40%, respectively. Except for the above two mutations and T790M point mutation, the rest are rare mutations, including Ins19, Ins20, E709, G719, S768, L861 and some compound mutations. Some previous retrospective studies of small sample size and case reports showed that most of EGFR exon19 (Ins), exon 21 (L861), exon 18 (G719X) and exon20 (S768I) mutations were sensitive to TKIs. And although the exon 20 insertion mutation is usually predicted to the first and second generations of EGFR-TKIs resistance, some specific types are sensitive to the third generation of EGFR-TKIs. Currently, targeted drugs for Ins20 -Ap32788 mutation has entered into clinical trials. Patients with complex mutations have similar efficacy on EGFR-TKIs in comparison with those with single sensitivity mutations. In conclusion, when patients with rare sensitive mutations received EGFR-TKIs therapy, the efficacy and progression-free survival time is similar to or slightly lower than those with classical sensitive mutations, whereas it is higher than those with wild-type EGFR. Compared with the first generation of EGFR-TKIs, second generation EGFR-TKIs may be more suitable for the treatment of lung cancer patients harboring rare sensitive EGFR mutations.","Epidermal growth factor receptor; Lung neoplasms; Precise therapy; Rare sensitive mutation; Tyrosine kinase inhibitor",Article,Scopus

Methods: Clinical data of 34 patients with rectal cancer were prospective analyzed. Conventional MRI sequences, IVIM DWI-MRI with sixteen b values and dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE)-MRI sequences of rectum were acquired by GE 3.0-T MRI imager. The IVIM sequence images with b value=1000 sec/mm(2) were selected to measure the maximum axial section of tumor by a radiologist with 15 year-experiences in gastrointestinal cancer imaging.Two radiologists (radiologist 1 and radiologist 2 with 2 and 10 years of experience in gastrointestinal cancer imaging, respectively) independently draw a freehand region of interest (ROI) that contained the largest available tumor area on the selected section. Monoexponential apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and biexponential IVIM metrics maps and IVIM parameters were generated automatically by the software. The repeated measurement was performed at an interval of one week. The average values of each measurement were used for statistical analysis. ADC values and IVIM parameters obtained between- and within- radiologists were analyzed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altaman plots were used to analyze the parameter reproducibility of two measurements between- and within- radiologists. Results: The first and second measured ADC (×10(-3)mm(2)/s), true diffusivity (D, ×10(-3)mm(2)/s), false diffusivity (D(*,) mm(2)/s) and perfusion fraction (f, %) by radiologist 1 were 0.997, 0.692, 0.043, 34.6 and 0.993, 0.691, 0.038, 32.8, respectively. The first and second measured ADC (×10(-3)mm(2)/s), D (×10(-3)mm(2)/s), D(*) (mm(2)/s), f (%) by radiologist 2 were 0.987, 0.651, 0.046, 32.8 and 0.996, 0.689、0.041, 32.7, respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed in ADC and IVIM parameters obtained between- and within- radiologists (P>0.05). The ADC values and the f values of two times were significantly correlated between- and within- radiologists. The D values were significantly correlated within a radiologist, and the correlation of D(*) values within a radiologist was significantly higher than that between radiologists. The 95% limits of agreement (LoA) of ADC values and f values were smaller than those of D values and D(*) values between- and within- radiologists. The 95% LoA of ADC values was the least, while that of D(*) values varied most.The 95% LoA of f values and D values kept steady within a radiologist, and 95% LoA of f values was slightly smaller than that of D values. The 95% LoA of IVIM parameters (ADC, D, f, D(*) values) within radiologists 2 were better than those within radiologist 1. Conclusions: The reproducibilities of ADC and f values are the best, while the reproducibility of D(*) values is relatively poorer in rectal cancer. Measurement reproducibility of parameters derived from IVIM may be improved by increasing radiologists' experiences in drawing ROI.","Introvoxel incoherent movement; Magnetic resonance Imaging; Rectal neoplasms; Reproducibility",Article,Scopus

In the FAS, the clinical effective rate in the treatment group was 68.3%, significantly superior than 41.7% of the control group (P=0.003). The medium time of effective therapy in the treatment group was 8 days, significantly shorter than 10 days in the control group (P=0.017). In the FAS, 3 adverse events occurred in the treatment group, including mild to moderate decrustation, pruritus and nausea. The incidence rate of adverse events was 5.0% (3/60) and these symptoms were spontaneously remitted after drug withdrawal. No severe adverse events were observed in the control group. There was no significant difference between these two groups (P=0.244). Conclusion: Weitan Waifu patch is a safely and effectively therapeutic method for patients with PGS (cold syndrome) of gastroenterological cancer.

Methods: Clinical data of 48 patients over 70 years of age with medial wall pyriform sinus cancer who received surgical treatment from January 2001 to December 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. Among them, 21 cases were given preoperative radiotherapy and surgery (R+ S). The radiation therapy dose was 45 Gy. And 14 cases' larynx is preserved. In addition, 27 cases were given postoperative radiotherapy and surgery (S+ R). The radiation therapy dose was 65 Gy. And 10 cases had preserved laryngeal function. Survival rates were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Chi-square test was used to compare complications between two groups. Results: The larynx preservation rate in R+ S group [66.7% (14/21)] was significantly higher than that in S+ R group [37.0% (10/27), P<0.05]. The complication rate and decannulation rate in R+ S group were 42.9% (9/21) and 64.3% (9/14), respectively, showing no difference compared with those in S+ R group [37.0% (10/27) and 50.0% (5/10), respectively] (all P>0.05). The complication rates of patients with and without larynx preservation were 41.7% (10/24) and 37.5% (9/24), respectively, showing no difference between two groups (P>0.05). The overall 3-years and 5-years survival rates for all patients were 54.2% (26/48) and 35.4% (17/48), respectively. There was no significant difference in survival rates between R+ S [38.1% (8/21)] group and S+ R group [33.3% (9/27), P>0.05)]. In the R+ S group, the survival rates in patients with and without larynx preservation were 40.0% (4/10) and 29.4% (5/17), respectively, showing no significant difference between two groups (P>0.05). Conclusions: It is secure and effective to choose the operation with laryngeal preservation for patient over 70 years of age with medial wall pyriform sinus cancer based on their physical conditions and the tumor extension. The preoperative- and postoperative-radiotherapy have the similar effect. Preoperative radiotherapy and surgery increases the laryngeal preservation rate.","Laryngectomy; Pharyngeal neoplasms; Pharyngectomy; Treatment outcome",Article,Scopus

Although osteopontin (SPP1) has been associated with tumor dissemination, the role of its isoforms in lung-directed metastasis is incompletely understood. We employed syngeneic mouse models of spontaneous and induced lung-targeted metastasis in C57BL/6 mice competent and deficient in both Spp1 alleles. Tumorderived osteopontin expression was modulated using either stable anti-Spp1 RNA interference, or forced overexpression of intracellular and secreted Spp1 isoforms. Identified osteopontin’s downstream partners were validated using lung adenocarcinoma cells conditionally lacking the Trp53 gene and Ccr2-deficient mice. We determined that host-derived osteopontin was dispensable for pulmonary colonization by different tumor types. Oppositely, tumor-originated intracellular osteopontin promoted tumor cell survival by preventing tumor-related protein 53-mediated apoptosis, while the secretory osteopontin functioned in a paracrine mode to accelerate lung metastasis by enhancing tumor-derived C–C-motif chemokine ligand 2 signaling to cognate host receptors. As new ways to target osteopontin signaling are becoming available, the cytokine may constitute an important therapeutic target against pulmonary involvement by cancers of other organs. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","C–C-motif chemokine ligand 2; Inflammation and cancer; Secreted phosphoprotein 1; Spontaneous lung metastasis; Tumor-related protein 53",Article,Scopus

Methods: The serum of 132 cases with cisplatin-resistant EOC, cisplatin-sensitive EOC, benign ovarian cyst and healthy donors were collected. Differentially plasma metabolic profiles were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The significantly different metabolites of each group were screened by using principal component analysis. Then compounds that played a key role in cisplatin resistance were identified by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The relationships between these compounds and clinical characteristics and prognosis were analyzed. Results: LC-MS/MS identified 25 800 metabolic compounds. According to the descending dimension algorithm by principal component analysis, six compounds which were the biggest contributor to grouping were identified. The identified results of NMR showed that the serum level of C16 Sphinganine was lower while Dodemorph was higher in the EOC than those of the normal control. Compared to the cisplatin sensitive group, cisplatin resistant group exhibited a specific metabolic trait characterized by upregulation of 1-Monopalmitin, Ricinoleic acid methyl ester, Polyoxyethylene (600) mono-ricinoleate/Glycidyl stearate and downregulation of Calycanthidine. The four components were all associated with fatty acid metabolism, and the combinational diagnostic sensitivity of these biomarkers for cisplatin-resistance was 86.50% and the specificity was 81.80%, the area of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.93. Conclusions: The metabolic signatures of normal control, benign ovarian cyst, cisplatin sensitivity and cisplatin resistance can be clearly separated from each other by LC-MS/MS technology.The combinational four biomarkers including Calycanthidine, 1-Monopalmitin, Ricinoleic acid methl ester and Polyoxyethylene (600) mono-ricinoleate/Glycidyl stearate are more sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of cisplatin resistant EOC, and may provide the potentially predict markers of chemotherapeutic response in metabolic level. The fatty acid metabolism may participate in the cisplatin resistant progression of EOC.","Biomarkers; Chemo-resistance; Metabolomics; Ovarian neoplasms",Article,Scopus

However, a lack of binding pockets on the surface of RAS and its picomolar affinity for guanine nucleotides have made isolation of inhibitors particularly challenging. We recently described a monobody, termed NS1, that blocks RAS signaling and oncogenic transformation. NS1 binds to the α4-β6-α5 interface of H-RAS and K-RAS thus preventing RAS dimerization and nanoclustering, which in turn prevents RAS-stimulated dimerization and activation of RAF. Interestingly, NS1 reduces interaction of oncogenic K-RAS, but not H-RAS, with RAF and reduces K-RAS plasma membrane localization. Here, we show that these isoform specific effects of NS1 on RAS:RAF are due to the distinct hypervariable regions of RAS isoforms. NS1 inhibited wild type RAS function by reducing RAS GTP levels. These findings reveal that NS1 disrupts RAS signaling through a mechanism that is more complex than simply inhibiting RAS dimerization and nanoclustering. © 2017 Taylor & Francis","H-RAS; K-RAS; NS1 monobody; RAS chimera; RAS dimerization; RAS inhibitor; RAS nanoclustering",Article in Press,Scopus

Individual patients might be cured with less burdensome therapy. We investigated whether metabolic response determined by PET after two cycles of standard regimen eBEACOPP (PET-2) would allow adaption of treatment intensity, increasing it for PET-2-positive patients and reducing it for PET-2-negative patients. Methods In this open-label, randomised, parallel-group phase 3 trial, we recruited patients aged 18–60 years with newly diagnosed, advanced-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma in 301 hospitals and private practices in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, and the Czech Republic. After central review of PET-2, patients were assigned (1:1) to one of two parallel treatment groups on the basis of their PET-2 result. Patients with positive PET-2 were randomised to receive six additional cycles of either standard eBEACOPP (8 × eBEACOPP in total) or eBEACOPP with rituximab (8 × R-eBEACOPP). Those with negative PET-2 were randomised between standard treatment with six additional cycles of eBEACOPP (8 × eBEACOPP) or experimental treatment with two additional cycles (4 × eBEACOPP). A protocol amendment in June, 2011, introduced a reduction of standard therapy to 6 × eBEACOPP; after this point, patients with positive PET-2 were no longer randomised and were all assigned to receive 6 × eBEACOPP and patients with negative PET-2 were randomly assigned to 6 × eBEACOPP (standard) or 4 × eBEACOPP (experimental). Randomisation was done centrally using the minimisation method including a random component, stratified according to centre, age (&lt;45 vs ≥45 years), stage (IIB, IIIA vs IIIB, IV), international prognostic score (0–2 vs 3–7), and sex. eBEACOPP was given as previously described; rituximab was given intravenously at a dose of 375 mg/m2 (maximum total dose 700 mg). The primary objectives were to show superiority of the experimental treatment in the PET-2-positive cohort, and to show non-inferiority of the experimental treatment in the PET-2-negative cohort in terms of the primary endpoint, progression-free survival. We defined non-inferiority as an absolute difference of 6% in the 5-year progression-free survival estimates. Primary analyses in the PET-2-negative cohort were per protocol; all other analyses were by intention to treat. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00515554. Findings Between May 14, 2008, and July 18, 2014, we recruited 2101 patients, of whom 137 were found ineligible before randomisation and a further 19 were found ineligible after randomisation. Among 434 randomised patients (217 per arm) with positive PET-2, 5-year progression-free survival was 89·7% (95% CI 85·4–94·0) with eBEACOPP and 88·1% (83·5–92·7) with R-eBEACOPP (log-rank p=0·46). Patients with negative PET-2 randomly assigned to either 8 × eBEACOPP or 6 × eBEACOPP (n=504) or 4 × eBEACOPP (n=501) had 5-year progression-free survival of 90·8% (95% CI 87·9–93·7) and 92·2% (89·4–95·0), respectively (difference 1·4%, 95% CI −2·7 to 5·4). 4 × eBEACOPP was associated with fewer severe infections (40 [8%] of 498 vs 75 [15%] of 502) and organ toxicities (38 [8%] of 498 vs 91 [18%] of 502) than were 8 × eBEACOPP or 6 × eBEACOPP in PET-2-negative patients. Ten treatment-related deaths occurred: four in the PET-2-positive cohort (one [&lt;1%] in the 8 × eBEACOPP group, three [1%] in the 8 × R-eBEACOPP group) and six in the PET-2-negative group (six [1%] in the 8 × eBEACOPP or 6 × eBEACOPP group). Interpretation The favourable outcome of patients treated with eBEACOPP could not be improved by adding rituximab after positive PET-2. PET-2 negativity allows reduction to only four cycles of eBEACOPP without loss of tumour control. PET-2-guided eBEACOPP provides outstanding efficacy for all patients and increases overall survival by reducing treatment-related risks for patients with negative PET-2. We recommend this PET-2-guided treatment strategy for patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Pigs at least six years of age were statistically more likely to have a uterine lesion (less than P=0.001). Smooth muscle tumours represented the most frequent neoplasm. Haemorrhage was the most common intraoperative complication in 23 per cent (8/34) of pigs with neoplasia. Pigs without reproductive tract lesions were statistically more likely to survive to hospital discharge than those with lesions (P=0.001). Short-term survival, defined as survival to hospital discharge, of pigs with reproductive tract lesions was 89 per cent (48/54). Pigs with pyometra were least likely to survive to discharge 60 per cent (3/5). Long-term survival (≥1 year) was 93 per cent (14/15) for pigs with neoplasia. Practitioners should be aware of significantly higher rate of neoplastic and inflammatory diseases in PBP at least six years of age. To minimise morbidity and mortality in PBP undergoing OVH, the present study suggests the procedure should be performed prior to six years of age. © British Veterinary Association (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

Methods: A total of 845 HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy from 1999 to 2010 at Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences were retrospectively analyzed. 21 common clinical factors were selected in this analysis. Among these factors, the cut-off values of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and intraoperative blood loss were evaluated by using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model were used to evaluate the independent risk factors associated with the prognosis of HCC patients after hepatectomy. HCC postoperatively prognostic scoring system was established according to the minimum weighted method of these independent risk factors, and divided the patients into 3 risk groups, including low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk group. The relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared among these groups. Results: The univariate analysis showed that clinical symptoms, preoperative α-fetoprotein (AFP) level, serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level, tumor size, tumor number, abdominal lymph node metastasis, macrovascular invasion or tumor thrombus, extrahepatic invasion or serosa perforation, the severity of hepatic cirrhosis, intraoperative blood loss, the liver operative method, pathological tumor thrombus, intraoperative blood transfusion, perioperative blood transfusion were significantly associated with median RFS of these HCC patients (P<0.05). Alternatively, clinical symptoms, preoperative AFP level, serum ALP level, tumor size, tumor number, abdominal lymph node metastasis, macrovascular invasion or tumor thrombus, extrahepatic invasion or serosa perforation, the severity of hepatic cirrhosis, intraoperative blood loss, the liver operative method, pathological lymphocyte invasion, pathological tumor thrombus, intraoperative blood transfusion, perioperative blood transfusion were significantly associated with the median OS of these HCC patients (P<0.05). The multivariate analysis showed that AFP ≥20 ng/ml, clinical symptoms, tumor diameter ≥5 cm, multiple tumors, macrovascular invasion or tumor thrombus, extrahepatic invasion or serosa perforation, moderate and severe liver cirrhosis, non- anatomic resection were the independent risk factors of RFS and OS (P<0.05). The independent risk factor of RFS was intraoperative bleeding loss ≥325 ml (P<0.05); The independent risk factors of OS were abdominal lymph node metastasis and pathological tumors thrombus (P<0.05). The respective weight of 11 independent factors was used to establish the scoring system (scores range from 0 to 26). In the score system, 0 to 5 points were defined as the low-risk group (286 cases), 6 to 12 points were determined as the intermediate-risk group (503 cases), more than 13 points were classified as the high-risk group (56 cases). The median RFS of the low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk group were 80, 27 and 6 months, respectively. The differences were statistically significant (P<0.001). The median OS of the three groups were 134, 51 and 15 months, respectively, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.001). Conclusion: This new score system provides effective prediction of postoperative prognosis for HCC patients.","Hepatectomy; Liver neoplasms; Prognosis; Prognostic score system",Article,Scopus

This necessitates identification and validation of novel targets. Suppression of Popeye domain-containing protein 1 (POPDC1) is known to promote tumorigenesis and correlate to poor clinical outcomes in various cancers, and also promotes cardiac and skeletal muscle pathologies. It remains to be established whether POPDC1 is dysregulated in breast cancer, and whether overcoming the dysregulation of POPDC1 could present a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit breast tumorigenesis. We assessed the potential of POPDC1 as a novel target for inhibiting breast cancer cell migration and proliferation. POPDC1 was significantly suppressed with reduced cell membrane localization in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, functional suppression of POPDC1 promoted breast cancer cell migration and proliferation, which were inhibited by POPDC1 overexpression. Finally, cAMP interacts with POPDC1 and up-regulates its expression in breast cancer cells. These findings suggest that POPDC1 plays a role in breast tumorigenesis and represents a potential therapeutic target or biomarker in breast cancer medicine. © 2017 The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

It has been reported that CTNNB1 polymorphisms are associated with cancer risk. However, the data were inconsistent. In this article, we conducted a systematic review for the researches related to the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CTNNB1 with overall cancer risk. Meanwhile, a series of inclusion and exclusion criteria were set to select articles for quantitative analysis. Consequently, eight case-control studies containing 4388 cases and 4477 controls were included in a meta-analysis of four highly studied CTNNB1 SNPs (rs1798802 A/G, rs4135385 A/G, rs11564475 A/G, and rs2293303 C/T). The association between each SNP and cancer risk was estimated by calculating odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). The results showed rs1798802 (AA compared with GG: P=0.044, OR=0.72) and rs2293303 (TT compared with CC: P=0.002, OR=2.86; recessive model: P=0.006, OR=2.91; T compared with C: P=0.004, OR=1.19) polymorphisms were associated with overall cancer risk. In stratified analysis, rs4135385 polymorphism was found to elevate the risk in Caucasian or in gastrointestinal cancer subgroup. Additionally, rs2293303 conferred to an increased cancer risk when the source of control groups was hospital-based (HB). In conclusion, the three CTNNB1 SNPs were suggested to have the potential to be novel biomarkers for risk prediction of cancer in overall population or some specific subgroups.

Aberrant circulating DNA methylation (DNAme) patterns are likely to provide a highly specific cancer signal. We hypothesized that cell-free DNAme markers could indicate disseminated breast cancer, even in the presence of substantial quantities of background DNA. Methods: We used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) of 31 tissues and established serum assays based on ultra-high coverage bisulfite sequencing in two independent prospective serum sets (n = 110). The clinical use of one specific region, EFC#93, was validated in 419 patients (in both pre- and post-adjuvant chemotherapy samples) from SUCCESS (Simultaneous Study of Gemcitabine-Docetaxel Combination adjuvant treatment, as well as Extended Bisphosphonate and Surveillance-Trial) and 925 women (pre-diagnosis) from the UKCTOCS (UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening) population cohort, with overall survival and occurrence of incident breast cancer (which will or will not lead to death), respectively, as primary endpoints. Results: A total of 18 BC specific DNAme patterns were discovered in tissue, of which the top six were further tested in serum. The best candidate, EFC#93, was validated for clinical use. EFC#93 was an independent poor prognostic marker in pre-chemotherapy samples (hazard ratio [HR] for death = 7.689) and superior to circulating tumor cells (CTCs) (HR for death = 5.681). More than 70% of patients with both CTCs and EFC#93 serum DNAme positivity in their pre-chemotherapy samples relapsed within five years. EFC#93-positive disseminated disease in post-chemotherapy samples seems to respond to anti-hormonal treatment. The presence of EFC#93 serum DNAme identified 42.9% and 25% of women who were diagnosed with a fatal BC within 3-6 and 6-12 months of sample donation, respectively, with a specificity of 88%. The sensitivity with respect to detecting fatal BC was ~ 4-fold higher compared to non-fatal BC. Conclusions: Detection of EFC#93 serum DNAme patterns offers a new tool for early diagnosis and management of disseminated breast cancers. Clinical trials are required to assess whether EFC#93-positive women in the absence of radiological detectable breast cancers will benefit from anti-hormonal treatment before the breast lesions become clinically apparent. © 2017 The Author(s).","Breast cancer; Cell-free DNA; DNA methylation; Early diagnosis; Personalized treatment; Serum DNA",Article,Scopus

A number of theories of behaviour change suggest that before people will change health behaviours, they must accept that a risk applies to them. This study aimed to explore the views of the public on receiving personalised cancer risk information and the potential for that information to motivate behaviour change. Methods: We conducted 27 interviews with members of the public (mean age 49 ± 23 years). Each participant completed a questionnaire to allow calculation of their risk of developing the most common cancers (10 for women, 8 for men). During the interviews we presented their risk using a web-based tool developed for the study and discussions covered their views on receiving that information. Each interview was audio-recorded and then analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Participants generally viewed the concept of personalised cancer risk positively. The first reaction of almost all when presented with their 10-year risk of an individual cancer without any further context was that it was low and not concerning. Views on what constituted a high risk ranged widely, from 0.5 to 60%. All felt seeing the impact of changes in lifestyle was helpful. For some this led to intentions to change behaviour, but reductions in risk were not always motivating as the risks were considered low and differences small. Conclusions: Provision of personalised cancer risk was well received and may be a useful addition to other cancer prevention initiatives. Further work is needed in particular to develop ways to present cancer risk that reflect the general perception of what constitutes a risk high enough to motivate behaviour change and help patients contextualise a less well known health risk by providing a frame of reference. © 2018 The Author(s).","Cancer; Communication; Prevention; Qualitative research; Risk",Article,Scopus

The early and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer has great importance in the treatment of the disease. In the diagnosis of breast cancer, histopathological analysis of cell and tissue specimens taken by biopsy is considered as the gold standard. Histopathological analysis is a tedious process that is highly dependent on the knowledge and experience of the pathologists. In this study; it is aimed to develop a computer-Aided system that can reduce the workload of pathologists and help them in their diagnosis. An image set containing benign and malignant tumor images of breast cancer has been studied. To perform texture analysis on tumor images; first order statistics, Gabor and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) feature extraction methods have been applied.

Consistent with immunosurveillance theory, the immune system is crucial to protect the host from developing tumors, and the major players in tumoral immunity are effector T cells. Anyway, cancer cells develop strategies of immunoevasion influencing the cancer-specific lymphocyte priming, activation, and effector function. Therefore, the T cell subsets that mature during the stages of tumor growth, differently contribute to disease progression and/or regression. In our study, we analyzed the intra-tumoral and peripheral T cell subsets' distribution in 30 patients with CRC, in order to clarify their functional role toward cancer. We found that percentage of infiltrating effector T cells decreased in cancer tissue than in healthy mucosa and that the tumor microenvironment negatively influences the cytolytic activity of T lymphocytes reactive to cancer cells. Moreover, we found that the tumor tissue was infiltrated by a large amount of ""not effector"" T (neT) cells with a regulatory or an anergic profile, which are unable to kill cancer cells, may be contributing to the CRC promotion. The presence of neT cells was investigated also in the peripheral blood of CRC patients, demonstrating that the peripheral T regulatory cells can inhibit the proliferation of effector T cells, confirming their immunosuppressive properties. Finally, monitoring the changes in circulating neT cells' frequencies after the tumor removal, we confirmed the role of cancer in the modulation of immune system, in particular, in supporting a Tregs-mediated immunosuppression. © 2017 Niccolai, Ricci, Russo, Nannini, Emmi, Taddei, Ringressi, Melli, Miloeva, Cianchi, Bechi, Prisco and Amedei.","Antitumor immune responses; Colorectal cancer; Not effector T cells; Regulatory T cells; T helper; Tumor microenvironment; Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes",Article,Scopus

Isoflurane is one of the volatile anesthetics used extensively for inhalational anesthesia and gynecological surgery. However, the effects of isoflurane on ovarian cancer have not been fully elucidated. It is widely studied that one of the biochemical fingerprints of cancer cells is the altered energy metabolism which is characterized by preferential dependence on glycolysis for energy production in an oxygen-independent manner. In the present study, we explored the roles of isoflurane in the regulation of cellular metabolism of ovarian cancer cells. We observed the glucose uptake, lactate production and extracellular acidification of two ovarian cancer cell lines, SKOV3 and TOV21G were significantly stimulated by isoflurane treatments at 1 and 2 h. The glycolysis enzymes, HK2, PKM2, and LDHA were up-regulated by isoflurane. We report that miR-21 was induced by isoflurane treatments in ovarian cancer cells, leading to the elevated AKT phosphorylation and up-regulation of glycolysis enzymes. In contrast, the mitochondrial functions were suppressed by isoflurane treatments: the oxygen consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and activities of complex I, II, and IV on the electron transport chain were significantly decreased under isoflurane treatments. Importantly, ovarian cancer cells become hypersensitive to glycolysis inhibitors with isoflurane pretreatments. The present study demonstrates that isoflurane treatments drive a metabolic switch of ovarian cancer cells and contributes to the discovery and development of clinical therapeutic agents against ovarian cancer. © 2017 The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Acovenoside A, isolated from the pericarps of Acokanthera oppositifolia, potently inhibited proliferation and induced cytotoxicity in A549 non-small-cell lung cancer cells with an IC 50 of 68 ± 3 nM after 48 h of exposure. Compared to the antineoplastic agent doxorubicin, acovenoside A was more potent in inhibiting the viability of A549 cancer cells. Moreover, acovenoside A exhibited selectivity against cancer cells, being significantly less toxic to lung fibroblasts and nontoxic for peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Analysis of the cell cycle profile in acovenoside A-treated A549 cells revealed mitotic arrest, due to accumulation of the G 2 /M regulators cyclin B 1 and CDK1, and cytokinesis failure.

Then, the mRNA expression of several markers related to different CD4+ T cell subsets including regulatory T cells (Treg), T helper (Th) type 1, 2 and 17 were determined. In addition, we investigated the expression of two inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) and inflammatory mediators including FASL, IDO, SOCS1, VEGF, and CCR7. Results: The results showed that the expression of Th1 and Th17 genes was decreased in tumor tissues compared to control tissues. In addition, we found that the gene expression related to these two cell subsets decreased during cancer progression. Moreover, the expression level of TNF-α increased with tumor progression.

Advanced design of nanomedicine including active targeting nanomedicine, tumor-responsive nanomedicine, and optimization of physicochemical properties to enable highly effective delivery of nanomedicine to tumors has further improved their therapeutic benefits. However, these strategies still could not conquer the delivery barriers of a tumor microenvironment such as heterogeneous blood flow, dense extracellular matrix, abundant stroma cells, and high interstitial fluid pressure, which severely impaired vascular transport of nanomedicines, hindered their effective extravasation, and impeded their interstitial transport to realize uniform distribution inside tumors. Therefore, modulation of tumor microenvironment has now emerged as an important strategy to improve nanomedicine delivery to tumors. Here, we review the existing strategies and approaches for tumor microenvironment modulation to improve tumor perfusion for helping more nanomedicines to reach the tumor site, to facilitate nanomedicine extravasation for enhancing transvascular transport, and to improve interstitial transport for optimizing the distribution of nanomedicines. These strategies may provide an avenue for the development of new combination chemotherapeutic regimens and reassessment of previously suboptimal agents. © 2017 Zhang, Hu and Pang.","Extracellular matrix; Interstitial fluid pressure; Nanomedicine; Tumor microenvironment; Tumor nanomedicine delivery; Tumor perfusion",Review,Scopus

We investigated use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and statins and risk of postoperative red blood cell transfusion in breast cancer patients. Methods: Using Danish population-based registries, we identified a cohort of women who underwent surgery for primary breast cancer (n=22,238) during 2005-2012 and ascertained their use of aspirin, NSAIDs, SSRIs, and statins. For each drug, patients were categorized as users if they filled ≥1 prescription in the 60 days prior to surgery. We calculated the 14-day risk of red blood cell transfusion and relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), comparing users with nonusers for each drug and adjusting for age, cancer stage, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score. Results: In our cohort, 1385 (6.2%) women were aspirin users, 1794 (8.0%) were NSAID users, 1110 (4.9%) were SSRI users, and 2053 (9.1%) were statin users. The overall risk of red blood cell transfusion was 1.3%. The 14-day risk of RBC transfusion was 3.5% among aspirin users versus 1.1% among aspirin nonusers (adjusted RR=1.9, 95% CI: 1.4-2.7), and 1.8% among SSRI users versus 1.2% among SSRI nonusers (adjusted RR=1.2, 95% CI: 0.7-1.9). Red blood cell transfusion risk was increased among NSAID users, but not in a sensitivity analysis with a 30-day exposure window. Red blood cell transfusion risk was not increased among SSRI and statin users. Conclusions: Primary breast cancer surgery confers a low risk of RBC transfusion. Still, use of aspirin and possibly NSAIDs, but not SSRIs and statins, is associated with increased red blood cell transfusion.

In our experiments, SH003 significantly decreased cell growth and colony formation in MCF-7/PAC cells and parental MCF-7 cells.

However, the biologic mechanisms have not been fully explored. In this study, BD exhibited more potent cytotoxic effect on pancreatic cancer (PanCa) cell lines, while exerted weaker cytotoxic effects on GES-1 cells (non-tumorigenic). BD was shown to elicit apoptosis through inducing both the intrinsic and extrinsic mitochondria-mediated caspase activations. Furthermore, the BD-induced apoptotic effects were dependent on the accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inactivation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Pretreatment with tempol completely prevented the cellular apoptosis induced by BD, and recovered the inactivation of AKT, which suggested ROS essentially involved in BD-elicited apoptosis and down-regulation of PI3K/Akt pathway. In addition, the results obtained from orthotopic xenograft in nude mice were congruent with those of the in vitro investigations.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the toxicity profile of dual chemotherapy and highly conformal external beam radiotherapy with image guided adaptive brachytherapy. Methods: Seventeen patients with cervical carcinoma FIGO stage IB2-IIIB were treated with curative intent between 2011 and 2015. A total dose of 50.4 Gy was prescribed to the elective pelvic nodal volume. Patients with 18FDG-PET/CT positive lymph nodes (n=15; 83.3%) received an additional boost to a total dose of 62 Gy. Chemotherapy prescription goals were: concomitant during 5 weeks of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) 40 mg/m2 cisplatin and 125 mg/m2 gemcitabine, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy from week 10 (2 cycles 50 mg/m2 cisplatin and 1000 mg/m2 gemcitabine). EBRT was followed by 3-4 fractions (6 Gy per fraction) of intrauterine image guided adaptive brachytherapy. Toxicities were graded according to the common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE v 4.0). Results: One (6%) patient developed acute grade 3 diarrhea. We did not record any other acute or late gastrointestinal or urogenital toxicity higher that grade 3. Most common acute hematological toxicity was anemia grade 2 recorded in 10 (59%) patients. There was only one case of grade 3 neutropenia (6%). The number of patients that received the complete chemotherapy regimen was gradually declining during the course of therapy. From week 2 to 5, gemcitabine was omitted in 4 (24%),7 (41%), 8 (47%), and 12 (71%) patients respectively, similarly, cisplatin was omitted in 2 (12%),3 (18%),1 (6%) and 7 (41%) patients respectively. Adjuvant chemotherapy was omitted in 8 patients (47%). During a median follow-up time of 20 months (5 to 63 months) 6 (35%) patients developed disease relapse with 5 (29%) of them in the form of systemic disease. Conclusions: In contrast to previous findings cisplatin and gemcitabine in combination with highly conformal radiation therapy seems to have an acceptable toxicity profile.

Aberrant methylation patterns of linked CpGs analyzed in DNA fragments shed by cancers into the bloodstream (i.e. cell-free DNA) can provide highly specific signals indicating cancer presence. Methods: We analyzed 699 cancerous and non-cancerous tissues using a methylation array or reduced representation bisulfite sequencing to discover the most specific OC methylation patterns. A three-DNA-methylation-serum-marker panel was developed using targeted ultra-high coverage bisulfite sequencing in 151 women and validated in 250 women with various conditions, particularly in those associated with high CA125 levels (endometriosis and other benign pelvic masses), serial samples from 25 patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and a nested case control study of 172 UKCTOCS control arm participants which included serum samples up to two years before OC diagnosis. Results: The cell-free DNA amount and average fragment size in the serum samples was up to ten times higher than average published values (based on samples that were immediately processed) due to leakage of DNA from white blood cells owing to delayed time to serum separation. Despite this, the marker panel discriminated high grade serous OC patients from healthy women or patients with a benign pelvic mass with specificity/sensitivity of 90.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 84.3-94.8%) and 41.4% (95% CI = 24.1-60.9%), respectively. Levels of all three markers plummeted after exposure to chemotherapy and correctly identified 78% and 86% responders and non-responders (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.04), respectively, which was superior to a CA125 cut-off of 35 IU/mL (20% and 75%). 57.9% (95% CI 34.0-78.9%) of women who developed OC within two years of sample collection were identified with a specificity of 88.1% (95% CI = 77.3-94.3%). Sensitivity and specificity improved further when specifically analyzing CA125 negative samples only (63.6% and 87.5%, respectively). Conclusions: Our data suggest that DNA methylation patterns in cell-free DNA have the potential to detect a proportion of OCs up to two years in advance of diagnosis and may potentially guide personalized treatment. The prospective use of novel collection vials, which stabilize blood cells and reduce background DNA contamination in serum/plasma samples, will facilitate clinical implementation of liquid biopsy analyses. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cell-free DNA; DNA methylation; Early diagnosis; Ovarian cancer; Personalized treatment; Screening; Serum DNA",Article,Scopus

Autophagy is an important cellular mechanism underlying chemoresistance. Recent research advances have given new insights into the use of natural bioactive compounds to overcome chemoresistance in colon cancer chemotherapy. As one of the multitargeted and safer phytomedicines, curcumin has been reported to work as cancer-specific chemosensitizer, presumably via induction of autophagic signaling pathways. The precise therapeutic effect of curcumin on autophagy in determining tumorous cells' fate, however, remains unclear. This study was conducted to investigate the differential modulations of the treatments either with 5-Fu alone or 5-Fu combined with curcumin on cellular autophagic responses and viabilities in the human colon cancer cells HCT116 and HT29, and explore molecular signaling transductions underlying the curcumin-mediated autophagic changes and potentiation of 5-Fu's cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Methods: Cell proliferation assay and morphology observation were used to identify the cytotoxicity of different combinations of curcumin and 5-Fu in HCT116 and HT29 cells. Cell immunofluorescence assay, Flow cytometry and Western blot were employed to detect changes of autophagy and the autophagy-related signaling pathways in the colon cancer cells and/or xenograft mice. Results: Curcumin could significantly augment the cytotoxicity of 5-Fu to the tumorous cells, and the pre-treatment with curcumin followed by 5-Fu (pre-Cur) proved to be the most effective one compared to other two combinations. The chemosensitizing role of curcumin might attribute to the autophagy turnover from being activated in 5-Fu mono-treatment to being inhibited in the pre-Cur treatment as indicated by the changes in expression of beclin-1, p62 and LC3II/LC3I and the intensity of Cyto-ID Green staining. The autophagic alterations appeared to be contributed by down-regulation of not only the phospho-Akt and phospho-mTOR expressions but the phospho-AMPK and phospho-ULK1 levels as well. The cellular activation of AMPK by addition of A-769662 to the pre-Cur combination resulted in reversed changes in expressions of the autophagy protein markers and apoptotic status compared to those of the pre-Cur combination treatment. The findings were validated in the xenograft mice, in which the tumor growth was significantly suppressed in the mice with 25-day combination treatment, and meanwhile expressions of the autophagy markers, P-AMPK and P-ULK1 were all reversely altered in line with those observed in HCT116 cells. Conclusion: Pre-treatment with curcumin followed by 5-Fu may mediate autophagy turnover both in vitro and in vivo via AMPK/ULK1-dependent autophagy inhibition and AKT modulation, which may account for the increased susceptibility of the colon cancer cells/xenograft to the cytotoxicity of 5-Fu. © 2017 The Author(s).","5-fluorouracil; Autophagy; Colon cancer; Combination chemotherapy; Curcumin",Article,Scopus

To evaluate its success and its potential impact on cervical cancer screening, HPV genotypes were examined in 18-year-old girls five years later (sub-study 1) and in outpatients participating to cervical cancer screening before and after vaccine implementation (sub-study 2). Methods: For sub-study 1, 3726 females aged 18 in 2013 were invited to fill a questionnaire on personal demographics and HPV risk factors and to provide a self-collected cervicovaginal sample for HPV genotyping and Chlamydia trachomatis PCR. Personal data were evaluated by univariable and multivariable statistics. In sub-study 2, the proportion of the vaccine-type HPV among anogenital HPV was examined with archived genotyping data of 8039 outpatients participating to cervical cancer screening from 1999 till 2015. The yearly evolution of this proportion was evaluated by segmented logistic regression. Results: 690 (18.5%) women participated to sub-study 1 and 327 (8.8%) provided a self-collected sample. Prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis (4.6%) and demographics confirmed that the subjects were representative of sexually-active Swiss young women. Vaccine (five-year coverage: 77.5%) was preferentially accepted by contraceptive-pill users (P = 0.001) and samples were mainly provided by sexually-active subjects (P < 0.001). The proportion (4%) of the vaccine-type HPV in this population was lower than in sub-study 2 outpatients (n = 849, <26 years old) in the pre-vaccine era (25.7%). The proportion of the high-risk vaccine-type HPV decreased significantly (59%, P = 0.0048) in the outpatients during the post-vaccine era, yet this decrease was restricted to those aged less than 26 years (n = 673, P < 0.0001). Conclusions: The low proportion of vaccine-type HPV in 18-year-old females and its rapid decrease in young women participating to cervical cancer screening extend the success of HPV vaccination to Switzerland. Our data suggest that cervical cancer screening is now entering a stage of reduced proportion of HPV16 and/or 18 in samples reported positive by cytology. In view of the high likelihood of reduced clinical specificity of cytology, primary screening modalities involving HPV testing and cytology should now be re-evaluated in Switzerland. © 2017 The Author(s).","Anyplex II™ HPV28; Cervical cancer screening; Chlamydia trachomatis; Gardasil®; HPV genotyping; HPV vaccine; Human papillomavirus; PGMY-CHUV; Real-time PCR; Segmented logistic regression",Article,Scopus

Telomere maintenance is required for achieving immortality by neoplastic cells. While most cancer cells rely on telomerase re-activation for linear chromosome maintenance and sustained proliferation, a significant population of cancers (10-15%) employs telomerase-independent strategies, collectively referred to as Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT). ALT mechanisms involve different types of homology-directed telomere recombination and synthesis. These processes are facilitated by loss of the ATRX or DAXX chromatin-remodeling factors and by abnormalities of the telomere nucleoprotein architecture. Although the functional consequences of telomerase and ALT up-regulation are similar in that they both prevent overall telomere shortening in tumors, these telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMMs) differ in several aspects which may account for their differential prognostic significance and response to therapy in various tumor types. Therefore, reliable methods for detecting telomerase activity and ALT are likely to become an important pre-requisite for the use of treatments targeting one or other of these mechanisms. However, the question whether ALT presence can confer sensitivity to rationally designed anti-cancer therapies is still open. Here we review the latest discoveries in terms of mechanisms of ALT activation and maintenance in human tumors, methods for ALT identification in cell lines and human tissues and biomarkers validation. Then, original results on sensitivity to rational based pre-clinical and clinical anti-tumor drugs in ALT vs hTERT positive cells will be presented. © 2017 The Author(s).","Alt; Cancer therapy; G-quadruplex ligands; Telomeres",Review,Scopus

Upon exposure to ultrasound, in situ conversion of PGL-DiR MBs into nanoparticles resulted in a remarkable increase in fluorescence intensity (~5 folds) in tumor compared with PGL-DiR NPs, validating the enhanced tumor accumulation and cellular uptake of therapeutic agents. PGL-DiR MBs showed complete tumor ablation without recurrence in vivo, while PGL-DiR NPs showed only 72.6% tumor growth inhibition at the same dose. We believe that PGL-DiR MBs will soon reach their full potential as an important class of phototherapeutic formulations and will contribute to remarkable advances in cancer treatments. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

There are several technologies in clinical use to perform breast IORT. Regardless of technique, IORT generally refers to the delivery of a single dose of radiation to the periphery of the tumor bed in the immediate intraoperative time frame, although some protocols have performed IORT as a second procedure. There are two large prospective randomized trials establishing the safety and efficacy of breast IORT in early stage breast cancer patients with sufficient follow-up time on thousands of women. The advantages of IORT for partial breast irradiation include: direct visualization of the target tissue ensuring treatment of the high-risk tissue and eliminating the risk of marginal miss; the use of a single dose coordinated with the necessary surgical excision thereby reducing omission of radiation and the selection of mastectomy for women without access to a radiotherapy facility or unable to undergo several weeks of daily radiation; favorable toxicity profiles; patient convenience and cost savings; radiobiological and tumor microenvironment conditions which lead to enhanced tumor control. The main disadvantage of IORT is the lack of final pathologic information on the tumor size, histology, margins, and nodal status. When unexpected findings on final pathology such as positive margins or positive sentinel nodes predict a higher risk of local or regional recurrence, additional whole breast radiation may be indicated, thereby reducing some of the convenience and low-toxicity advantages of sole IORT. However, IORT as a tumor bed boost has also been studied and appears to be safe with acceptable toxicity. IORT has potential efficacy advantages related to overall survival related to reduced cardiopulmonary radiation doses. It may also be very useful in specific situations, such as prior to oncoplastic reconstruction to improve accuracy of adjuvant radiation delivery, or when used as a boost in higher risk patients to improve tumor control. Ongoing international clinical trials are studying these uses and follow-up data are accumulating on completed studies. © 2017 Harris and Small.","Breast cancer; Breast conservation therapy; Intraoperative radiotherapy; Partial breast irradiation; Radiation therapy",Review,Scopus

Methods: We identified several potential microRNAs targeting EphA2 by bioinformatics websites and then analyzed the role of miR-302b in modulating EphA2 in vitro and in vivo of GC, and it's mechanism. Results: Our analysis identified miR-302b, a novel regulator of EphA2, as one of the most significantly downregulated microRNA (miRNA) in GC tissues. Overexpression of miR-302b impaired GC cell migratory and invasive properties robustly and suppressed cell proliferation by arresting cells at G0-G1 phase in vitro. miR-302b exhibited anti-tumor activity by reversing EphA2 regulation, which relayed a signaling transduction cascade that attenuated the functions of N-cadherin, β-catenin, and Snail (markers of Wnt/β-catenin and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, EMT). This modulation of EphA2 also had distinct effects on cell proliferation and migration in GC in vivo.

Methods: This 3-part sequential study evaluated nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m 2 plus gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks. Part 1 evaluated safety. Part 2 evaluated efficacy using Simon's optimal 2-stage design: if &gt;2 responses were observed in Stage 1 (n = 28), 54 additional patients would be enrolled in Stage 2. If &gt;9 responses were observed, the study was complete. Otherwise, nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine would be compared with gemcitabine alone in Part 3. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS), and safety. Results: Eighty-three patients were treated. The prespecified primary endpoint was met: the independently assessed ORR in Stages 1 + 2 was 35% (95% CI, 24.8-46.2); therefore, Part 3 was not initiated. The median DOR was 8.9 months (95% CI, 6.01-8.94). The median OS and progression-free survival were 9.2 (95% CI, 7.6-11.1) and 5.5 (95% CI, 5.29-7.16) months, respectively. The 12-month OS rate was 30%. In an updated analysis, the median OS was 9.3 months and the 12-month OS rate was 32%. Longer OS was observed in patients with baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ≤ 5 vs &gt; 5. The most common grade ≥ 3 adverse events were leukopenia (35%), neutropenia (34%), anemia (15%), thrombocytopenia (10%), and fatigue (13%). Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 7% of patients (no grade 4 reported). Conclusions: The MPACT regimen of nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine is efficacious in Chinese patients with MPC.

Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is a class of noncoding RNAs with crucial roles in many cancers. However, the roles of lncRNAs in melanoma have not been well studied. In the present study, using public available data and clinical tissues samples, we found that lncRNA ILF3-AS1 is up-regulated in melanoma tissues and cell lines, and correlated with poor prognosis of melanoma patients. Functional experiments showed that knockdown of ILF3-AS1 inhibits melanoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Mechanistically, we found that ILF3-AS1 interacts with EZH2, promotes the binding of EZH2 to the miR-200b/a/429 promoter, and represses miR-200b/a/429 expression. The expression of ILF3-AS1 is negatively correlated with that of miR-200b/a/429 in melanoma tissues. Moreover, inhibition of miR-200b/a/429 abrogates the biological roles of ILF3-AS1 knockdown on melanoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that melanoma-upregulated lncRNA ILF3-AS1 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via negatively regulating miR-200b/a/429, and imply that ILF3-AS1 may be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for melanoma.",,Article,Scopus

Eligible studies published till May 1, 2017 were searched from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CNKI database about such association. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate such association. And the Begg's funnel plot and Egger's test were applied to assess the publication bias. This meta-analysis contained 37049 cases and 52444 controls from 87 publications with 91 eligible case-control studies.

Originally, there was no association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and CRC susceptibility (OR =0.99, 95% CI =0.94-1.05). After excluding 13 studies according to their heterogeneity and publication bias, rs1801133 polymorphism was found to reduce the risks of CRC significantly (OR =0.96, 95% CI =0.94-0.99). In the subgroup analysis of ethnicity, there was a significant association in Asians (OR =0.94, 95% CI =0.89-1.00).

Agonistic activation of NKT cells leads to rapid pro-inflammatory and immune modulatory cytokine and chemokine responses. This property of NKT cells, in conjunction with their interactions with antigen-presenting cells, controls downstream innate and adaptive immune responses against cancers and infectious diseases, as well as in several inflammatory disorders. NKT cell properties are acquired during development in the thymus and by interactions with the host microbial consortium in the gut, the nature of which can be influenced by NKT cells. This latter property, together with the role of the host microbiota in cancer therapy, necessitates a new perspective.

Recent studies have reported that although inhibition of PP2A leads to acceleration of cell growth, it also induces damaged cells to pass through the cell cycle and renders them sensitive to radiotherapy. Here, we investigated the radiosensitizing effects of digoxin as a PP2A inhibitor in two non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell types (H460 and A549) with differential sensitivity to radiation. Digoxin inhibited the proliferation of H460 and A549 cells in a dose-dependent fashion and was especially effective on radioresistant A549 cells. Interestingly, the radiosensitizing effect of digoxin was only present in the radioresistant A549 cells and xenografts. The combination of digoxin and ionizing radiation (IR) significantly reduced clonogenic survival and xenograft tumor growth (P<0.001), compared with IR alone. Digoxin suppressed PP2A protein expression and prevented IR-induced PP2A expression in A549 cells. Digoxin treatment combined with IR allowed the damaged cell to progress through the cell cycle via suppression of cell cycle-related proteins (p53, cyclin D1, cyclin B1, CDK4, and p-cdc2). Moreover, digoxin enhanced IR-induced DNA damage through reduction in levels of repair proteins and elevation of p-ATM foci formation up to 24 h (P<0.001). In conclusion, digoxin has a novel function as a PP2A inhibitor, and combined with IR produces a synergistic effect on radiosensitizing cells, thereby indicating a potentially promising therapeutic approach to radioresistant lung cancer treatment. © 2017 The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Luciferase reporter assay was used to evaluate the Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity. For assessing the effects of Wnt5a on tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, A549 cells transfected with sh-Wnt5a were subcutaneously or orthotopically injected into nude mice. In NSCLC tissues, higher expression levels of Wnt5a and ROR2 were found, β-Catenin was expressed exceptionally, and EMT was prompted. Wnt5a overexpression increased clone formation, migration, and invasion, as well as prompted EMT of NSCLC cell in vitro, whereas Wnt5a knockdown showed the absolutely reversed results. Wnt5a overexpression enhanced the Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity and elevated the nuclear β-catenin level in NSCLC cells, without altering the ROR2 expression.

Only a few cases deriving from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma have been reported in the literature to date. Case presentation: We report a case of a 47-year-old Caucasian woman who presented to our hospital with a solitary breast lesion in the right upper external quadrant associated with multiple bone and visceral metastases. Two years before, she had undergone radical resection of a squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (stage pT2, pN1), which was followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Breast ultrasound showed a hypoechogenic tumor lesion of 4 cm in the right upper external quadrant that was associated with multiple axillary and infra-/supraclavicular adenopathies. A positron emission tomographic scan documented multiple visceral and bone metastases with a single hypermetabolic lesion of the right breast. The results of histology and immunohistochemistry were consistent with a metastasis from a squamous cell carcinoma. The patient died of acute respiratory insufficiency 1 month after her breast metastasis diagnosis and before starting any systemic antitumoral treatment. Conclusions: Although breast metastases are extremely rare, they should be considered in any patient with a history of cancer and confirmed by histology and immunohistochemistry because they are very difficult to distinguish from other primary breast tumors based only on clinical and radiological features. There are no standardized treatment guidelines for breast metastasis management. Surgery and radiotherapy can play a role in symptom palliation, but they do not have any relevant impact on survival, the prognosis being poor, with an estimated overall survival less than 1 year from diagnosis. © 2017 The Author(s).","Breast; Head and neck; Metastasis; Oropharynx",Article,Scopus

Although CAR T cell therapy has made remarkable strides in the treatment of patients with certain hematological cancers, in solid tumors success has been limited likely due to heterogeneous antigen expression, immunosuppressive networks in the tumor microenvironment limiting CAR T cell function and persistence, and suboptimal trafficking to solid tumors. Here, we outline specific approaches to overcome barriers to CAR T cell effectiveness in the context of the tumor microenvironment and offer our perspective on how expanding the use of CAR T cells in solid tumors may require modifications in CAR T cell design.

Surprisingly, there is a relative lack of research and report on the topic of supervision, even though it is regularly used in medical training. Building on our research and teaching experience on BBN at the undergraduate level, as well as interviews of supervisors, the following key elements have been identified: learning objectives (e.g., raising student awareness of structural elements of the interview, emotion (patients and students) handling), pedagogical approach (being centered on student’s needs and supportive to promote already existing competences), essentials (e.g., discussing skills and examples from the clinical practice), and enhancing reflexivity while discussing specific issues (e.g., confusion between the needs of the patient and those of the student). Individual supervision has been identified as crucial and most satisfactory by students to provide guidance and to foster a reflexive stance enabling them to critically apprehend their communication style. Ultimately, the challenge is to teach medical students to not only connect with the patient but also with themselves. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Education","Breaking bad news; Cancer; Communication; Communication skills training; Oncology; Supervision; Undergraduate medical education",Article in Press,Scopus

Dietary FA intake has been reported to be associated with a lower risk of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). However, the molecular mechanisms of FA in NPC cells remain unclear. In the present study, we found that FA treatment dose dependently inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of NPC cells, via folate receptor α (FRα). We further found that FA, bound to FRα, induced the activation of MEK/ERK1/2, and increased the expressions of TSLC1 and E-cadherin. Moreover, blocking of ERK1/2 activation attenuated FA-mediated increase in TSLC1 expression. In addition, knockdown of TSLC1 abolished the FA-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and suppressed the FA-mediated increase oinE-cadherin expression in NPC cells. Taken together, our data suggest that FA treatment inhibits NPC cell proliferation and invasion via activation of FRα/ERK1/2/ TSLC1 signaling pathway.

This investigation aims to evaluate the possibility of using simple devices, e.g. a cotton swab and a glass slide, for self-sampling in order to detect human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA by PCR in cervico-vaginal cells. Methods: In the first phase of our study we evaluated the use of a glass slide as a transport medium for cervical cells. A physician took paired-cervical samples from 235 women. One sample was transported in Easyfix® solution and the other sample was smeared over a glass slide. Both were further analyzed and compared for human DNA recovery and HPV detection. A kappa value was determined to evaluate the agreement between the HPV DNA detection rates. In the second phase of the study, 222 women from the urban, peri-urban and rural regions of Cochabamba were requested to perform self-sampling using the following devices: a cotton swab combined with a glass slide, and a vaginal tampon. Women gave their opinion about the self-sampling technique. Finally, the agreement for high risk-HPV detection between self- and physician-collected samples was performed in 201 samples in order to evaluate the self-sampling technique. Results: Firstly, the comparison between Easyfix® solution and the glass slide to transport clinical samples gave a good agreement for HPV DNA detection (Κ = 0.71, 95% CI 0.60-0.81). Secondly, self-sampling, especially with cotton swab combined with glass slide, would generally be preferred over clinician sampling for a screening program based on HPV detection. Finally, we showed a good agreement between self- and physician collected samples for high risk-HPV detection (Κ = 0.71, 95% CI 0.55-0.88). Conclusions: Simple devices such as a cotton swab and a glass slide can be used to perform self-sampling and HPV DNA detection. Furthermore, most Bolivian women preferred self-sampling over clinician-sampling for cervical cancer screening. © 2017 The Author(s).","Acceptability; Devices; HPV screening; Human papillomavirus; Self-sampling",Article,Scopus

Despite STID-associated complications and poorer quality of life (QoL), no validated assessment tools exist to accurately assess STID occurrence and severity to guide clinical management. Therefore, we developed and validated a patient-reported questionnaire (STIDAT). Methods: The STIDAT was developed using the FDA iterative process for patient-reported outcomes. A literature search uncovered potential items and questions for questionnaire construction used by oncology clinicians to develop questions for the preliminary instrument. The instrument was evaluated on its face validity and content validity by patient interviews. Repetitive, similar and different themes uncovered from patient interviews were implemented to revise the instrument to the version used for validation. Patients starting high-risk STID treatments were monitored using the STIDAT, bowel diaries and EORTC QLQ-C30. The STIDAT was evaluated for construct validity using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using minimal residual method with Promax rotation, reliability and consistency. A weighted scoring system was developed and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve evaluated the tool's ability to detect STID occurrence. Median scores and variability were analysed to determine how well it differentiates between diarrhea severities. A post-hoc analysis determined how diarrhea severity impacted QoL of cancer patients. Results: Patients defined diarrhea based on presence of watery stool. The STIDAT assessed patient's perception of having diarrhea, daily number of bowel movements, daily number of diarrhea episodes, antidiarrheal medication use, the presence of urgency, abdominal pain, abdominal spasms or fecal incontinence, patient's perception of diarrhea severity, and QoL. These dimensions were sorted into four clusters using EFA - patient's perception of diarrhea, frequency of diarrhea, fecal incontinence and abdominal symptoms. Cronbach's alpha was 0.78; kappa ranged from 0.934-0.952, except for abdominal spasms (Κ = 0.0455). The positive predictive value was 96.4%, with the minimum score of 1.35 predicting a positive STID occurrence. Patients with moderate or severe diarrhea experience significant decreases in QoL compared to those with no diarrhea. Conclusions: This is the first patient-reported questionnaire that accurately predicts the occurrence and severity of diarrhea in oncology patients via assessing several bowel habit dimensions. © 2017 The Author(s).","Assessment; Diarrhea; Patient-reported; Quality of life; Questionnaire; Supportive care; Validation",Article,Scopus

It has been reported that TET1 is a tumour suppressor in several cancers. However, whether TET1 plays a role in glioma development is largely unclear. Different glioma specimens and corresponding normal controls were collected to analyse the expression of TET1. At the same time, TET1 of glioma U251 cells was knocked down or overexpressed to observe its effect on glioma cell proliferation and invasion as well as autophagy level. Here, we reported that the expression of TET1 in glioma tissue was significantly lower than the corresponding non-tumour normal tissues, and the concentration of TET1 is negatively correlated with the glioma WHO classification. When TET1 gene in glioma U251 cells was knocked down by CRISPR/Caspase-9 system, the proliferation and invasive ability of U251 increased remarkably. But when TET1 was overexpressed in U251 cells, the proliferation and invasion were impaired. Following the down-expression of TET1, the level of autophagy in U251 cells decreased accordingly.However, when TET1 was overexpressed in U251 cells, the level of autophagy incraesed. Furthermore, bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1) but not 3-methyladenine (3-MA) could decrease the autophagy level of TET1-/- U251 cells as the wild-type controls.

Consequently, this results in genomic integration of the potentially therapeutic gene into chromosomes of the desired target cells, and thus conferring stable expression. Non-viral transfectionmethods are typically preferred to deliver the transposon components into the target cells. However, these methods do not match the efficacy typically attained with viral vectors and are sometimes associated with cellular toxicity evoked by the DNA itself. In recent years, the overall transposition efficacy has gradually increased by codon optimization of the transposase, generation of hyperactive transposases, and/or introduction of specific mutations in the transposon terminal repeats. Their versatility enabled the stable genetic engineering in many different primary cell types, including stem/progenitor cells and differentiated cell types. This prompted numerous preclinical proof-of-concept studies in disease models that demonstrated the potential of DNA transposons for ex vivo and in vivo gene therapy. One of the merits of transposon systems relates to their ability to deliver relatively large therapeutic transgenes that cannot readily be accommodated in viral vectors such as full-length dystrophin cDNA.

One aim of palliative care is to enable a home death if desired and well supported. However, there is little data to inform care, particularly from countries without paediatric palliative care, which constitute the majority worldwide. Methods: This is an epidemiological study analysing death certificate data of decedents aged between 0 and 17 years in Portugal, a developed Western European country without recognised provision of paediatric palliative care, from 1987 to 2011. We analysed death certificate data on cause and place of death; the main outcome measure was home death. Complex chronic conditions included cancer, cardiovascular, neuromuscular, congenital/genetic, respiratory, metabolic, gastro-intestinal, renal, and haematology/immunodeficiency conditions. Multivariate analysis determined factors associated with home death in these conditions. Results: Annual deaths decreased from 3268 to 572. Of 38,870 deaths, 10,571 were caused by complex chronic conditions, their overall proportion increasing from 23.7% to 33.4% (22.4% to 45.4% above age 1-year). For these children, median age of death increased from 0.5 to 4.32-years; 19.4% of deaths occurred at home, declining from 35.6% to 11.5%; factors associated with home death were year of death (adjusted odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.89-0.90), age of death (6-10 year-olds 21.46, 16.42-28.04, reference neonates), semester of death (October-March 1.18, 1.05-1.32, reference April-September), and cause of death (neuromuscular diseases 1.59, 1.37-1.84, reference cancer), with wide regional variation. Conclusions: This first trend analysis of paediatric deaths in Portugal (an European country without paediatric palliative care) shows that palliative care needs are increasing. Children are surviving longer and, in contrast with countries where paediatric palliative care is thriving, there is a long-term trend of dying in hospital instead of at home. Age, diagnosis, season and region are associated with home death, and should be considered when planning services to support families choosing this option. Priorities should address needs of the youngest children, those with cancer, neuromuscular and cardiovascular conditions, as well as inequities related to place of residence. © 2017 The Author(s).","Child; Epidemiology; Health services; Mortality; Palliative care",Article,Scopus

As part of our continuing search for bioactive secondary metabolites from Arctic marine invertebrates, the organic extract of Securiflustra securifrons was examined. This resulted in the isolation of three new halogenated, hexacyclic indole-imidazole alkaloids, securamines H-J (1-3), together with the previously reported compounds securamines C (4) and E (5). The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic methods including 1D and 2D NMR and analysis of HRMS data. Through NMR and HRMS analysis, we were also able to prove that 1, 2, 4, and 5, when dissolved in MeOH, were converted into their corresponding artifacts, the securamine MeOH adducts m1, m2, m4, and m5. When redissolved in a non-nucleophilic solvent, the native variants were re-formed. We also found that 3 was a MeOH addition product of a native variant. Even though the structures of several securamines have been reported, their bioactivities were not examined. The securamines displayed various degrees of cytotoxicity against the human cancer cell lines A2058 (skin), HT-29 (colon), and MCF-7 (breast), as well as against nonmalignant human MRC-5 lung fibroblasts.

Both gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (a-GnRH) and dienogest have been suggested as additional hormone therapy for patients with endometriomas. However, the result of hormonal suppression before an in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle remains undetermined. Materials and methods: A prospective cohort study of 144 infertile women planning IVF after laparoscopic surgery of ovarian endometriomas was conducted at our department in 2012–2015. Patients were divided into three groups: group I (N = 38) with dienogest course, group II (N = 70) with a-GnRH group III (N = 70) without any hormonal therapy within 6 months preceding IVF. Results: The study groups did not differ by removed endometriomas size and ovarian reserve indicators. The gonadotropin dose per Cycle was higher, while the number of retrieved oocytes was lower in group III patients (p <.001). In women with dienogest pretreatment, clinical pregnancy rate was 2.5 times (44.7% versus 16.7%, p =.012) and delivery rate–three times higher (36.8% versus 11.1%, p =.013) as compared with those from group III. Conclusions: The present study confirms the necessity of pre-cycle medical interventions in women with ovarian forms of endometriosis undergoing IVF. We suggest dienogest to be possibly more efficient treatment option for this kind of patients. © 2017 The Author(s).

The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Melanoma (FACT-M) is validated in patients with melanoma, which shares many similarities with MCC. This paper reports the psychometric properties of the FACT-M in the metastatic MCC population. Methods: Data were collected as part of a single-arm, open-label, multicenter trial involving patients with metastatic MCC who had failed at least one previous line of chemotherapy. FACT-M and EQ-5D were administered at baseline, Week 7, Week 13, and Week 25. An optional interview was administered at the same time points. MCC-specific FACT-M scores were derived following a combined quantitative and qualitative approach. Reliability and construct validity of original and additional MCC-specific FACT-M scores were assessed at baseline. Capacity to detect change in tumor size was assessed from baseline to Week 7. Minimally important differences (MIDs) were computed using distribution and anchor-based methods. Results: Baseline assessments were available in 70 patients (mean age: 70 years; 74.3% male); 19 patients were interviewed at baseline. Additional MCC-specific scores were as follows: Physical Function score (six items), Psychological Impact score (six items), and MCC summary score (12 items). FACT-M original and additional MCC-specific scores both demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties: high reliability (Cronbach's alpha: 0.81-0.96), good convergent validity (correlations above 0.4 observed for 88% of items of the Melanoma surgery scale, 75% of items of the Melanoma scale, and 100% of items of the other FACT-M domains). Some evidence of floor/ceiling effects and poor discriminant ability was found. Higher scores (better HRQoL) on all FACT-M domains were observed in patients with better functioning (assessed by ECOG performance score), supporting clinical validity. Despite the small sample for responsiveness analysis (n =37), the majority of FACT-M scores showed sensitivity to changes in tumor size at Week 7 with small to moderate effect sizes. MIDs were consistent with previously reported values in the literature for FACT-M domains. Conclusions: FACT-M is suitable to capture HRQoL in patients with metastatic MCC, thus making it a potential candidate for assessing HRQoL in MCC trials.

One issue is limited tissue penetration, and the other is the lack of high-performance PSs. Therefore, the newly emerging two-photon excited PDT (2PE-PDT) has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its advantages such as a higher spatial resolution and a greater penetration depth.

A new class of emerging pollutants of high concern is cytostatic drugs, which are designed to treat different types of cancers by attacking cells. Environmental concentrations of cytostatic drugs are known to be in the range of ng L−1, and for this reason, it is imperative to develop analytical methods of extraction and preconcentration to allow for subsequent instrumental analysis of these drugs. In this work, a rapid, simple and green method for the analysis of seven cytostatic drug compounds that are commonly used in anti-cancer therapies was developed using a novel extraction process based on a powerful miniaturized technique, fabric phase sorptive extraction (FPSE) coupled to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS). The major parameters that affect the extraction process were optimized. The new method shows good linearity, with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of less than 12%. Relative recoveries higher than 40% were obtained for the studied compounds, and the detection limit of the method was within the values at which these compounds are usually found in environmental water (0.20 ng L−1 to 80 ng L−1). The Limit of Quantification ranged from 0.68 to 267 ng L−1. Significant suppression of the signal due to the matrix effect, a common shortcoming attributed to interference from the extraction process as well as the use of ionization mode, was not observed. Subsequently, the method was applied to real wastewater samples from an effluent obtained from a hospital area and three wastewater treatment plants located in Gran Canaria Island, Spain. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cytostatic compounds; Drug residues; Emerging pollutants; Fabric phase sorptive extraction; Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography; Wastewater",Article,Scopus

The difficulty in diagnosing acromegaly progression in pregnancy is that there is also production of placental growth hormone observed, making it impossible to differentiate from neoplastic growth hormone production using conventional methods of investigation. This article is about a clinical case of acromegaly in a 22 years old woman who was operated on using transnasal transsphenoidal approach and received postoperative treatment with somatostatin analog–lanreotide acetate autogel–for six months. The woman became pregnant in the course of the treatment. During pregnancy, the GH and IGF-I levels in serum remained within normal limits. Lanreotide acetate therapy was discontinued. The woman successfully gave birth to a healthy baby. There was a remission of the disease after pregnancy. © 2017 The Author(s).

However, few studies have focussed on the exact effects of busulfan treatment on the epididymis currently. The present study assessed the effect of busulfan on epididymal morphology and the blood-epididymis barrier in mice.We treated mice with a single injection of busulfan and detected the effect at different time points. We showed that busulfan was toxic to the morphological structure and function of the epididymis. Furthermore, busulfan treatment down-regulated the epididymal expression of vimentin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, there was an increase in total androgen receptor (AR) levels, whereas the estrogen receptor-α (ER-α) levels were reduced, both in the caput and cauda regions after busulfan treatment, which may be secondary to the testicular damage.

EDCs are the causative agents of diseases including reproductive disorders and cancers. This highlights the urgency to develop fast and sensitive methods to detect EDCs, which are detrimental even at very low concentrations. In this work, we propose a label-free surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor method to detect specific EDCs (17 β-estradiol (E2), ethinyl-estradiol, 4-nonylphenol, tamoxifen) through their binding to estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). We show that the use of rationally designed ERα (as bio-recognition element) in combination with conformation-sensitive peptides (as amplification agent, resulting in increased responses) enables the detection of low parts per billion (ppb) levels of E2. As a proof of concept, this bioassay was used to detect E2 in (spiked) real water samples from fish farms, rivers and the sea at low ppb levels after concentration by solid phase extraction. In addition, the present SPR assay that combines a conformation-sensitive peptide with an array of ERα mutants is very promising for the assessment of the risk of potential estrogenic activity for chemical substances. © 2018 by the authors.","17β-estradiol; Amplification; Estrogen receptor; Label-free assay; Surface plasmon resonance; Water",Article,Scopus

Family farming based on agroecology remains the main alternative to intensive pesticide-based models. However, even though 70% of farms are family managed, organic production is still scarcely found. Brazil is the world's largest consumer of pesticides and the incidence of diseases such as cancer, hypertension, diabetes and autoimmune diseases increase more and more. To complete this sad picture of public health, more than 56% of the population is overweight. This study aims to demonstrate how university extension activities in agroecology can assist the urban citizen to seek knowledge and alternatives in the acquisition and production of organic food. In March 2014, in partnership with various non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and with governmental support, was created the Center for Studies in Agroecology (NEA) based at the University of Passo Fundo (UPF). As a result, the theme agroecology and food security was present at the UPF through the elective subjects and courses of Agroecology and Medicinal Plants. There was a growing demand for lectures in several regional forums and it has established a great demand for distance learning course in agroecology. The main findings raised along with citizens were: a) increasing awareness of diseases originating from food and environmental contamination; b) growing disbelief in technical sales of products; c) increased demand for technicians who understand (and share) processes; d) increased demand for technical information of organic food production, aiming to achieve food self-sufficiency through urban gardens. It was concluded that educational activities in agroecology helped in the consolidation of identities and beliefs of farmers, citizens and university academics concerned with integrating environmental sustainability, traceability, public health and food security in a sustainable model for food production. In the heart of the matter, relearn, how to produce their own food has been the major premise, especially for conscious urban citizens. © 2017 ISHS.","Agroecology; Community gardens; Environmental education; Food self?sufficiency; Sustainability; Urban landscape",Conference Paper,Scopus

Its prognosis is poor, which is due to its genetic heterogeneity and our poor understanding of its underlying molecular mechanisms. The present study aimed to assess the relationship between plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), and their effects on the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells. The expression levels of PVT1 and EZH2 in human glioma tissues and cell lines were measured using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Then, after siRNA-PVT1 and entire PVT1 sequence vector transfection, we determined the regulation roles of PVT1 in the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of glioma cells. We found that the expression levels of both PVT1 and EZH2 were up-regulated in human glioma tissues and cell lines, and positively correlated with glioma malignancy. And, silencing of PVT1 expression resulted in decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, and decreased migration and invasion. In addition, exogenous PVT1 led to increased EZH2 expression and increased proliferation and induced proliferation and invasion. These data inferred that long non-coding RNA PVT1 could be served as an indicator of glioma prognosis, and PVT1-EZH2 regulatory pathway may be a novel therapeutic target for treating glioma. © 2017 The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Hcy is a sulfur containing amino acid derived from the essential amino acid methionine (Met). Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) was subsequently shown in several age-related pathologies such as osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Also, Hcy is associated with (but not limited to) cancer, aortic aneurysm, hypothyroidism and end renal stage disease to mention some. The circulating levels of Hcy can be increased by defects in enzymes of the metabolism of Met, deficiencies of vitamins B6, B12 and folate or by feeding Met enriched diets. Additionally, some of the pharmaceuticals currently in clinical practice such as lipid lowering, and anti-Parkinsonian drugs are known to elevate Hcy levels. Studies on supplementation with folate, vitamins B6 and B12 have shown reduction in Hcy levels but concomitant reduction in certain associated pathologies have not been definitive. The enormous importance of Hcy in health and disease is illustrated by its prevalence in the medical literature (e.g. &gt; 22,000 publications). Although there are compelling data in favor of Hcy as a modifiable risk factor, the debate regarding the significance of Hcy mediated health effects is still ongoing. Despite associations between increased levels of Hcy with several pathologies being well documented, whether it is a causative factor, or an effect remains inconclusive. The present review though not exhaustive, is focused on several important aspects of Hcy metabolism and their relevance to health. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cardiovascular disease; Dietary; Homocysteine; Hyperhomocysteinemia; Inflammation; Methionine",Review,Scopus

Here, we tested the hypothesis that in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ATP release, along with its well-known immune stimulatory effect, may also contribute to the generation of an immune suppressive microenvironment. In a cohort of AML patients, undergoing combined daunorubicin and cytarabine chemotherapy, a population of T regulatory cells (Tregs) with suppressive phenotype, expressing the immune checkpoint programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), was significantly increased. Moving from these results, initial in vitro data showed that daunorubicin was more effective than cytarabine in modulating DC function toward Tregs induction and such difference was correlated with the higher capacity of daunorubicin to induce ATP release from treated AML cells. DCs cultured with daunorubicin-treated AML cells upregulated indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), which induced anti-leukemia Tregs. These data were confirmed in vivo as daunorubicin-treated mice show an increase in extracellular ATP levels with increased number of Tregs, expressing PD-1 and IDO1+CD39+ DCs. Notably, daunorubicin failed to induce Tregs and tolerogenic DCs in mice lacking the ATP receptor P2X7.

Here, the anti-stress effect of ROEO on stress was evaluated in vivo and in vitro. Methods: Six-week-old male ICR mice were made to inhale ROEO and subjected to tail suspension test (TST). To determine the neuronal differentiation effect of ROEO in vitro, induction of ROEO-treated PC12 cells differentiation was observed. Intracellular acetylcholine and choline, as well as the Gap43 gene expression levels were also determined. Results: Inhalation of ROEO significantly decreased the immobility time of ICR mice and serum corticosterone level, accompanied by increased brain dopamine level. Determination of the underlying mechanism in vitro revealed a PC12 differentiation-induction effect through the modulation of intracellular acetylcholine, choline, and Gap43 gene expression levels. ROEO activates the stress response system through the NGF pathway and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, promoting dopamine production and secretion.

There is increasing focus on and demand for the evaluation of IHC practices. To ensure such evaluations capture their full scope, a clear understanding of the types of outcomes relevant to an IHC approach is needed. The objective was to describe the health domains and health outcomes relevant to IHC practices in Canada. Methods: An online survey of Canadian IHC clinics. Survey questions were informed by the IN-CAM Health Outcomes Database. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. Chi square tests were used to compare responses between clinic types and patient groups served. Results: Surveys were completed by 21 clinics (response rate: 50%). Physical, psychological, social, individualized and holistic were identified as applicable health domains by more than 90% of the clinics. Spiritual domain was the least relevant (70% of clinics). A number of relevant outcomes within each domain were identified. A core set of outcomes were identified and included: fatigue, anxiety, stress, and patient-provider relationship, and quality of life. Clinics with primarily conventional health practitioners were less likely to address overall well-being (p = 0.04), while clinics that provided care to a specialized patient population (i.e. cancer patients) or a mix of general and specialized patients were less likely to address religious practices (p = 0.04) or spiritual experiences (p = 0.007). Conclusions: Outcomes across health domains should be considered in the evaluation of IHC models to generate an understanding of the full scope of effectiveness of IHC approaches. The core set of outcomes identified may facilitate this task.

Humans can be infected by accidental ingestion of T. canis embryonated ovum-contaminated food, water, or encapsulated larvae in paratenic hosts' viscera or meat. Since humans and mice are paratenic hosts of T. canis, the wandering larvae might cause mechanical tissue damage and excretory-secretory antigens may trigger inflammatory injuries to local organs. Long-term residence of T. canis larvae in a paratenic host's brain may cause cerebral toxocariasis (CT) that contributes to cerebral damage, neuroinflammation and neuropsychiatric disorders in mice and clinical patients. Since the hippocampus has been long recognized as being responsible for learning and memory functions, parasitic invasion of this site may cause neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. The present study intended to assess pathological changes, expressions of neurodegeneration-associated factors (NDAFs), including transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, S100B, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), transglutaminase type 2 (TG2), claudin-5, substance P (SP) and interleukin (IL)-1β, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) function in the hippocampus and associated cognitive behavior in ICR mice orally inoculated with a high, medium or low-dose of T. canis embryonated ova during a 20-week investigation. Results: Results indicated although there were insignificant differences in learning and memory function between the experimental mice and uninfected control mice, possibly because the site where T. canis larvae invaded was the surrounding area but not the hippocampus per se. Nevertheless, enhanced expressions of NDAF, persistent UPS impairment and excess amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation concomitantly emerged in the experimental mice hippocampus at 8, 16 and 20 weeks post-infection. Conclusions: We thus postulate that progressive CT may still progress to neurodegeneration due to enhanced NDAF expressions, persistent UPS impairment and excess Aβ accumulation in the hippocampus. © 2017 The Author(s).","Amyloid β; Cerebral toxocariasis; Hippocampus; Mice; Neurodegeneration; Toxocara canis; Ubiquitin-proteasome system; Zoonosis",Article,Scopus

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of TLR7/8 stimulation of intestinal epithelium in shaping the phenotype and functions of innate immunity cell subsets, and to define direct and/or epithelial cell-mediated mechanisms of the TLR7/8 agonist R848 immunomodulatory activity. We describe novel, TLR8-mediated, pro- and anti-inflammatory effects of R848 on ex vivo cultured human blood monocytes and γδ T lymphocytes, either induced by direct immune cell stimulation or mediated by intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). Apical stimulation with R848 led to its transport across normal polarized epithelial cell monolayer and resulted in the inhibition of monocyte differentiation toward immunostimulatory dendritic cells and Th1 type response. Furthermore, γδ T lymphocyte activation was promoted following direct exposure of these cells to the agonist. Conversely, a selective enrichment of the CD14+CD16+ monocyte subpopulation was observed, which required a CCL2-mediated inflammatory response of normal epithelial cells to R848. Of note, a TLR-mediated activation of control γδ T lymphocytes was promoted by inflamed intestinal epithelium from active Crohn's disease patients. This study unravels a novel regulatory mechanism linking the activation of the TLR8 pathway in IEC to the monocyte-mediated inflammatory response, and highlights the capacity of the TLR7/8 agonist R848 to directly enhance the activation of γδ T lymphocytes. Overall these results expand the range of cell targets and immune responses controlled by TLR8 triggering that may contribute to the antiviral response, to chronic inflammation, as well as to the adjuvant activity of TLR8 agonists, highlighting the role of intestinal epithelium microenvironment in shaping TLR agonist-induced responses. © 2017 Angelini, Varano, Puddu, Fiori, Baldassarre, Masotti, Gessani and Conti.","Adjuvant; Cell activation; Inflammation; Microenvironment; Pathogen recognition",Article,Scopus

In this context, in an effort to better define this patient population and to develop more organized treatment strategies, the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) developed a concise set of criteria for this diagnostic category (mostly serous type): Both ovaries must be either physiologically normal in size or enlarged by a benign process, involvement in the extraovarian sites must be greater than involvement on the surface of either ovary, being of microscopic ovarian component. Actually, disseminated carcinomatosis on peritoneal surfaces is heterogenous clinic entity and gastrointestinal tract, lung, breast or genital system may cause malignant deposits. Primary peritoneal cancer patients show great similarities with advanced stage ovarian cancer patients as clinically, histologically and molecularly. Therefore, there has been significant progress on the pathogenesis recently. When salpingo-oopherectomy specimens have been examined in patients with hereditary breast ovary cancer syndrome, serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) foci were found. For this reason, it has been proven that both advanced stage serous ovarian cancers and the majority of peritoneal cancers began as tubal.

These days, DNA methylation has been proved to be associated with cancer prognosis. However, there are few methods which identify the prognostic markers based on DNA methylation data systematically, especially considering the interaction among DNA methylation sites. Methods: In this paper, we first evaluated the stabilities of microRNA, mRNA, and DNA methylation data in prognosis of cancer. After that, a rank-based method was applied to construct a DNA methylation interaction network. In this network, nodes with the largest degrees (10% of all the nodes) were selected as hubs. Cox regression was applied to select the hubs as prognostic signature. In this prognostic signature, DNA methylation levels of each DNA methylation site are correlated with the outcomes of cancer patients. After obtaining these prognostic genes, we performed the survival analysis in the training group and the test group to verify the reliability of these genes. Results: We applied our method in three cancers (ovarian cancer, breast cancer and Glioblastoma Multiforme). In all the three cancers, there are more common ones of prognostic genes selected from different samples in DNA methylation data, compared with gene expression data and miRNA expression data, which indicates the DNA methylation data may be more stable in cancer prognosis. Power-law distribution fitting suggests that the DNA methylation interaction networks are scale-free. And the hubs selected from the three networks are all enriched by cancer related pathways. The gene signatures were obtained for the three cancers respectively, and survival analysis shows they can distinguish the outcomes of tumor patients in both the training data sets and test data sets, which outperformed the control signatures. Conclusions: A computational method was proposed to construct DNA methylation interaction network and this network could be used to select prognostic signatures in cancer. © 2017 The Author(s).","Biomarker; Cancer prognosis; DNA methylation interaction network; Systems biology",Article,Scopus

The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic implications of RBM3 expression in gastric cancer. Material/Methods: Immunohistochemical analysis of RBM3 expression from 123 patients showed that upregulated RBM3 was mainly found in intestinal-type (n=78, case=59) cancer compared to diffuse-type (n=15, case=8) and mixedtype (n=30, case=17). There were no significant differences in RBM3 expression in subgroups of clinicopathological parameters. RBM3 expression was strongly associated with p53 but not with Ki-67. Cox univariate analysis revealed that high RBM3 expression was closely associated with prolonged overall survival time (HR 0.504, 95% CI: 0.300-0.845, P=0.009). Multivariate analysis remained supporting these associations when adjusted for age, sex, tumor size, differentiation grade, TNM stage, lymphatic invasion, and Ki-67 and p53 expression (HR 0.541, 95% CI: 0.308-0.952, P=0.033), where Lauren grade was not included. Lauren grade was the only factor with independent prognostic significance in a model adjusted for all factors. These results were confirmed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: Therefore, together with the upregulated RBM3 expression observed in intestinal-type of Lauren grade, we suggest that upregulation of RBM3 is partially responsible for the favorable overall survival in cases with intestinal Lauren grade, which is demonstrated by the box diagram and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Our results showed that high RBM3 expression in gastric cancer is mainly found in intestinal-type of Lauren grade and is associated with longer overall survival time. Conclusion: We found that RBM3 is a potential biomarker of good prognosis and deserves further validation. © Med Sci Monit, 2017.","Intestinal diseases; Prognosis; RNA-binding proteins; Stomach neoplasms",Article,Scopus

However, resistance typically develops in about 1 year – a clinical condition termed metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We develop and investigate a spatial game (agent based continuous space) of mCRPC that considers three distinct cancer cell types: (1) those dependent on exogenous testosterone (T+), (2) those with increased CYP17A expression that produce testosterone and provide it to the environment as a public good (TP), and (3) those independent of testosterone (T−). The interactions within and between cancer cell types can be represented by a 3 × 3 matrix. Based on the known biology of this cancer there are 22 potential matrices that give roughly three major outcomes depending upon the absence (good prognosis), near absence or high frequency (poor prognosis) of T− cells at the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). When just two cell types coexist the spatial game faithfully reproduces the ESS of the corresponding matrix game. With three cell types divergences occur, in some cases just two strategies coexist in the spatial game even as a non-spatial matrix game supports all three. Discrepancies between the spatial game and non-spatial ESS happen because different cell types become more or less clumped in the spatial game – leading to non-random assortative interactions between cell types. Three key spatial scales influence the distribution and abundance of cell types in the spatial game: i. Increasing the radius at which cells interact with each other can lead to higher clumping of each type, ii. Increasing the radius at which cells experience limits to population growth can cause densely packed tumor clusters in space, iii. Increasing the dispersal radius of daughter cells promotes increased mixing of cell types. To our knowledge the effects of these spatial scales on eco-evolutionary dynamics have not been explored in cancer models. The fact that cancer interactions are spatially explicit and that our spatial game of mCRPC provides in general different outcomes than the non-spatial game might suggest that non-spatial models are insufficient for capturing key elements of tumorigenesis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Evolutionary game theory; Non-spatial game; Prostate cancer; Spatial game",Article,Scopus

The availability of these diverse data types makes it necessary to combine these data to capture the heterogeneity of biological processes and phenotypes and further identify homogeneous subtypes for cancers such as breast cancer. Many multi-view clustering approaches are proposed to discover clusters across different data types. The problem is challenging when different data types show poor agreement of clustering structure. Results: In this work, we first propose a multi-view clustering approach with consensus (CMC), which tries to find consensus kernels among views by using Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion. To tackle the problem when poor agreement among views exists, we further propose a multi-view clustering approach with enhanced consensus (ECMC) to solve this problem by decomposing the kernel information in each view into a consensus part and a disagreement part. The consensus parts for different views are supposed to be similar, and the disagreement parts should be independent with the consensus parts. Both the CMC and ECMC models can be solved by alternative updating with semi-definite programming. Our experiments on both simulation datasets and real-world benchmark datasets show that ECMC model could achieve higher clustering accuracies than other state-of-art multi-view clustering approaches. We also apply the ECMC model to integrate mRNA expression, DNA methylation and microRNA (miRNA) expression data for five cancer data sets, and the survival analysis show that our ECMC model outperforms other methods when identifying cancer subtypes. By Fisher's combination test method, we found that three computed subtypes roughly correspond to three known breast cancer subtypes including luminal B, HER2 and basal-like subtypes. Conclusion: Integrating heterogeneous TCGA datasets by our proposed multi-view clustering approach ECMC could effectively identify cancer subtypes. © 2017 The Author(s).","Multi-view clustering; Subtype identification",Article,Scopus

High expression of circ-LDLRAD3 was significantly associated with venous invasion, lymphatic invasion, and metastasis. The area under the ROC curve of circ-LDLRAD3 alone or combination with CA19-9 was 0.67 and 0.87, respectively, with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.5738 (alone) and 0.7049 (alone), and 0.8033 (combination) and 0.9355 (combination), respectively.

Consequently, increased production of these highly reactive molecules requires coupling with increased antioxidant defense production within cells. This coupling is observed in cancer cells that allocate significant energy reserves to maintain their intracellular redox balance. Glutathione (GSH), as a first line of defense, represents the most important, non-enzymatic antioxidant component together with the NADPH/NADP+ couple, which ensures the maintenance of the pool of reduced GSH. In this review, the central role of amino acids (AAs) in the maintenance of redox homeostasis in cancer, through GSH synthesis (cysteine, glutamate, and glycine), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) production (serine, and glutamine/glutamate) are illustrated. Special emphasis is placed on the importance of AA transporters known to be upregulated in cancers (such as system xc-light chain and alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 2) in the maintenance of AA homeostasis, and thus indirectly, the redox homeostasis of cancer cells. The role of the ROS varies (often described as a ""two-edged sword"") during the processes of carcinogenesis, metastasis, and cancer treatment. Therefore, the context-dependent role of specific AAs in the initiation, progression, and dissemination of cancer, as well as in the redox-dependent sensitivity/resistance of the neoplastic cells to chemotherapy are highlighted. © 2017 Vučetić, Cormerais, Parks and Pouysségur.","Amino acids; Cancer; Glutathione; NADPH/NADP+; Redox homeostasis",Review,Scopus

A major application of connectivity mapping is the identification of small molecule compounds capable of inhibiting a disease state. In this study, we are additionally interested in small molecule compounds that may enhance a disease state or increase the risk of developing that disease. Using breast cancer as a case study, we aim to develop and test a methodology for identifying commonly prescribed drugs that may have a suppressing or inducing effect on the target disease (breast cancer). Results: We obtained from public data repositories a collection of breast cancer gene expression datasets with over 7000 patients. An integrated meta-analysis approach to gene expression connectivity mapping was developed, which involved unified processing and normalization of raw gene expression data, systematic removal of batch effects, and multiple runs of balanced sampling for differential expression analysis. Differentially expressed genes stringently selected were used to construct multiple non-joint gene signatures representing the same biological state. Remarkably these non-joint gene signatures retrieved from connectivity mapping separate lists of candidate drugs with significant overlaps, providing high confidence in their predicted effects on breast cancers. Of particular note, among the top 26 compounds identified as inversely connected to the breast cancer gene signatures, 14 of them are known anti-cancer drugs. Conclusions: A few candidate drugs with potential to enhance breast cancer or increase the risk of the disease were also identified; further investigation on a large population is required to firmly establish their effects on breast cancer risks. This work thus provides a novel approach and an applicable example for identifying medications with potential to alter cancer risks through gene expression connectivity mapping. © 2017 The Author(s).","Breast cancer; Connectivity mapping; Differentially expressed genes; Disease inhibitory compounds; Gene signature progression",Article,Scopus

Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs), particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), regulate several cellular processes and have an important role in many human malignancies including PCa. We assessed the sRNA profiles associated with PCa in Arabs, a population that has rarely been studied. Methods: We used next generation sequencing technology to obtain the entire sRNA transcriptome of primary prostate tumor formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, and their paired non-tumor tissues, collected from Bedouin patients (Qatari and Saudi). The miRNA and the target gene expression were evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR. miRNA KEGG pathway and miRNA target genes were subsequently analyzed by starBase and TargetScan software. Results: Different expression patterns of several sRNA and miRNA editing were revealed between PCa tumor and their paired non-tumor tissues. Our study identified four miRNAs that are strongly associated with prostate cancer, which have not been reported previously. Differentially expressed miRNAs significantly affect various biological pathways, such as cell cycle, endocytosis, adherence junction and pathways involved in cancer. Prediction of potential targets for the identified miRNAs indicates the overexpression of KRAS, BCL2 and down-regulation of PTEN in PCa tumor tissues. Conclusion: These miRNAs, newly associated with prostate cancer, may represent not only markers for the increased risk of PCa in Arabs, but may also reflect the clinical and pathological diversity as well as the ethno-specific heterogeneity of prostate cancer. © 2017 The Author(s).","Arabs; MiRNA; MiRNA editing; Prostate cancer; Small RNA transcriptome",Article,Scopus

The design, simulation and electrical characterization of an Ion Measuring Field Effect Transistors (IMFETs) are shown that detect cancer cells based on their molecular bioelectricity. IMFETs generate low impedance signals and consume low power because of the transistor properties.

It is of great necessity to develop effective methods for breast cancer detection and diagnosis. Recent studies have focused on gene-based signatures for outcome predictions. Kernel SVM for its discriminative power in dealing with small sample pattern recognition problems has attracted a lot attention. But how to select or construct an appropriate kernel for a specified problem still needs further investigation. Results: Here we propose a novel kernel (Hadamard Kernel) in conjunction with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to address the problem of breast cancer outcome prediction using gene expression data. Hadamard Kernel outperform the classical kernels and correlation kernel in terms of Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) values where a number of real-world data sets are adopted to test the performance of different methods. Conclusions: Hadamard Kernel SVM is effective for breast cancer predictions, either in terms of prognosis or diagnosis. It may benefit patients by guiding therapeutic options. Apart from that, it would be a valuable addition to the current SVM kernel families.

They are currently being used as the first-choice to treat some of the most frequent metastatic cancers, like HER2+ breast cancers or colorectal cancers, currently treated with trastuzumab (Herceptin) and bevacizumab (Avastin), respectively. The impressive therapeutic success of antibodies inhibiting immune checkpoints has extended the use of therapeutic antibodies to previously unanticipated tumor types. These anti-immune checkpoint antibodies allowed the cure of patients devoid of other therapeutic options, through the recovery of the patient's own immune response against the tumor. In this review, we describe how the antibody-based therapies will evolve, including the use of antibodies in combinations, their main characteristics, advantages, and how they could contribute to significantly increase the chances of success in cancer therapy. Indeed, novel combinations will consist of mixtures of antibodies against either different epitopes of the same molecule or different targets on the same tumor cell; bispecific or multispecific antibodies able of simultaneously binding tumor cells, immune cells or extracellular molecules; immunomodulatory antibodies; antibody-based molecules, including fusion proteins between a ligand or a receptor domain and the IgG Fab or Fc fragments; autologous or heterologous cells; and different formats of vaccines. Through complementary mechanisms of action, these combinations could contribute to elude the current limitations of a single antibody which recognizes only one particular epitope. These combinations may allow the simultaneous attack of the cancer cells by using the help of the own immune cells and exerting wider therapeutic effects, based on a more specific, fast, and robust response, trying to mimic the action of the immune system. © 2017 Corraliza-Gorjón, Somovilla-Crespo, Santamaria, Garcia-Sanz and Kremer.","Antibody combinations; Cancer; Immunotherapy; Oncology; Therapeutic antibodies",Review,Scopus

We investigated the associations of the NLR and PLR with the clinical parameters and prognoses of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients. Methods: Pre-treatment clinical and laboratory data from 139 patients with SCLC were retrospectively studied with univariate analyses. The NLR and PLR values were divided into two separate groups: high NLR (>4.55, n=32) vs low NLR (≤4.55, n=107) and high PLR (>148, n=63) vs low PLR (≤148, n=76). Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the effects of NLR and PLR on overall survival. Results: Chi-square analyses revealed significant associations of high NLR with tumour stage, hepatic metastasis, radiotherapy and chemotherapy and significant associations of high PLR with tumour stage, bone and hepatic metastases, exposure to cooking oil fumes, and chemotherapy. Mann-Whitney U tests demonstrated an association of high NLR with smoking exposure, and high NLR and high PLR were correlated with several laboratory parameters. Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that high NLR and high PLR conferred poor prognoses for SCLC patients. Moreover, multivariate analysis demonstrated that NLR, tumour stage, and hepatic metastasis were independent prognostic factors for survival. In this study, we found that NLR and PLR were associated with several factors that reflect the inflammatory (white blood cell count, WBC; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH) and nutritional (albumin, ALB; haemoglobin, HB; and cholesterol) status of SCLC patients at diagnosis. Conclusions: NLR is an independent prognostic factor and can be used to predict the mortality risk of SCLC patients. © 2017 The Author(s).","Mortality risk; Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio; Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio; Prognosis; Small cell lung cancer",Article,Scopus

In this work, we constructed nanohybrid Ru1@CDs composed of carbon nanodots (CDs) and a phosphorescent Ru(ii) complex (Ru1) for one- and two-photon photodynamic therapy of cancer. The photosensitizer and imaging agent Ru1 is decorated onto the nanocarrier CDs covalently. Ru1 and Ru1@CDs can penetrate into cancer cells through an energy-dependent mechanism and endocytosis, respectively. Both Ru1 and Ru1@CDs are capable of lysosome-targeted phosphorescence imaging and photodamage under either 450 nm (one-photon) or 810 nm (two-photon) excitation. Conjugation with CDs can increase the cellular uptake efficacy of Ru1. Mechanism investigations show that both Ru1 and Ru1@CDs can induce apoptosis through generation of reactive oxygen species and cathepsin-initiated apoptotic signaling pathways. Upon two-photon excitation, Ru1@CDs show better penetrability, as well as higher inhibitory effects on cancer cell growth in both 2D cell and 3D multicellular tumor spheroid models.

METHODS Stool samples were collected from 87 Finnish patients diagnosed with various gastric and colorectal neoplasms, including benign tumors, and from 14 healthy controls. DNA was isolated from stools by using the PSP® Spin Stool DNA Plus Kit. For each sample, 20 ng of DNA was used to construct sequencing libraries using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 or Ion AmpliSeq Colon and Lung Cancer panel v2. Sequencing was performed on Ion PGM. Torrent Suite Software v.5.2.2 was used for variant calling and data analysis. RESULTS NGS was successful in assaying 72 GIT samples and 13 healthy controls, with success rates of the assay being 78% for stomach neoplasia and 87% for colorectal tumors. In stool specimens from patients with gastric neoplasia, five hotspot mutations were found in APC , CDKN2A and EGFR genes, in addition to seven novel mutations. From colorectal patients, 20 mutations were detected in AKT1 , APC , ERBB2 , FBXW7 , KIT , KRAS , NRAS , SMARCB1 , SMO , STK11 and TP53 . Healthy controls did not exhibit any hotspot mutations, except for two novel ones. APC and TP53 were the most frequently mutated genes in colorectal neoplasms, with five mutations, followed by KRAS with two mutations. APC was the most commonly mutated gene in stools of patients with premalignant/benign GIT lesions. CONCLUSION Our results show that in addition to colorectal neoplasms, mutations can also be assayed from stool specimens of patients with gastric neoplasms. © The Author(s) 2017.

In some cases, specific chemotherapies and targeted drug treatments are effective against tumors that harbor certain genomic aberrations. However, predictive aberrations (biomarkers) have not been identified for many tumor types and treatments. One way to address this problem is to examine the downstream, transcriptional effects of genomic aberrations and to identify characteristic patterns. Even though two tumors harbor different genomic aberrations, the transcriptional effects of those aberrations may be similar. These patterns could be used to inform treatment choices. Methods: We used data from 9300 tumors across 25 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We used supervised machine learning to evaluate our ability to distinguish between tumors that had mutually exclusive genomic aberrations in specific genes. An ability to accurately distinguish between tumors with aberrations in these genes suggested that the genes have a relatively different downstream effect on transcription, and vice versa. We compared these findings against prior knowledge about signaling networks and drug responses. Results: Our analysis recapitulates known relationships in cancer pathways and identifies gene pairs known to predict responses to the same treatments. For example, in lung adenocarcinomas, gene-expression profiles from tumors with somatic aberrations in EGFR or MET were negatively correlated with each other, in line with prior knowledge that MET amplification causes resistance to EGFR inhibition. In breast carcinomas, we observed high similarity between PTEN and PIK3CA, which play complementary roles in regulating cellular proliferation. In a pan-cancer analysis, we found that genomic aberrations in BRAF and VHL exhibit downstream effects that are clearly distinct from other genes. Conclusion: We show that transcriptional data offer promise as a way to group genomic aberrations according to their downstream effects, and these groupings recapitulate known relationships. Our approach shows potential to help pharmacologists and clinical trialists narrow the search space for candidate gene/drug associations, including for rare mutations, and for identifying potential drug-repurposing opportunities. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cancer genomics; Drug repurposing; Integrative omics; Machine learning; Pan cancer",Article,Scopus

Despite some controversies regarding such role, new evidence is suggesting a culpability of EBV in breast cancer, particularly in Africa where the virus has been originally associated with causation of several solid and hematological malignancies. One example is a report from Sudan implicating EBV as a prime etiologic agent for an aggressive type of breast cancer, where nearly 100% of tumor tissues were shown to carry viral signatures. To get a broader view on such association, other nearby countries should be investigated. The present study aims to determine the prevalence and possible associations of the virus in Eritrean breast cancer patients. Methods: Detection of EBV genome using primers that target Epstein Barr Encoded RNA (EBER) gene and Latent Membrane Protein-1 (LMP-1) gene sequences was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on DNA samples extracted from 144 formalin fixed paraffin embedded breast cancer tissues and 63 non-cancerous breast tissue as control group. A subset of PCR positive samples was evaluated for EBER gene expression by in situ hybridization (ISH). Expression of Latent Membrane Protein-2a (LMP2a) was also assessed by immunohistochemistry in a subset of 45 samples. Results: Based on PCR results, EBV genome signals were detected in a total of 40 samples (27.77%) as compared to controls (p-value = 0. 0031) with a higher sensitivity when using the EBER primers. Five out of the 14 samples stained by EBER-ISH 35.71% were positive for the virus indicating the presence of the viral genome within the tumor cells. Of those stained for IHC 7 (15.55%) were positive for LMP2a showing low viral protein frequency.

After a median observation period of approximately 6 years from first treatment, we examined the durability of remission, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety outcomes of patients treated on this trial. Among all enrolled patients (n558), no progressions were observed beyond 40months, and median OS was not reached. Patients with a complete response (CR), as assessed by the investigator (38 of 58, 66%), continued to demonstrate improved outcomes with neither median OS nor PFS reached. Of the 38 CR patients, 16 received a consolidative stem cell transplant (SCT) with median PFS not reached. Among patients who were on-study and in remission at study closure, 16 patients had not received any new treatment after single-Agent brentuximab vedotin other than consolidative SCT. Among this subset of 16 patients, 8 received SCT, and the remaining 8 patients(14% of all enrolledpatients)remained in sustained remissionwithoutconsolidative SCT or any new anticancer therapy. Thirty-Three patients experienced peripheral neuropathy, among whom, the majority (30 of 33, 91%) had experienced resolution or improvement at their last assessment. These final results, which demonstrated a high rate of peripheral neuropathy resolution, and durable remissions in a subset of patients with relapsed or refractory systemic ALCL, provide evidence that single-Agent brentuximab vedotin may be a potentially curative treatment option. © 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.",,Article,Scopus

Successful application of MPI for imaging of cancer depends on the nanoparticles (NPs) accumulating at tumors at sufficient levels relative to other sites. NPs' physiochemical properties such as size, crystallographic structure and uniformity, surface coating, stability, blood circulation time and magnetization determine the efficacy of their tumor accumulation and MPI signal generation. Here, we address these criteria by presenting strategies for the synthesis and surface functionalization of efficient MPI tracers, that can target a typical murine brain cancer model and generate three dimensional images of these tumors with very high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Our results showed high contrast agent sensitivities that enabled us to detect 1.1 ng of iron (SNR ∼ 3.9) and enhance the spatial resolution to about 600 μm. The biodistribution of these NPs was also studied using near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. NPs were mainly accumulated in the liver and spleen and did not show any renal clearance.

However, 25% of these biopsies render an indeterminate cytology, leaving uncertainty regarding appropriate management. Individualizing the risk of malignancy of these nodules could improve their management significantly. We summarize the current evidence on the relevance of clinical information, radiological features, cytological features, and molecular markers tests results and describe how these can be integrated to personalize the management of thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology. Several factors can be used to stratify the risk of malignancy in thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology. Male gender, large tumors (>4 cm), suspicious sonographic patterns, and the presence of nuclear atypia on the cytology are all associated with an increased cancer prevalence. The added value of current molecular markers in the risk stratification process needs further study because their performance seems compromised in some clinical settings and remains to be validated in others. Risk stratification is possible in thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology using data that are often underused by current guidelines.

However, pelvic nodes or local recurrences can be difficult to differentiate from radioactive urine. CT urography (CT-U) is an established method, which allows assessment of urological malignancies. The study presents a novel protocol of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT-U in PS and BCR of PC. Methods: A retrospective review of PSMA PET/CT-U preformed on 57 consecutive patients with prostate cancer. Fifty mL of IV contrast was administered 10 min (range 8-15) before the CT component of a combined PET/CT study, acquired approximately 60 min (range 40-85) after administration of 166 MBq (range 91-246) of 68Ga-PSMA-11. PET and PET/CT-U were reviewed by two nuclear medicine physicians and CT-U by a radiologist. First, PET images were reviewed independently followed by PET/CT-U images. Foci of activity which could not unequivocally be assessed as disease or urinary activity were recorded. PET/CT-U was considered of potential benefit in final interpretation when the equivocal focal activity in PET images corresponded to opacified ureter, bladder, prostate bed, seminal vesicles, or urethra. Student's T test and Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for assessment of variables including lymph node size and standardized uptake value. Results: Overall 50 PSMA PET/CT-U studies were performed for BCR and 7 for PS. Median PSA with BCR and PS were 2.0 ± 11.4 ng/ml (0.06-57.3 ng/ml) and 18 ± 35.3 ng/ml (6.8-100 ng/ml), respectively. The median Gleason-score for both groups was 7 (range 6-10). In BCR group, PSMA PET was reported positive in 36 (72%) patients, CT-U in 11(22%) patients and PET/CT-U in 33 (66%) patients. In PS group, PSMA PET detected the primary site in all seven patients, of which one patient with metastatic nodal disease had negative CT finding. Of 40 equivocal foci (27/57 patients) on PET, 11 foci (10/57 patients, 17.5%) were localized to enhanced urine on PET/CT-U, hence considered of potential benefit in interpretation. Of those, 3 foci (3 patients) were solitary sites of activity on PSMA imaging including two local and one nodal site and 4 foci (3 patients) were in different nodal fields. Conclusions: PET/CT-U protocol is a practical approach and may assist in interpretation of 68Ga-PSMA-11 imaging by delineation of the contrast opacified genitourinary system and matching focal PSMA activity with urinary contrast. © 2017 The Author(s).","68Ga-PSMA-11 PET; Biochemical recurrence; CT urogram; Prostate cancer; PSMA PET/CT; PSMA-HBED PET",Article,Scopus

Their identification, phenotyping, and genotyping could lead to a better understanding of tumor heterogeneity and thus facilitate the selection of patients for personalized treatment. However, this is hampered because of the rarity of CTCs. We present an innovative approach for sampling a high volume of the patient blood and obtaining information about presence, phenotype, and gene translocation of CTCs. The method combines immunofluorescence staining and DNA fluorescent-in-situ-hybridization (DNA FISH) and is based on a functionalized medical wire. This wire is an innovative device that permits the in vivo isolation of CTCs from a large volume of peripheral blood. The blood volume screened by a 30-min administration of the wire is approximately 1.5-3 L. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) expression and the chromosomal translocation of the ALK gene were determined in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines captured by the functionalized wire and stained with an immuno-DNA FISH approach. Our main challenge was to perform the assay on a 3D structure, the functionalized wire, and to determine immuno-phenotype and FISH signals on this support using a conventional fluorescence microscope. The results obtained indicate that catching CTCs and analyzing their phenotype and chromosomal rearrangement could potentially represent a new companion diagnostic approach and provide an innovative strategy for improving personalized cancer treatments. © 2017, Journal of Visualized Experiments.

Tumors which remodel their glycocalyces, by overexpressing bulky glycoproteins like mucins, exhibit a higher predisposition to metastasize, but the role of mucins in oncogenesis remains poorly understood. Here we report that a bulky glycocalyx promotes the expansion of disseminated tumor cells in vivo by fostering integrin adhesion assembly to permit G1 cell cycle progression. We engineered tumor cells to display glycocalyces of various thicknesses by coating them with synthetic mucin-mimetic glycopolymers. Cells adorned with longer glycopolymers showed increased metastatic potential, enhanced cell cycle progression, and greater levels of integrin-FAK mechanosignaling and Akt signaling in a syngeneic mouse model of metastasis. These effects were mirrored by expression of the ectodomain of cancer-associated mucin MUC1. These findings functionally link mucinous proteins with tumor aggression, and offer a new view of the cancer glycocalyx as a major driver of disease progression. © Woods et al.",,Article,Scopus

PRR-mediated antimicrobial signals provide robust type-I IFN/cytokine production and trigger inflammation, thereby affecting tumor progression and autoimmune diseases. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that among the PRRs, only the signaling pathway of endosomal toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) induces no systemic inflammation and mediates cross-priming of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells by dendritic cells. Treatment with a newly developed TLR3-specific ligand, ARNAX, along with tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), induces tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, modulates the tumor microenvironment to establish Th1-type antitumor immunity, and leads to tumor regression without inflammation in mouse tumor models. Combination therapy using ARNAX/TAA and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade potently enhances antitumor response and overcomes anti-PD-1/PD-L1 resistance.

Moreover, we evaluate the potential efficacy of this modified DC vaccine as secondary aim. Methods: The patients were treated with the vaccine at 1×10 6 , 1×10 7 and the maximum dose 8×10 7 at day 7, 14, and 21 after characterization of the vaccine phenotype by flow cytometry. The safety of the vaccine was assessed by adverse events, and the efficacy by the levels of several specific tumor markers and the patient quality of life. Results: The vaccine was well tolerated without dose-limiting toxicity even at higher doses. The most common adverse event reported was just grade 1 flu-like symptoms without unanticipated or serious adverse event. A significant decrease in CD3+CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cell number and increase in TNF-α and IL-6 were observed in two patients. Two patients showed 15% and 64% decrease in carcino-embryonic antigen and CYFRA21, respectively. The vaccination with the maximum dose significantly improved the patients'quality of life when administered at the highest dose. More importantly, in the long-term follow-up until February 17, 2017, 1 patient had no recurrence, 1 patients had a progressive disease (PD), and 1 patient was died in the low dose group. In the middle dose group, all 3 patients had no recurrence. In the high dose group, 1 patient was died, 1 patient had a PD, and the other 7 patients had no recurrence. Conclusions: We provide preliminary data on the safety and efficacy profile of a novel vaccine against non-small cell lung cancer, which was reasonably well tolerated, induced modest antitumor activity without dose-limiting toxicity, and improved patients' quality of life. Further more, the vaccine maybe a very efficacious treatment for patients with resected NSCLC to prevent recurrence.

However, the low sensitivity of US for small HCC can lead to surveillance failure, resulting in advanced stage tumor presentations. For the early detection of HCC in high-risk patients and to improve survival and prognosis, a new efficient imaging tool with a high sensitivity for HCC detection is needed. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the feasibility and efficacy of non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with US as a surveillance tool for HCC in patients with liver cirrhosis. Methods: MAGNUS-HCC is a prospective, multicenter clinical trial with a crossover design for a single arm of patients. This study was approved by six Institutional Review Boards, and informed consent was obtained from all participants. All patients will undergo liver US every 6months and non-contrast liver MRI every 12months during a follow-up period of 3years. If a focal liver lesion suspected of harboring HCC is detected, dynamic liver computed tomography (CT) will be performed to confirm the diagnosis. After the last surveillance round, patients without suspicion of HCC or who are not diagnosed with HCC will be evaluated with a dynamic liver CT to exclude false-negative findings. The primary endpoint is to compare the rate of detection of HCC by US examinations performed at 6-month intervals with that of yearly non-contrast liver MRI studies during a 3-year follow-up. The secondary endpoint is the survival of the patients who developed HCC within the 3-year follow-up period. Discussion: MAGNUS-HCC is the first study to compare the feasibility of non-contrast MRI with US as a surveillance tool for the detection of HCC in high-risk patients.

Chronic inflammation might play important roles in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are often recruited to the tumor microenvironment due to local inflammation. We have asked whether stimulation of MSCs by pro-inflammatory cytokines could promote prostate tumor growth. The current study investigated the possible involvement of MSCs stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines in promotion and angiogenesis of prostate cancer through relative pathway in vitro and in vivo. Methods: A syngeneic mouse model of C57 was established. The murine prostate cancer cells (RM-1) mixing with MSCs treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) or vehicle were subcutaneously injected into C57 mice. Tumor volume of C57 mouse model was estimated and serum level of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was test by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). A hen egg test-chorioallantoic membrane (HET-CAM) assay was applied to test the effect of conditioned media of stimulated MSCs in chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) knocked down either hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1α) or nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2) were employed. mRNA of PDGF and VEGF in MSCs, as well as NRF2 and HIF-1α was test by Real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses. Protein expression levels of PDGF and VEGF from conditioned medium, NRF2, HIF-1α, as well as PDGF and VEGF in MSCs were detected by Western blot analysis. Results: MSCs treated with TNF-α and IFN-γ promote tumor growth in C57 syngeneic mouse model, correlating with increased serum level of PDGF, VEGF. HET-CAM assay shows the angiogenic effect of conditioned medium of MSCs pre-treated with the pro-inflammatory cytokines. mRNA and protein levels of two pro-angiogenic factors (PDGF and VEGF) and key hypoxia regulators (HIF-1α and NRF2) in MSCs were induced after MSCs' pretreatment. siRNA knockdown either HIF-1α or NRF2 results reduction of PDGF and VEGF expression. Conclusions: MSCs stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines increase the expression of PDGF and VEGF via the NRF2-HIF-1α pathway and accelerate prostate cancer growth in mice. © 2017 The Author(s).","Angiogenesis; HIF-1α; Inflammation; Mesenchymal stem cells; NRF2; PDGF; Prostate cancer; VEGF",Article,Scopus

The LINCS public data warehouse provides detailed information about cell responses with various genetic and environmental stressors. It can be greatly helpful in developing new drugs and therapeutics, as well as improving the situations of lacking effective drugs, drug resistance and relapse in cancer therapies, etc. Results: In this study, we developed a Ternary status based Integer Linear Programming (TILP) method to infer cell-specific signaling pathway network and predict compounds' treatment efficacy. The novelty of our study is that phosphor-proteomic data and prior knowledge are combined for modeling and optimizing the signaling network. To test the power of our approach, a generic pathway network was constructed for a human breast cancer cell line MCF7; and the TILP model was used to infer MCF7-specific pathways with a set of phosphor-proteomic data collected from ten representative small molecule chemical compounds (most of them were studied in breast cancer treatment). Cross-validation indicated that the MCF7-specific pathway network inferred by TILP were reliable predicting a compound's efficacy. Finally, we applied TILP to re-optimize the inferred cell-specific pathways and predict the outcomes of five small compounds (carmustine, doxorubicin, GW-8510, daunorubicin, and verapamil), which were rarely used in clinic for breast cancer. In the simulation, the proposed approach facilitates us to identify a compound's treatment efficacy qualitatively and quantitatively, and the cross validation analysis indicated good accuracy in predicting effects of five compounds. Conclusions: In summary, the TILP model is useful for discovering new drugs for clinic use, and also elucidating the potential mechanisms of a compound to targets. © 2017 The Author(s).","Compound; Linear programming; Prior knowledge; Signaling pathway; Treatment effect",Article,Scopus

Breast cancer statistics (n=339, confidence=95%, accuracy= ± 5.32%). The quality of life questionnaires (QLQ) used were QLQ C-30 and QLQ Br23, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used for anxiety. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify variables associated with baseline quality of life and anxiety as well as pre- and post-treatment differences. Authorization was obtained from the Ethics Committee, and informed consent was provided by all patients.RESULTS: the baseline quality of life dimensions with the lowest score were future prospects (46.0/100) and sexual enjoyment (55.7/100). The dimensions with the highest score were body image (94.2/100) and role (93.3/100). The most disturbing symptoms were insomnia, fatigue and concern about hair loss. After treatment, the dimensions of physical function, role, body image, financial concerns and symptomatology worsened, whereas emotional function and future prospects improved. Severe anxiety presented as a state (48.6%) and as a trait (18.2%). The highest baseline state anxiety was associated with married-widowed status and anxiolytic medication. The greatest trait anxiety was associated with an inactive work situation, anxiolytic medication, breast swelling and advanced stage at diagnosis.

METHODS Data were retrospectively collected from 142 patients who were diagnosed with gastric neuroendocrine neoplasms and who underwent radical gastrectomy at our department from March 2006 to March 2015. These data were retrospectively analyzed, and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to identify the optimal value of the tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were used to identify prognostic factors. A nomogram was then applied to predict clinical outcomes after surgery. RESULTS The tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly associated with tumor recurrence, especially with liver metastasis and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05 for both), but not with clinical characteristics (P > 0.05 for all). A multivariate Cox regression analysis identified the tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival and overall survival (P < 0.05 for both). The concordance index of the nomograms, which included the tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, Ki-67 index, and lymph node ratio, was 0.788 (0.759) for recurrence-free survival (overall survival) and was higher than the concordance index of the traditional TNM staging system [0.672 (0.663)]. CONCLUSION The tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is an independent prognostic factor in patients with gastric neuroendocrine neoplasms. Nomograms that include the tumor-associated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, Ki-67 index, and lymph node ratio have a superior ability to predict clinical outcomes of postoperative patients.",,Article,Scopus

The aim of the research was to provide data on the spatiotemporal changes in the contamination levels, compositional patterns, sources and human health risks linked with exposure to PAHs in these soils through non-dietary ingestion, inhalation and dermal contact pathways. The PAHs in the soil samples were extracted by ultrasonication with hexane/dichloromethane, followed by clean-up on a silica gel/alumina column, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used for their separation, detection and quantification. The concentrations of the 16 PAHs varied from 812 to 10,700 µg kg−1 in 2013 after an extreme flooding event, and from 12.2 to 2630 µg kg−1 in 2014 after a natural flooding event. The benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) potency factors and incremental life cancer risks (ILCR) were used to evaluate the risks of human exposure to PAHs in these soils. The average total ILCR values obtained for 2014 (a year after the extreme flooding) indicated that there was a probability of 443 children and 308 adults in a population of one million equally exposed individuals at risk of developing cancer or cancer-related illnesses in their lifetime as opposed to 6450 children and 4480 adults in 2013 immediately after the extreme flooding event.

However, the intrinsic limitations including non-quantitative detection of colloidal gold ICTS and low sensitivity of fluorescence ICTS (FICTS) significantly restrict their further application in clinical diagnosis. Taking advantages of rapid colorimetric qualitative detection and fluorescence quantitation, we designed a kind of sensitive and dual-mode magnetic FICTS (mFICTS) based on PLGA@Fe3O4 super-paramagnetic nanosphere (SPMN) probes quenching multiplex fluorescer on the test line through sandwich immunoreactions. Owing to the large number of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles (about 47) encapsulated in one SPMN, about 2680 Cy5 molecules were quenched by one SPMN on the test line such that to significantly improve the analytical sensitivity as well as the detection of whole blood samples via magnetic separation. Moreover, the aggregation of black SPMN on the test line enabled a quick naked-eye screening in 3 min. For high accuracy breast cancer diagnosis, combined determination of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA153) was performed on one mFICTS with the limits of detection of about 0.06 ng mL -1 and 0.09 U mL -1 , respectively. Then, more than 50 clinical serum samples were investigated for high-resolution screening by mFICTS, and the results were coincident with those obtained by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA).

However, the rarity and inherent fragility of CTCs pose great challenges for CTC detection. Currently, CTC detection requires advanced instruments that might be inaccessible in most hospitals or labs. To allow simple and rapid CTC detection, we propose a sensor platform that relies only on the intrinsic properties of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) including rapid separation as well as nanozyme activity. The detection of melanoma CTC, which causes most skin cancer-related deaths, is demonstrated based on bifunctional MNPs. The magnetic property of MNPs enables melanoma CTC isolation and enrichment within 5 min from blood. The nanozyme activity of MNPs allows naked-eye detection of melanoma CTC by catalyzing the oxidation of colourless 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) into blue coloured products. Melanoma CTC enumeration can be further achieved by UV-vis measurement. Our platform has successfully detected 13 melanoma CTCs per mL within 50 min. We thus believe this platform could find broad applications both in the clinic and in research. © This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Article,Scopus

Like patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), some of these patients present with “borderline resectable disease.” For these patients, an optimal treatment approach is lacking. We report our institution’s experience with borderline resectable PanNETs using multimodality treatment. Methods: We identified patients with borderline resectable PanNETs who had received neoadjuvant therapy at our institution between 2000 and 2013. The definition of borderline resectability was based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria for PDAC. Neoadjuvant regimen, radiographic response, pathologic response, surgical margins, nodal retrieval, number of positive nodes, and recurrence were documented. Statistics were descriptive. Results: Of 112 patients who underwent surgical resection for PanNETs during the study period, 23 received neoadjuvant therapy, 6 of whom met all inclusion criteria and had borderline resectable disease. These 6 patients received at least 1 cycle of temozolomide and capecitabine, with 3 also receiving radiation. All had radiographic evidence of treatment response. Four (67%) had negative-margin resections. Four patients had histologic evidence of a moderate response. Follow-up (3.0-4.3 years) indicated that all patients were alive, with 5/6 free of disease (1 patient with metastatic disease still on treatment without progression). Conclusions: A multimodality treatment strategy (neoadjuvant temozolomide and capecitabine ± radiation) can be successfully applied to patients with PanNETs who meet NCCN borderline resectable criteria for PDAC. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of a multimodality protocol in the treatment of patients with borderline resectable PanNETs. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","capecitabine; pancreatic cancer; radiation therapy; resectable disease; temozolomide",Article,Scopus

Methods: Serum samples were available for 20 patients with IgD multiple myeloma, 41 patients with light chain multiple myeloma and 42 healthy control subjects. Serum N-glycans were released and analysed using DNA sequencer-assisted fluorophore-assisted capillary electrophoresis. Results: Characteristic changes were revealed in the serum N-glycome of IgD myeloma. In particular, three N-glycans (NG1(6)A2F, Peak3; NG1(3)A2F, Peak4; NA2FB, Peak7) showed increased clinical value. The best area under the ROC curve of NG1(6)A2F to diagnose IgD myeloma was 0.981, with a 95.0% sensitivity and 95.2% specificity, and that of NG1(3)A2F was 0.936, with a 95.0% sensitivity and 78.6% specificity.

It contains the atypical kinase mTOR and the RAPTOR subunit that binds to the Tor signalling sequence (TOS) motif of substrates and regulators. mTORC1 is activated by the small GTPase RHEB (Ras homologue enriched in brain) and inhibited by PRAS40. Here we present the 3.0 ångström cryo-electron microscopy structure of mTORC1 and the 3.4 ångström structure of activated RHEB-mTORC1. RHEB binds to mTOR distally from the kinase active site, yet causes a global conformational change that allosterically realigns active-site residues, accelerating catalysis. Cancer-associated hyperactivating mutations map to structural elements that maintain the inactive state, and we provide biochemical evidence that they mimic RHEB relieving auto-inhibition. We also present crystal structures of RAPTOR-TOS motif complexes that define the determinants of TOS recognition, of an mTOR FKBP12-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain-substrate complex that establishes a second substrate-recruitment mechanism, and of a truncated mTOR-PRAS40 complex that reveals PRAS40 inhibits both substrate-recruitment sites.

However, the lack of structural information about the USP7-inhibitor interactions has been a critical gap in the development of potent inhibitors. USP7 is unique among USPs in that its active site is catalytically incompetent, and is postulated to rearrange into a productive conformation only upon binding to ubiquitin. Surprisingly, we found that ubiquitin alone does not induce an active conformation in solution. Using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry, computational modeling, and cell-based assays, we found that DUB inhibitors P22077 and P50429 covalently modify the catalytic cysteine of USP7 and induce a conformational switch in the enzyme associated with active site rearrangement. This work represents the first experimental insights into USP7 activation and inhibition and provides a structural basis for rational development of potent anti-cancer therapeutics.

METHODS We reviewed colonoscopy records at our institution from 2014 to 2016 and identified cases of endoscopically or surgically resected colorectal epithelial neoplasms observed by magnifying narrow-band imaging (M-NBI) colonoscopy. Immunohistochemistry was used to stain tumors with a monoclonal antibody specific to adipophilin as a marker of lipids. The expression and distribution of adipophilin were compared between WOS-positive and WOS-negative lesions and among tumors classified by histologic type and depth of invasion. RESULTS Under M-NBI colonoscopy, 81 lesions were positive for WOS and 48 lesions were negative for WOS. The rate of adipophilin expression was significantly higher in WOS-positive lesions (95.1%) than in WOS-negative lesions (68.7%) (P = 0.0001). The incidence of deep adipophilin expression was higher in WOS-positive lesions (24.7%) than in WOS-negative lesions (4.2%) (P = 0.001). The incidence of deep expression was predominant among cancers with massive submucosal invasion (62.5%) compared to adenoma (7.2%) and high-grade dysplasia or cancers with slight submucosal invasion (12.7%) (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION The distribution of lipid droplets may be closely associated with the visibility of WOS under M-NBI colonoscopy, and with histologic grade and depth of tumor invasion. © The Author(s) 2017.

Our glycan analysis using lectin and mass spectrometry demonstrated that 6-Alk-Fuc is a potent and general inhibitor of cellular fucosylation, with much higher potency than the existing inhibitor, 2-fluoro-fucose (2-F-Fuc). The action mechanism was shown to deplete cellular GDP-Fuc, and the direct target of 6-Alk-Fuc is FX (encoded by TSTA3), the bifunctional GDP-Fuc synthase.

However, in patients with cancer, both signals are frequently impaired. Hence, we developed a novel strategy that combines both essential signals in 1 transgene by expressing the nonlymphoid hematopoietic growth factor receptor c-MPL (myeloproliferative leukemia), the receptor for thrombopoietin (TPO), in T cells. c-MPL signaling activates pathways shared with conventional costimulatory and cytokine receptor signaling. Thus, we hypothesized that host-derived TPO, present in the tumor microenvironment, or pharmacological c-MPL agonists approved by the US Food and Drug Administration could deliver both signals to c-MPL-engineered TCR-Transgenic T cells. We found that c-MPL1 polyclonal T cells expand and proliferate in response to TPO, and persist longer after adoptive transfer in immunodeficient human TPO-Transgenic mice. In TCR-Transgenic T cells, c-MPL activation enhances antitumor function, T-cell expansion, and cytokine production and preserves a central memory phenotype. c-MPL signaling also enables sequential tumor cell killing, enhances the formation of effective immune synapses, and improves antileukemic activity in vivo in a leukemia xenograft model. We identify the type 1 interferon pathway as a molecular mechanism by which c-MPL mediates immune stimulation in T cells. In conclusion, we present a novel immunotherapeutic strategy using c-MPL-enhanced transgenic T cells responding to either endogenously produced TPO (a microenvironment factor in hematologic malignancies) or c-MPL-Targeted pharmacological agents. © 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.",,Article,Scopus

Sample variance is greatly reduced after normalization, hence the power of subsequent statistical analyses is likely to increase. On the other hand, variance reduction is made possible by borrowing information across all genes, including differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and outliers, which will inevitably introduce some bias. This bias typically inflates type I error and can reduce statistical power in certain situations. In this study we propose a new differential expression analysis pipeline, dubbed as super-delta, that consists of a multivariate extension of the global normalization and a modified t-test. A robust procedure is designed to minimize the bias introduced by DEGs in the normalization step. The modified t-test is derived based on asymptotic theory for hypothesis testing that suitably pairs with the proposed robust normalization. Results: We first compared super-delta with four commonly used normalization methods: global, median-IQR, quantile, and cyclic loess normalization in simulation studies. Super-delta was shown to have better statistical power with tighter control of type I error rate than its competitors. In many cases, the performance of super-delta is close to that of an oracle test in which datasets without technical noise were used. We then applied all methods to a collection of gene expression datasets on breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. While there is a substantial overlap of the DEGs identified by all of them, super-delta were able to identify comparatively more DEGs than its competitors. Downstream gene set enrichment analysis confirmed that all these methods selected largely consistent pathways. Detailed investigations on the relatively small differences showed that pathways identified by super-delta have better connections to breast cancer than other methods. Conclusions: As a new pipeline, super-delta provides new insights to the area of differential gene expression analysis. Solid theoretical foundation supports its asymptotic unbiasedness and technical noise-free properties. Implementation on real and simulated datasets demonstrates its decent performance compared with state-of-art procedures. It also has the potential of expansion to be incorporated with other data type and/or more general between-group comparison problems. © 2017 The Author(s).","Differential expression analysis; Gene expression; Modified t-test; Robust normalization; Super-delta",Article,Scopus

The purpose of this report is to evaluate a smart, biocompatible, magnetic nanocarrier for the intracellular co-delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) and methotrexate (MTX) to the MCF7 cell line. Since dendritic architecture based nanoparticles can load high doses of drugs with various properties, we evaluated dendritic chitosan grafted mPEG coated magnetic nanoparticles (DPC@MNPs) as a magnetic nanocarrier that has potential in multi-drug delivery. DPC@MNPs with high encapsulation efficiencies of 95.96% for DOX and 67.91% for MTX, has shown controlled and pH-dependent behaviour with tumor target release. After confirmation of the nanocarrier biocompatibility with human red blood cells by hemolysis assay, SDS-PAGE assay was performed to simulate how the nanocarrier interacts with proteins that exist in the blood circulation systems. The results show that several proteins in human blood plasma could attach to the nanocarrier surface and provide the nanocarrier with stealth properties that are suitable for drug delivery systems. An in vitro study of cell viability showed that combination drug delivery has synergistic effects and reduces toxic side effects. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity assay of the nanocarrier to the MCF7 cell line indicated that DPC@MNPs is suitable as an anticancer drug nanocarrier. Dual-drug delivery with efficient anticancer performance was also confirmed by DAPI staining, cellular uptake, cell cycle, and apoptosis analysis, compared to free dual anticancer drugs. To assess the healthy, apoptotic, and necrotic cells, DAPI staining and apoptosis analysis by flow-cytometry were conducted and all data showed that the apoptotic effects of the drug-loaded nanocarrier are higher in comparison to the corresponding free drugs. Cellular uptake was also examined to validate the internalization of the nanocarrier in the cells and the results have shown that a high uptake percentage was observed within 3 h. Finally, the side effects of the drug-loaded nanocarrier and free drugs were assessed using the mouse model and it was concluded that this combination therapy offers a promising approach to cancer treatment and can be used for further in vivo applications. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Article,Scopus

A continuous-flow analytical separation of analyte mixtures of small linear DNA-fragments (10.0 kbp, 8.0 kbp, 6.0 kbp, and 5.0 kbp) and topological DNA variants (linear and supercoiled conformation) was investigated. We present a world record in the minimal size difference of 16.7% of DNA samples that can be resolved in a dielectrophoretic continuous-flow separation. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time a microfluidic continuous-flow separation of DNA molecules based on their topological conformation.

Overexpression of Na+/H+ Exchanger isoform 9 (NHE9) promotes tumor progression and correlates positively with insensitivity to radiochemotherapy and poor prognosis. However, molecular mechanisms responsible for increase in NHE9 levels beyond a critical threshold have not been identified. Methods: Bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assays, real-time PCR and western blotting were conducted to examine the expression profiles and identify microRNAs (miRNA) that target NHE9. Cell proliferation and migration assays were conducted in U87 glioblastoma cells to determine the consequence of miRNA mediated targeting of NHE9. Endosomal pH measurements, immunofluorescence microscopy and surface biotinylation experiments were conducted to characterize the mechanistic basis of regulation. Results: We show that microRNA 135a (miR-135a) targets NHE9 to downregulate its expression in U87 cells. MiR-135a levels are significantly lower in glioblastoma cells compared to normal brain tissue. Downregulation of NHE9 expression by miR-135a affects proliferative and migratory capacity of U87 cells. Selectively increasing NHE9 expression in these cells restored their ability to proliferate and migrate. We demonstrate that miR-135a takes a two-pronged approach affecting epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) to suppress tumor cell growth and migration. EGFR activity is a potent stimulator of oncogenic signaling. While miR-135a targets EGFR transcripts to decrease the total number of receptors made, by targeting NHE9 it routes the few EGFRs made away from the plasma membrane to dampen oncogenic signaling. NHE9 is localized to sorting endosomes in glioblastoma cells where it alkalinizes the endosome lumen by leaking protons. Downregulation of NHE9 expression by miR-135a acidifies sorting endosomes limiting EGFR trafficking to the glioblastoma cell membrane. Conclusions: We propose downregulation of miR-135a as a potential mechanism underlying the high NHE9 expression observed in subset of glioblastomas. Future studies should explore miR-135a as a potential therapeutic for glioblastomas with NHE9 overexpression. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cancer; Endosome; Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); Glioblastoma; Glioma; microRNA; miR-124; miR-135a; Neurological disease; NHE9; pH; SLC9A9; Sodium-proton exchange",Article,Scopus

To determine whether blood concentrations reflect prostate tissue fatty acid profiles, we evaluated associations between phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles measured in plasma and prostate tissue from 20 patients who underwent prostatectomy. For each patient, three prostate tissue specimens varying in size and location were collected. Correlations were calculated between a) tissue specimens by size ( ≤ 20 mg, > 20 mg); b) individual tissue samples [Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)]; and c) plasma and mean tissue PLFA concentrations. PLFA concentrations from ≤ 20 mg and > 20 mg tissues were nearly identical. For most PLFAs, intra-individual correlations between tissue specimens were moderate to strong (linoleic acid = 0.66, eicosapentaenoic acid = 0.96), with only one ICC below 0.50 (trans-fatty acid 18:2, ICC = 0.28). Most correlations of mean tissue and plasma concentrations were moderate to strong (α-linoleic acid = 0.47, eicosapentaenoic acid = 0.93). PLFA concentrations are largely homogeneous within the prostate and can be reliably measured in small quantities of tissue.

In contrast to the synthetic systems, LDL particles are intrinsically biocompatible and biodegradable, together with reduced immunogenicity and natural capabilities to target cancerous cells and to escape from the recognition and elimination by the reticuloendothelial system. Enticed by these attributes, a number of strategies have been developed for reconstituting LDL particles, including conjugation to the apolipoprotein, insertion into the phospholipid layer, and loading into the core. Here we present a tutorial review on the development of reconstituted LDL (rLDL) particles for theranostic applications. We start with a brief introduction to LDL and LDL receptor, as well as the advantages of using rLDL particles as a natural and versatile platform for the targeted delivery of theranostic agents. After a discussion of commonly used strategies for the reconstitution of LDL, we highlight the applications of rLDL particles in the staging of disease progression, treatment of lesioned tissues, and delivery of photosensitizers for photodynamic cancer therapy.

The lung function decline across individual's lifetime is a consequence of age-related changes in lung anatomical structure and combination of various environmental factors; however, the exact molecular mechanisms contributing to this decline are not fully understood. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that changes across individual's lifetime, as well as allows for interplay between environmental and genetic factors. DNA methylation plays a crucial role in regulation of gene expression, with increasing evidence linking aberrant DNA methylation levels with a number of common human diseases. In this study, we investigated possible associations between genome-wide DNA methylation levels and lung function in 169 pairs of middle-aged monozygotic twins (86 male pairs: mean age (min-max) = 66 years (57-79); 83 female pairs: mean age (min-max) = 66 years (56-78)). The twins were collected from the Danish Twin Registry and were examined at baseline (1998-1999) and follow-up (2008-2011) visits. Using the twin design, we correlated intra-pair differences in cross-sectional and longitudinal lung function with intra-pair blood DNA methylation differences at follow-up by linear regression analyses adjusted for sex, age, BMI, smoking, and blood cell composition measured for each individual with the use of flow cytometry. Results: We identified several differentially methylated CpG sites associated with forced expiratory volume the first second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Three probes identified for level of FVC were located in GLIPR1L2 gene (lowest p value = 7.14 × 10-8), involved in innate immunity and tumour-suppressor/pro-oncogenic mechanisms. Change in FEV1 during the 11-year follow-up period was associated with blood DNA methylation level in TRIM27 gene (p value = 1.55 × 10-6), a negative regulator of CD4 T cells, and also involved in cancer development. Several enriched pathways were identified, especially for FEV1, with one being ""TGFBR"" (Benjamini-Hochbergadj p value = 0.045), the receptor for TGFβ, a growth factor involved in normal lung tissue repair through pro-fibrotic effects. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that epigenetic regulation of immunological- and cancer-related genes, as well as TGF-β-receptor-related genes, may be involved in the cross-sectional level and longitudinal change in lung function in middle-aged monozygotic twins. © 2017 The Author(s).","Blood; Cross-sectional; DNA methylation; Epidemiology; Epigenetics; EWAS; Longitudinal; Lung function; Monozygotic twins",Article,Scopus

Intravital multiphoton imaging, confocal imaging of cryosections and biochemical analysis revealed that localization and trafficking patterns, as well as levels of phosphorylation and ubiquitylation of EGFR in tumors in vivo closely resemble patterns and levels observed in the same cells treated with 20- 200 pM EGF in vitro. Consistent with the prediction of low ligand concentrations in tumors, EGFR endocytosis was kinase-dependent and blocked by inhibitors of clathrin-mediated internalization; and EGFR activity was insensitive to Cbl overexpression.

Potential human health risk of organic compounds with coal/lignite provenance includes endocrine disruption, nephrotoxicity, cancer, etc. Recent investigations proved that different organic components, i.e. hydrocarbons, phenols etc. move through/release out of the dump area as a result of alteration processes of the organic matter (OM) caused by the wash-out and/or drainage processes. The timeliness of the present study is based on the scarcity of information on organic geochemistry of dump materials from open pit coal mines and weathered lignites in particular. The limited number of studies on dumps clarifies that even for the ""short"" time span (some tens of years) in geological point of view, processes of transformation of the extractable OM are detectable. The secondary phases, a result of the OM transformations, move through and out of the dump area and could be potential contaminants for the surface/underground waters and soils in the area. Another environmental problem comes from the air-born VOCs and products of the modern chemical industry. By GC-MS in the slightly polar fractions of the chloroform extracts of dump samples a broad set of components was determined, i.e. phthalates (dominant), i-propyl palmitate, i-propyl myristate, n-hexyl benzoates, etc. These organic contaminants could be regarded more likely as anthropogenic (originating from plasticizers, industrial pollutants, etc.). Presently, it seems that the identified compounds do not represent an acute toxic risk from an environmental viewpoint. However, some compounds could raise concerns and further attention is needed to be focused on them. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Conference Paper,Scopus

Nuciferine is a primary bioactive component extracted from the lotus leaf, and it displays extensive pharmacological functions, including anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Nevertheless, the effects of nuciferine on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated ALI in mice has not been investigated. ALI of mice stimulated by LPS was used to determine the anti-inflammatory function of nuciferine. The molecular mechanism of nuciferine was performed on RAW264.7 macrophage cells. The results of pathological section, myeloperoxidase activity and lung wet/dry ratio showed that nuciferine alleviated LPS-induced lung injury (p < 0.05). qRT-PCR and ELISA experiments suggested that nuciferine inhibited TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β secretion in tissues and RAW264.7 cells but increased IL-10 secretion (p < 0.05). Molecular studies showed that TLR4 expression and nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation were both inhibited by nuciferine treatment (p < 0.05). To further investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of nuciferine, TLR4 was knocked down. When TLR4 was silenced, LPS induced the production of IL-1β, and TNF-α was markedly decreased by TLR4-siRNA and nuciferine treatment in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells (p < 0.05). These results suggested that nuciferine had the ability to protect against LPS-stimulated ALI. Thus, nuciferine may be a potential drug for treating LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation. © 2017 Wu, Yang, Guo, Yang, Jiang, Zhao, Qiu and Deng.","Acute lung injury; Anti-inflammation; Nuciferine; Nuclear factor-κB; Toll-like receptor 4",Article,Scopus

However, due to the lack of potent, selective, and pharmacologically compliant inhibitors, the wide therapeutic potential of rhomboids is currently untapped. Here, we bridge this gap by discovering that peptidyl α-ketoamides substituted at the ketoamide nitrogen by hydrophobic groups are potent rhomboid inhibitors active in the nanomolar range, surpassing the currently used rhomboid inhibitors by up to three orders of magnitude. Such peptidyl ketoamides show selectivity for rhomboids, leaving most human serine hydrolases unaffected. Crystal structures show that these compounds bind the active site of rhomboid covalently and in a substrate-like manner, and kinetic analysis reveals their reversible, slow-binding, non-competitive mechanism. Since ketoamides are clinically used pharmacophores, our findings uncover a straightforward modular way for the design of specific inhibitors of rhomboid proteases, which can be widely applicable in cell biology and drug discovery. Ticha et al. discover rhomboid protease inhibitors that are unprecedentedly potent and selective. They are based on a pharmacologically compliant chemotype and can thus serve as hitherto unavailable specific tools for cell biology or can yield lead compounds targeting rhomboids in medically relevant contexts such as malaria or Parkinson's disease. © 2017 The Authors","crystal structure; inhibition; inhibitor; intramembrane protease; ketoamide; mechanism; rhomboid protease; specificity",Article,Scopus

This complex (where factor VIIa (FVIIa) is a catalytically active part and tissue factor (TF) is its essential cofactor) activates its primary substrate factor X (FX) leading to factor Xa (FXa) (‘a’ stands for ‘activated’). Both FX and FXa are able to bind to phospholipid membrane and, therefore, are distributed between solution and membrane surface. As a result, two possible mechanisms of substrate delivery to the extrinsic tenase exist: via lateral diffusion on the membrane surface or directly from the solution. Determination of the predominant pathway of substrate delivery is an important key to understanding the precise reaction mechanism. Here we construct a mechanism-driven computational model of FX activation by extrinsic tenase on the surface of phospholipid vesicles of different size. We show that experimentally observed dependence of the tenase activity on the phospholipid concentration could be obtained only if the substrate (FX) is membrane-bound. For correct experimental data description it is also necessary to take into account the dependence of FX/FXa membrane binding parameters (equilibrium dissociation constant and the number of phospholipid molecules per bound FX/FXa) on the membrane curvature. The model predicts that small vesicles promote activation of FX by the extrinsic tenase significantly better than large vesicles (with the same overall phospholipid, factors VIIa, X and TF concentrations in the solution). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Blood coagulation; Computational modeling; Extrinsic pathway; Phospholipid vesicles; Tissue factor",Article,Scopus

Recently, Mitomycin C was reported to improve the outcome of patients by reducing the number of endoscopic dilatations. However, other groups failed to exhibit a beneficial effect. We report on our experience with topic Mitomycin C application following endoscopic dilatation for recurrent ES. Methods Retrospective chart review of patients with ES treated at the Hannover Medical School (Location A) and the University of Leipzig (Location B) between 2009 and 2015. A Mitomycin C-soaked cotton swab was endoscopically placed at the area of stricture in all subjects. Successful treatment was defined as resolution of stricture after Mitomycin C therapy with not more than three dilatations thereafter. Our results were compared with published outcomes of alternative studies that involved 10 or more patients. Results A total of 11 children received Mitomycin C concurrently with endoscopic dilatations. Seven children (64%) had gross type C esophageal atresia, two patients (18%) gross type A esophageal atresia, and two children (18%) caustic injury. After a median follow-up of 34 months (range, 14-75 months) and a median number of 3 ± 2.5 dilatations with Mitomycin C application per patient (range, 1-9), 6 of 11 patients (55%) achieved a resolution of their strictures. Five patients (45%) did not respond to Mitomycin C therapy, of which two needed esophageal redo-surgery. Conclusion We failed to confirm the high success rates of Mitomycin C treatment for recurrent ESs. Given the fact that there is limited data to prove the beneficial effect of Mitomycin C treatment, pediatric surgeons should carefully consider whether the advantages of this therapy outweigh the necessity of life-long endoscopic follow-ups.

Use of Toombak has been etiologically linked to various oral diseases including oral cancer. This study aimed to obtain baseline information about the Toombak use among Sudanese school workers, as well as their knowledge about Toombak related health hazards and attitude towards their role in Toombak control. In addition, this study assessed the availability and effectiveness of control policies and preventive practices in the schools. Methods: A cross-sectional school-based study using one-stage stratified random sampling procedure; four schools were selected randomly from each of seven localities. A total of 239 school workers' were recruited (census) from the selected schools in Khartoum State, Sudan. Results: Of the school workers, 63% (147) were ≤40 years, half were females and 79.2% (187) were teachers. A total of 9.6% (22) school workers confirmed ever use of Toombak and the percentage of daily users amounted to 64.7% (11). Moreover, 76.2% (16) of ever Toombak users were ≥40 years and all of them were males (p < 0.001). Most of the school workers reported good knowledge, positive attitude towards their role in Toombak control and good preventive practice. Female school workers were more likely to report positive attitude towards their role in Toombak control (p < 05), and to report good knowledge. Those reporting good preventive practice in schools reported good knowledge more than two times than their counterpart (p < 0.001). Age was the strongest predictor of ever Toombak use among school workers (p < .001). Conclusions: The use of Toombak among school workers was associated with poor knowledge, negative attitude towards their role in Toombak control and poor preventive practice, Therefore, school workers use of Toombak may reduce their motivation and use of their potential in the prevention of a major health problem caused by Toombak use and affects their role model behaviour. On the other hand, school workers engagement with preventive practices in schools' was associated with good knowledge which in turn empowers their positive attitude towards their role in Toombak control. © 2017 The Author(s).","Attitude; Knowledge; School workers; Smokeless tobacco SLT; Sudan; Toombak",Article,Scopus

Here, we utilize disulfide tethering of a non-natural cysteine (K-Ras(M72C)) to identify a new switch-II pocket (S-IIP) binding ligand (2C07) that engages the active GTP state. Co-crystal structures of 2C07 bound to H-Ras(M72C) reveal binding in a cryptic groove we term S-IIG. In the GppNHp state, 2C07 binding to a modified S-IIP pushes switch I away from the nucleotide, breaking the network of polar contacts essential for adopting the canonical GTP state. Biochemical studies show that 2C07 alters nucleotide preference and inhibits SOS binding and catalyzed nucleotide exchange. 2C07 was converted to irreversible covalent analogs, which target both nucleotide states, inhibit PI3K activation in vitro, and function as occupancy probes to detect reversible engagement in competition assays. Targeting both nucleotide states opens the possibility of inhibiting oncogenic mutants of Ras, which exist predominantly in the GTP state in cells. Small-molecule Ras inhibitors offer a promising avenue to address the 20% of cancers driven by this oncogene.

These patients, classified as prednisone poor responders (PPR), have poorer outcome than do the other pediatric T-ALL patients receiving a highrisk adapted therapy. Because glucocorticoids are administered to ALL patients during all the different phases of therapy, GC resistance represents an important challenge to improving the outcome for these patients. Mechanisms underlying resistance are not yet fully unraveled; thus our research focused on the identification of deregulated signaling pathways to point out new targeted approaches. We first identified, by reverse-phase protein arrays, the lymphocyte cell-specific protein-Tyrosine kinase (LCK) as aberrantly activated in PPR patients. We showed that LCK inhibitors, such as dasatinib, bosutinib, nintedanib, and WH-4-023, are able to induce cell death in GC-resistant T-ALL cells, and remarkably, cotreatment with dexamethasone is able to reverse GC resistance, even at therapeutic drug concentrations. This was confirmed by specificLCKgene silencing and ex vivo combined treatment of cells fromPPRpatient-derived xenografts. Moreover, we observed that LCK hyperactivation in PPR patients upregulates the calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells signaling triggering to interleukin-4 (IL-4) overexpression. GC-sensitive cells cultured with IL-4 display an increased resistance to dexamethasone, whereas the inhibition of IL-4 signaling could increase GC-induced apoptosis in resistant cells. Treatment with dexamethasone and dasatinib also impaired engraftment of leukemia cells in vivo. Our results suggest a quickly actionable approach to supporting conventional therapies and overcoming GC resistance in pediatric T-ALL patients. © 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.",,Article,Scopus

Among UHRF1 partners, TIP60 takes part in epigenetic regulations through its acetyltransferase activity. Both proteins are involved in multiple cellular functions such as chromatin remodeling, DNA damage repair and regulation of stability and activity of other proteins. The aim of this work was to investigate the interaction between UHRF1 and TIP60 in order to elucidate the dialogue between these two proteins. Methods: Biochemical (immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays) and microscopic (confocal and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy; FLIM) techniques were used to analyze the interaction between TIP60 and UHRF1 in vitro and in vivo. Global methylation levels were assessed by using a specific kit. The results were statistically analyzed using Graphpad prism and Origin. Results: Our study shows that UHRF1, TIP60 and DNMT1 were found in the same epigenetic macro-molecular complex. In vitro pull-down assay showed that deletion of either the zinc finger in MYST domain or deletion of whole MYST domain from TIP60 significantly reduced its interaction with UHRF1. Confocal and FLIM microscopy showed that UHRF1 co-localized with TIP60 in the nucleus and confirmed that both proteins interacted together through the MYST domain of TIP60. Moreover, overexpression of TIP60 reduced the DNA methylation levels in HeLa cells along with downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate for the first time that TIP60 through its MYST domain directly interacts with UHRF1 which might be of high interest for the development of novel oncogenic inhibitors targeting this interaction. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cancer; Cell cycle; Epigenetics; Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM); Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET); Protein-protein interaction; TIP60; UHRF1",Article,Scopus

Herein, we focused on LEFTY expression and its association with progesterone therapy in Em Cas. Methods: Regulation and function of LEFTY, as well as its associated molecules including Smad2, ovarian hormone receptors, GSK-3β, and cell cycle-related factors, were assessed using clinical samples and cell lines of Em Cas. Results: In clinical samples, LEFTY expression was positively correlated with estrogen receptor-α, but not progesterone receptor (PR), status, and was inversely related to phosphorylated (p) Smad2, cyclin A2, and Ki-67 levels. During progesterone therapy, expression of LEFTY, pSmad2, and pGSK-3β showed stepwise increases, with significant correlations to morphological changes toward secretory features and decreased Ki-67 values. In Ishikawa cells, an Em Ca cell line that expresses PR, progesterone treatment reduced proliferation and induced increased expression of LEFTY and pGSK-3β, although LEFTY promoter regions were inhibited by transfection of PR. Moreover, inhibition of GSK-3β resulted in increased LEFTY expression through a decrease in its ubiquitinated form, suggesting posttranslational regulation of LEFTY protein via GSK-3β suppression in response to progesterone. In addition, overexpression or knockdown of LEFTY led to suppression or enhancement of Smad2-dependent cyclin A2 expression, respectively. Conclusion: Upregulation of LEFTY may serve as a useful clinical marker for the therapeutic effects of progesterone for Em Cas, leading to inhibition of tumor cell proliferation through alteration in Smad2-dependent transcription of cyclin A2. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cyclin a; Endometrial carcinoma; Lefty; Progesterone therapy; Smad; TGF-β",Article,Scopus

Methods: This is a retrospective, registry-based study using data from the national registry of targeted therapies for mRCC. The RENIS registry contains data on 3049 patients who started the therapy with at least one targeted agent before 31 December, 2014. Of these patients, 1029 had a record of at least two different targeted therapies and sufficient data for analysis. Survival analysis was carried out using the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical significance of differences in survival between subgroups was assessed using the log-rank test. Results: The median overall survival from the start of second-line treatment was 17.0months (95% confidence interval [CI] 14.5-19.5months), 17.1months (95% CI 14.5-19.8), and 15.4months (95% CI 11.0-19.7) for second-line everolimus, sorafenib, and sunitinib, respectively.

However, the influence of lead oxide nanoparticles, frequently emitted to the environment by high temperature technological processes, is still concealed. Therefore, we investigate lead oxide nanoparticle distribution through the body upon their entry into lungs and determine the microscopic and ultramicroscopic changes caused by the nanoparticles in primary and secondary target organs. Methods: Adult female mice (ICR strain) were continuously exposed to lead oxide nanoparticles (PbO-NPs) with an average concentration approximately 106 particles/cm3 for 6 weeks (24 h/day, 7 days/week). At the end of the exposure period, lung, brain, liver, kidney, spleen, and blood were collected for chemical, histological, immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analyses. Results: Lead content was found to be the highest in the kidney and lungs, followed by the liver and spleen; the smallest content of lead was found in brain. Nanoparticles were located in all analysed tissues and their highest number was found in the lung and liver. Kidney, spleen and brain contained lower number of nanoparticles, being about the same in all three organs. Lungs of animals exposed to lead oxide nanoparticles exhibited hyperaemia, small areas of atelectasis, alveolar emphysema, focal acute catarrhal bronchiolitis and also haemostasis with presence of siderophages in some animals. Nanoparticles were located in phagosomes or formed clusters within cytoplasmic vesicles. In the liver, lead oxide nanoparticle exposure caused hepatic remodeling with enlargement and hydropic degeneration of hepatocytes, centrilobular hypertrophy of hepatocytes with karyomegaly, areas of hepatic necrosis, occasional periportal inflammation, and extensive accumulation of lipid droplets. Nanoparticles were accumulated within mitochondria and peroxisomes forming aggregates enveloped by an electron-dense mitochondrial matrix. Only in some kidney samples, we observed areas of inflammatory infiltrates around renal corpuscles, tubules or vessels in the cortex. Lead oxide nanoparticles were dispersed in the cytoplasm, but not within cell organelles. There were no significant morphological changes in the spleen as a secondary target organ. Thus, pathological changes correlated with the amount of nanoparticles found in cells rather than with the concentration of lead in a given organ. Conclusions: Sub-chronic exposure to lead oxide nanoparticles has profound negative effects at both cellular and tissue levels. Notably, the fate and arrangement of lead oxide nanoparticles were dependent on the type of organs. © 2017 The Author(s).","Brain; Electron microscopy; Inhalation; Kidney; Lead oxide; Liver; Lung; Nanoparticles; Spleen; Toxicity",Article,Scopus

Therefore, we compared all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality for elderly patients with breast cancer with and without mental illness. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted by using SEER-Medicare data, including 19,028 women ≥ 68 years of age who were diagnosed with stage I to IIIa breast cancer in the United States from 2005 to 2007. Patients were classified as having severe mental illness if an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification code for bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorder was recorded on at least one inpatient or two outpatient claims during the 3 years before breast cancer diagnosis. Patients were followed for up to 5 years after breast cancer diagnosis to assess survival outcomes, which were then compared with those of patients without mental illness. Results: Nearly 3% of patients had preexisting severe mental illness. We observed a two-fold increase in the all-cause mortality hazard between patients with severe mental illness compared with those without mental illness after adjusting for age, income, race, ethnicity, geographic location, and marital status (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.84 to 2.60). A 20% increase in breast cancer-specific mortality hazard was observed, but the association was not significant (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.74). Patients with severe mental illness were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced breast cancer and aggressive tumor characteristics. They also had increased tobacco use and more comorbidities. Conclusion: Patients with severe mental illness may need assistance with coordinating medical services. © 2017 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,Article,Scopus

The inaugural two-day meeting was held at the Royal Society of Medicine (RSM), London, UK, 5-6 September 2017. Microbiome and cancer experts from around the world first delivered a series of talks during an educational day and then sat for a day of roundtable discussion to debate key topics in microbiome-cancer research. Talks delivered during the educational day covered a broad range of microbiome-related topics. The potential role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer was discussed and debated in detail with experts highlighting the latest data in animal models and humans and addressing the question of causation versus association. The impact of the microbiota on other cancers-such as lung and urogenital tract-was also discussed. The microbiome represents a novel target for therapeutic manipulation in cancer and a number of talks explored how this might be realised through diet, faecal microbiota transplant and chemotherapeutics. On the second day, experts debated pre-agreed topics with the aim of producing a consensus statement with a focus on the current state of our knowledge and key gaps for further development. The panel debated the notion of a 'healthy' microbiome and, in turn, the concept of dysbiosis in cancer. The mechanisms of microbiota-induced carcinogenesis were discussed in detail and our current conceptual models were assessed. Experts also considered co-factors in microbiome-induced carcinogenesis to conclude that the tripartite 'interactome' between genetically vulnerable host, environment and the microbiome is central to our current understanding. To conclude, the roundtable discussed how the microbiome may be exploited for therapeutic benefit in cancer and the safety implications of performing such research in oncology patients. © the authors.","Cancer; Consortium; Gut; Microbiome; Microbiota",Conference Paper,Scopus

Although the majority were non-Hispanic white, well educated, and economically well off, substantial numbers of harder-to-recruit women also enrolled (race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic white: 16%; no college degree: 35%; household income <$50,000: 26%). Although all had a biologic sister with breast cancer, 16.5% had average or lower risk of breast cancer according to the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (Gail score). Most were postmenopausal (66%), parous with a first full-term pregnancy <30y of age (79%), never-smokers (56%) with body mass indexes (BMIs) of <29.9 kg/m2 (70%).

In mammalians, 14-3-3 proteins have seven distinct isoforms (β, γ, ϵ, η, ζ, σ and τ/θ) which are involved in various cellular processes including signal transduction, cell cycle, cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and survival. 14-3-3 proteins do not have a distinct catalytic activity and often regulate the activity, stability, subcellular localization and interactions of other proteins. The 14-3-3 family proteins function through interacting with their client proteins or facilitating the interaction of other proteins likely as adaptor proteins. The versatile functions of these proteins in the regulation of cell growth, cell division, cell death and cell migration make them candidate proteins for which an important role in cancer development could be envisioned. Indeed, analysis of cancer cell lines and tumor-derived tissues have indicated the differential abundance or post-translational modification of some 14-3-3 isoforms. In this review, we aimed to show how deregulation of 14-3-3 proteins contributes to initiation, establishment and progression of cancers with a particular emphasis on lung cancer.

Numerous PDX models have been established to date, however their thorough characterization regarding the tumor formation and rates of tumor growth in the established models remains a challenging task. Our study aimed to provide more detailed information for establishing the PDX models successfully and effectively. Methods: We transplanted four different types of solid tumors from 108 Chinese patients, including 21 glioblastoma (GBM), 11 lung cancers (LC), 54 gastric cancers (GC) and 21 colorectal cancers (CRC), and took tumor tissues passaged for three successive generations. Here we report the rate of tumor formation, tumor-forming times, tumor growth curves and mortality of mice in PDX model. We also report H&E staining and immunohistochemistry for HLA-A, CD45, Ki67, GFAP, and CEA protein expression between patient cancer tissues and PDX models. Results: Tumor formation rate increasedsignificantly in subsequent tumor generations. Also, the survival rates of GC and CRC were remarkably higher than GBM and LC. As for the time required for the formation of tumors, which reflects the tumor growth rate, indicated that tumor growth rate always increased as the generation number increased. The tumor growth curves also illustrate this law. Similarly, the survival rate of PDX mice gradually improved with the increased generation number in GC and CRC. And generally, there was more proliferation (Ki67+) in the PDX models than in the patient tumors, which was in accordance with the results of tumor growth rate. The histological findings confirm similar histological architecture and degrees of differentiation between patient cancer tissues and PDX models with statistical analysis by GraphPad Prism 5.0. Conclusion: We established four different types of PDX models successfully, and our results add to the current understanding of the establishment of PDX models and may contribute to the extension of application of different types of PDX models. © 2017 The Author(s).","Colorectal cancer (CRC); Gastric cancer (GC); Glioblastoma (GBM); Lung cancer (LC); Patient derived xenograft (PDX)",Article,Scopus

Recent studies have provided mechanistic details of the roles of sphingolipids and their downstream targets in the regulation of tumour growth and response to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and/or immunotherapy using innovative molecular, genetic and pharmacological tools to target sphingolipid signalling nodes in cancer cells. For example, structure-function-based studies have provided innovative opportunities to develop mechanism-based anticancer therapeutic strategies to restore anti-proliferative ceramide signalling and/or inhibit pro-survival S1P-S1P receptor (S1PR) signalling. This Review summarizes how ceramide-induced cellular stress mediates cancer cell death through various mechanisms involving the induction of apoptosis, necroptosis and/or mitophagy. Moreover, the metabolism of ceramide for S1P biosynthesis, which is mediated by sphingosine kinase 1 and 2, and its role in influencing cancer cell growth, drug resistance and tumour metastasis through S1PR-dependent or receptor-independent signalling are highlighted.

Luminal A was observed in 380 cases (49.4%), luminal B in 224 (29.1%), HER-2 type in 68 (8.8%), and TNBC in 98 (12.7%). Stromal AOC3, MAO-A, and MAO-B expression varied according to molecular subtypes. Stromal AOC3 expression was high in luminal B and HER-2 type and MAO-A expression was high in luminal A and luminal B (p < 0.001). MAO-B expression was higher in TNBC than in other subtypes (p = 0.020). LOX positivity was associated with high histological grade (p < 0.001) and high Ki-67 labeling index (LI) (p = 0.009), and stromal AOC3 positivity was associated with high histological grade (p = 0.001), high Ki-67 LI (p < 0.001), and HER-2 positivity (p = 0.002). MAO-A positivity was related to low histological grade (p < 0.001), ER positivity, PR positivity (p < 0.001), and low Ki-67 LI (p < 0.001). In univariate analysis, MAO-A positivity was related to short disease-free survival in HER-2 type (p = 0.013), AOC3 negativity was related to short disease-free survival and overall survival in ER-positive breast cancer, PR-positive breast cancer, HER-2-negative breast cancer, and lymph node metastasis.

Reprogramming metabolic pathways and nutrient sensing is an elaborate way by which cancer cells respond to high bioenergetic and anabolic demands during tumorigenesis. Thus, inhibiting specific metabolic pathways at defined steps should provide potent ways of arresting tumor growth. However, both animal models and clinical observations have revealed that this approach is seriously limited by an extraordinary cellular metabolic plasticity. The classical example of cancer metabolic reprogramming is the preference for aerobic glycolysis, or Warburg effect, where cancers increase their glycolytic flux and produce lactate regardless of the presence of the oxygen. This allows cancer cells to meet the metabolic requirements for high rates of proliferation. Here, we discuss the benefits and limitations of disrupting fermentative glycolysis for impeding tumor growth at three levels of the pathway: (i) an upstream block at the level of the glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), (ii) a downstream block at the level of lactate dehydrogenases (LDH, isoforms A and B), and (iii) the endpoint block preventing lactic acid export (MCT1/4). Using these examples of genetic disruption targeting glycolysis studied in our lab, we will discuss the responses of different cancer cell lines in terms of metabolic rewiring, growth arrest, and tumor escape and compare it with the broader literature. © 2017 Ždralevic, Marchiq, de Padua, Parks and Pouysségur.","Cancer; CRISPR-Cas9; Glycolysis; Immune response; Lactic acid; Metabolism; Oxidative phosphorylation; Pentose phosphate pathway",Short Survey,Scopus

A prominent example is hypomethylation of the aryl hydrocarbon-receptor repressor (AHRR) locus, which is observed in blood and squamous epithelial cells of smokers, but not in lung cancer. Results: Using a novel systems-epigenomics algorithm, called SEPIRA, which leverages the power of a large RNA-sequencing expression compendium to infer regulatory activity from messenger RNA expression or DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles, we infer the landscape of binding activity of lung-specific transcription factors (TFs) in lung carcinogenesis. We show that lung-specific TFs become preferentially inactivated in lung cancer and precursor lung cancer lesions and further demonstrate that these results can be derived using only DNAm data. We identify subsets of TFs which become inactivated in precursor cells. Among these regulatory factors, we identify AHR, the aryl hydrocarbon-receptor which controls a healthy immune response in the lung epithelium and whose repressor, AHRR, has recently been implicated in smoking-mediated lung cancer. In addition, we identify FOXJ1, a TF which promotes growth of airway cilia and effective clearance of the lung airway epithelium from carcinogens. Conclusions: We identify TFs, such as AHR, which become inactivated in the earliest stages of lung cancer and which, unlike AHRR hypomethylation, are also inactivated in lung cancer itself. The novel systems-epigenomics algorithm SEPIRA will be useful to the wider epigenome-wide association study community as a means of inferring regulatory activity. © 2017 The Author(s).","AHRR; Cancer; Causality; DNA methylation; EWAS; Gene expression; Regulatory network; Smoking; Transcription factor",Article,Scopus

Field cancerization is the consequence of the evolution of somatic cells in the body that results in cells that carry some but not all phenotypes required for malignancy.

Acetylation of histone H3K18, associated with gene activation, is enhanced by P300 and opposed by the deacetylase Sirtuin2 (SIRT2). As these enzymes represent an important target for cancer therapy, we sought to determine whether the underlying genes are altered during prostate cancer (PCa) progression. Methods: Tissue microarrays generated from 71 radical prostatectomy patients were initially immunostained for H3K18Ac, P300 and SIRT2. Protein levels were quantified using VECTRA automation and correlated with clinicopathologic parameters. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TGCA, n = 499) and Gene Expression Omnibus (n = 504) databases were queried for expression, genomic and clinical data. Statistics were performed using SPSSv23. Results: Nuclear histone H3K18Ac staining increases in primary cancer (p = 0.05) and further in metastases (p < 0.01) compared to benign on tissue arrays. P300 protein expression increases in cancer (p = 0.04) and metastases (p < 0.001). A progressive decrease in nuclear SIRT2 staining occurs comparing benign to cancer or metastases (p = 0.04 and p = 0.03 respectively). Decreased SIRT2 correlates with higher grade cancer (p = 0.02). Time to Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) recurrence is shorter in patients exhibiting high compared to low H3K18Ac expression (350 vs. 1542 days respectively, P = 0.03). In GEO, SIRT2 mRNA levels are lower in primary and metastatic tumors (p = 0.01 and 0.001, respectively). TGCA analysis demonstrates SIRT2 deletion in 6% and increasing clinical stage, positive margins and lower PSA recurrence-free survival in patients with SIRT2 loss/deletion (p = 0.01, 0.04 and 0.04 respectively). In this dataset, a correlation between decreasing SIRT2 and increasing P300 mRNA expression occurs in tumor samples (R = -0.46). Conclusions: In multiple datasets, decreases in SIRT2 expression portend worse clinicopathologic outcomes. Alterations in SIRT2-H3K18Ac suggest altered P300 activity and identify a subset of tumors that could benefit from histone deacetylation inhibition. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cancer progression; Epigenetic modifications in PCa; Histone H3 acetylation; SIRT2 loss",Article,Scopus

Methods: The differences of common clinicopathologic factors, inflammatory indexes including PLR (Platelet lymphocyte ratio) between LCC and RCC were analyzed in the training cohort with logistic regression model, subsequently, confirmed in validation cohort. Kaplan-Meier analysis was applied for the analysis of the survival difference distinguished by the PLR and the Nonparametric Test was adopted to demonstrate the difference of PLR variation with the standard TNM classification between RCC and LCC. Results: A total of 1846 CRC patients entered the study, 744 (40.3%) patients were RCC, 1102 (59.7%) were LCC. The patients' number in both cohorts was 923. It was found that LCC patients in the training cohort significantly to be with higher CEA, adenocarcinoma, early UICC/AJCC stage, p-MMR (mismatch-repair proficient), and lower PLR, and the later four features were confirm in validation cohort. Higher PLR, the unique inflammatory index, was significantly associated with poorer OS in LCC cohort (P = 0.002) and was elevated with the TNM stage in the LCC patients (P < 0.001), however, the two relationships did not sustain in RCC patients. Conclusion: Expect the classical characteristics, PLR, an inexpensive and easily assessable inflammatory index was found first time to be significant differ between LCC and RCC.

Parents express concerns about the impact of cancer on their children and report a lack of professional guidance in meeting their children's needs. Few parenting interventions exist and current interventions have extensive infrastructure demands making them unsuitable for routine use in most health settings. The aims of this study are to develop and establish the feasibility and acceptability of a novel and accessible psycho-educational intervention to improve parenting efficacy and decrease parental stress among adults with cancer who have children aged 3-12 years. The intervention will be suitable for parents with cancer who are receiving treatment with a view to longer term survival, irrespective of cancer diagnosis, and their respective co-parents. Methods/design: This study comprises two phases using the UK Medical Research Council framework for developing complex interventions. In the development phase, intervention content will be iteratively developed and evaluated in consultation with consumers, and in the piloting phase, feasibility will be tested in a clinical sample of 20 parents with cancer and their co-parents using a single arm, pre-test post-test design. The intervention will comprise an audiovisual resource (DVD), a question prompt list, and a telephone call with a clinical psychologist. Questionnaires administered pre- and 1 month post-intervention will assess parental stress, psychological morbidity, quality of life, self-efficacy and perceptions of child adjustment, and family functioning. Intervention feasibility will be determined by mixed-method participant evaluation of perceived usefulness, benefits, and acceptability. Discussion: This new initiative will translate existing descriptive evidence into an accessible intervention that supports parenting during cancer treatment and meets the information needs of parents with cancer and their families. This is an important advance: despite increasing recognition of the impact of parental cancer on the family, intervention research lags behind the descriptive literature. This low-intensity, accessible, and targeted intervention places minimal burden on infrastructure and promotes patient autonomy and self-management. If feasible, this style of intervention may be a template for future interventions with similar populations. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cancer; Intervention; Oncology; Parenting; Psycho-education",Article,Scopus

Methods: The RDW and PDW values of 227 patients with GC and 164 patients with early GC were retrospectively analyzed comparing with 101 healthy controls. In addition, the clinicopathological features, survival curves and prognosis of the patients with GC were compared between the high and low groups according to the RDW and PDW values. Results: Significant higher RDW and lower PDW were detected in patients with GC and early GC compared to the healthy controls. A higher RDW was significantly associated with older age, a larger tumor diameter, deeper tumor infiltration, and lymph node metastasis while a lower PDW was significantly associated with male, older age, a larger tumor diameter, deeper tumor infiltration, elevated CEA and CA125. Increased RDW was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for GC (P = 0.042 and P = 0.033, respectively) and early GC (P = 0.037 and P = 0.009, respectively) while decreased PDW indicated a significantly association with poor DFS for early GC (P = 0.006). Univariate and multivariate survival analysis showed that RDW and PDW can act as independent prognostic factors for DFS (P = 0.028 and P = 0.020) in patients with early GC.

This study evaluated the impact of a theoretically/empirically based intervention (ConquerFear) on FCR. Methods: Eligible survivors had curable breast or colorectal cancer or melanoma, had completed treatment (not including endocrine therapy) 2 months to 5 years previously, were age > 18 years, and had scores above the clinical cutoff on the FCR Inventory (FCRI) severity subscale at screening. Participants were randomly assigned at a one-to-one ratio to either five face-to-face sessions of ConquerFear (attention training, metacognitions, acceptance/mindfulness, screening behavior, and values-based goal setting) or an attention control (Taking-it-Easy relaxation therapy). Participants completed questionnaires at baseline (T0), immediately post-therapy (T1), and 3 (T2) and 6 months (T3) later. The primary outcome was FCRI total score. Results: Of 704 potentially eligible survivors from 17 sites and two online databases, 533 were contactable, of whom 222 (42%) consented; 121 were randomly assigned to intervention and 101 to control.

It is known that stress signals modulate multiple processes such as immune function, cell migration and angiogenesis. However, few studies have investigated the mechanisms of how stress signals contribute to gastric cancer angiogenesis. Methods: Here, we used β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) agonist isoprenaline to imitate a stress signal and demonstrated the molecular mechanism underlying stress's influence on tumor angiogenesis. Results: We found that isoprenaline stimulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion in gastric cancer cells and plexin-A1 expression was induced by human recombinant VEGF165 in both gastric cancer cells and vascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, interfere with plexin-A1 expression in gastric cancer cells influence HUVEC tube formation, migration and tumor growth in vivo. Conclusions: These findings suggest that isoprenaline stimulate VGEF secretion and subsequently up-regulate the expression of plexin-A1 and VEGFR2 in gastric cancer cells, which form a positive impetus to promote tumor angiogenesis. This study reveals a novel molecular mechanism that a stress signal like isoprenaline may enhance angiogenesis via activating plexin-A1/VEGFR2 signaling pathway in gastric cancer, which may be a potential target in development of an anti-angiogenic therapy for gastric cancer. © 2017 The Author(s).","Angiogenesis; Gastric cancer; Isoprenaline; Plexin-A1; VEGFR2",Article,Scopus

Methods: A genome-wide methylation was analyzed in 42 surgically resected tumor tissues, 136 bronchial washing, 12 sputum, and 8 bronchial biopsy specimens using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, and models for prediction of lung cancer were evaluated using TCGA lung cancer data. Results: Four thousand seven hundred and twenty-six CpGs (P<1.0E-07) that were highly methylated in tumor tissues were identified from 42 lung cancer patients. Ten CpGs were selected for prediction of lung cancer. Genes including the 10 CpGs were classified into three categories: (i) transcription (HOXA9, SOX17, ZNF154, HOXD13); (ii) cell signaling (HBP1, SFRP1, VIPR2); and (iii) adhesion (PCDH17, ITGA5, CD34). Three logistic regression models based on the 10 CpGs classified 897 TCGA primary lung tissues with a sensitivity of 95.0~97.8% and a specificity of 97.4~98.7%. However, the classification performance of the models was very poor in bronchial washing samples: the area under the curve (AUC) was equal to 0.72~0.78. The methylation levels of the 10 CpGs in bronchial biopsy were not significantly different from those in surgically resected tumor tissues (P>0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). However, their methylation levels were significantly different between paired bronchial biopsy and washing (P<0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Conclusions: The present study suggests that bronchial biopsy specimen may be used as a surrogate for DNA methylation analysis in patient with inoperable lung cancer. © 2017 The Author(s).","Bronchial biopsy; Hypermethylation; Inoperable; Lung cancer; Surrogate",Article,Scopus

The major mechanism of ARTN action is via binding to a non-signaling co-receptor. The major function of ARTN is to drive the molecule to induce migration and axonal projection from sympathetic neurons. It also promotes the survival, proliferation and neurite outgrowth of sympathetic neurons in vitro. ARTN triggers oncogenicity and metastasis by the activation of the AKT signaling pathway. Recent studies have reported that the expression of ARTN in hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with increased tumor size, quick relapse and shorter survival. Furthermore, ARTN promotes drug resistance such as antiestrogens, doxorubicin, fulvestrant, paclitaxel, tamoxifen and trastuzumab. Moreover, ARTN also stimulates the radio-therapeutic resistance. This review highlights the proposed roles of ARTN in cancer cells and discusses recent results supporting its emerging role as an oncogenic, metastatic and drug-resisting agent with a special focus on how these new insights may facilitate rational development of ARTN for targeted therapies in the future. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","ARTN; cell survival; drug resistance; metastasis; oncogenicity",Article,Scopus

Indeed, aptamers can be easily equipped with a wide variety of reporter groups or coupled to different carriers, nanoparticles, or other biomolecules, thus producing valuable molecular recognition tools effective for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. This review reports an updated overview on fluorescent DNA aptamers, designed to recognize significant cancer biomarkers both in soluble or membrane-bound form. In many examples, the aptamer secondary structure switches induced by target recognition are suitably translated in a detectable fluorescent signal using either fluorescently-labelled or label-free aptamers. The fluorescence emission changes, producing an enhancement (“signal-on”) or a quenching (“signal-off”) effect, directly reflect the extent of the binding, thereby allowing for quantitative determination of the target in bioanalytical assays. Furthermore, several aptamers conjugated to fluorescent probes proved to be effective for applications in tumour diagnosis and intraoperative surgery, producing tumour-type specific, non-invasive in vivo imaging tools for cancer pre- and post-treatment assessment. © 2017 by the authors.

The biological bases of these activities are grounded in profound alterations of the metabolism and the structural organization of the cells, which consequently acquire the ability to modify the surrounding microenvironment, by altering the extracellular matrix and affecting the properties of the other cells present in the brain, such as normal glial-, endothelial- and immune-cells. Most of the effects on the surrounding environment are probably exerted through the release of a variety of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which contain many different classes of molecules, from genetic material to defined species of lipids and enzymes. EV-associated molecules can be either released into the extracellular matrix (ECM) and/or transferred to neighboring cells: as a consequence, both deep modifications of the recipient cell phenotype and digestion of ECM components are obtained, thus causing cancer propagation, as well as a general brain dysfunction. In this review, we first analyze the main intracellular and extracellular transformations required for glioma cell invasion into the brain parenchyma; then we discuss how these events may be attributed, at least in part, to EVs that, like the pawns of a dramatic chess game with cancer, open the way to the tumor cells themselves. © 2017 by the authors.

Molecular and cellular studies showed that codrug UA-Met significantly inhibited the invasion (~55.3 ± 2.74%) and migration (~52.4 ± 1.57%) of TGF-β induced breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells in vitro at low concentration of 10 μM. These effects were accompanied by down-regulation of CXCR4, uPA, vimentin, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and MMP-2/9 proteins expression and regulation of the AMPK/m-TOR signaling pathways as expected from UA and Met. Moreover, UA-Met could reduce the progression of pulmonary metastasis by 4T1 cells (63.4 ± 3.52%) without influencing the glucose blood level in mice. Our study suggests that the codrug UA-Met is safe and effective in preventing cancer metastasis and possibly treatment of cancer. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","breast cancer; metastasis; metformin; TGF-β; ursolic acid",Article,Scopus

We performed a systemic review of current progress and controversies regarding the diagnosis and treatment of PCa. Data Sources: We searched PubMed for recently published articles up to July 2017 using the following key words: ""prostate cancer,"" ""progress,"" ""controversy,"" ""immunotherapy,"" and ""prevention."" Study Selection: Articles were obtained and reviewed to provide a systematic review of the current progress and controversies regarding PCa management. Results: The value of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening remains controversial, but PSA screening is recommended to facilitate the early diagnosis of PCa in high-risk groups. Prostate biopsy via the transrectal or perineal approach has both advantages and disadvantages. There was a significant correlation between testosterone levels and PCa prognosis. The current research is focused on the mechanisms responsible for PCa. Active surveillance has been proposed as a management strategy for low-risk, localized PCa, but there is an urgent need for further clinical studies to establish the criteria for recommending this approach. The main complications of radical resection for PCa are urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction, though three-dimensional laparoscopic and robot-assisted laparoscopic techniques have obvious advantages over radical surgery. Radiotherapy is also a therapeutic option for PCa, while immunotherapies may alter the prostate tumor microenvironment. Ongoing studies aim to provide guidance on effective sequential and combination strategies. Prevention remains an important strategy for reducing PCa morbidity and mortality. Conclusions: The diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of PCa are complex issues, worthy of intensive study. Further studies are needed to improve the management of PCa. © 2017 Chinese Medical Journal.","Active surveillance; Advance; Immunotherapy; Prevention; Prostate cancer",Review,Scopus

These include Ras proteins, prevalently mutated in pancreatic cancer. In our study, we evaluated the effect of three key intermediates of the mevalonate pathway on GFP-K-Ras protein localization and the gene expression profile in pancreatic cancer cells after exposure to individual statins. Methods: These effects were tested on MiaPaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cells carrying a K-Ras activating mutation (G12C) after exposure to individual statins (20 μM). The effect of statins (atorvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, cerivastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin) and mevalonate intermediates on GFP-K-Ras protein translocation was analyzed using fluorescence microscopy. The changes in gene expression induced in MiaPaCa-2 cells treated with simvastatin, FPP, GGPP, and their combinations with simvastatin were examined by whole genome DNA microarray analysis. Results: All tested statins efficiently inhibited K-Ras protein trafficking from cytoplasm to the cell membrane of the MiaPaCa-2 cells. The inhibitory effect of statins on GFP-K-Ras protein trafficking was partially prevented by addition of any of the mevalonate pathway's intermediates tested. Expressions of genes involved in metabolic and signaling pathways modulated by simvastatin treatment was normalized by the concurrent addition of FPP or GGPP. K-Ras protein trafficking within the pancreatic cancer cells is effectively inhibited by the majority of statins; the inhibition is eliminated by isoprenoid intermediates of the mevalonate pathway. Conclusions: Our data indicate that the anticancer effects of statins observed in numerous studies to a large extent are mediated through isoprenoid intermediates of the mevalonate pathway, as they influence expression of genes involved in multiple intracellular pathways. © 2017 The Author(s).","Farnesyl pyrophosphate; Gene expression; Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate; HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors; Isoprenoids; K-Ras oncogene; Mevalonate; Pancreatic cancer; Prenylation; Statins",Article,Scopus

Our goal was to describe the immunohistochemical profiles of type I EC according to grades and type II EC, to identify groups of interacting proteins using principal component analysis (PCA) and unsupervised clustering. We studied 13 immunohistochemical markers (steroid receptors, pro/anti-apoptotic proteins, metalloproteinases (MMP) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP), and CD44 isoforms known for their role in endometrial pathology. Co-expressed proteins associated with the type, grade and outcome of EC were determined by PCA and unsupervised clustering. PCA identified three functional groups of proteins from 43 tissue samples (38 type I and 5 type II EC): the first was characterized by p53 expression; the second by MMPs, bcl-2, PR B and CD44v6; and the third by ER alpha, PR A, TIMP-2 and CD44v3. Unsupervised clustering found two main clusters of proteins, with both type I grade 3 and type II EC exhibiting the same cluster profile.

A systematic literature review was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Med Ed Portal databases, and gray literature. All available prospective cohort studies, case reports, and narratives published up to July 2017 were eligible for review. Fourteen articles were identified and referenced palliative care education programs in Argentina, Uganda, Kenya, Australia, Germany, the USA, or multiple countries. The most common teaching strategy was lecture-based, followed by mentorship and experiential learning involving role play and simulation. Education topics included core principles of palliative care, pain and symptom management, and communication skills. Two programs included additional topics specific to the underserved or American Indian/Alaskan Native community. Only one program discussed supportive cancer care, and no program reported educational content on resource-stratified decision-making for palliative oncological treatment. Five programs reported positive participant satisfaction, and three programs described objective metrics of increased educational or research activity. There is scant literature on effective curricula for providers treating cancer patients in resource-limited settings.

Often, analyses are based on the response rate. This is the proportion of patients who have an observed tumour shrinkage above a predefined level and no new tumour lesions. The augmented binary method has been proposed to improve the precision of the estimator of the response rate. The method involves modelling the tumour shrinkage to avoid dichotomising it. However, in many trials the best observed response is used as the primary outcome. In such trials, patients are followed until progression, and their best observed RECIST outcome is used as the primary endpoint. In this paper, we propose a method that extends the augmented binary method so that it can be used when the outcome is best observed response. We show through simulated data and data from a real phase II cancer trial that this method improves power in both single-arm and randomised trials. The average gain in power compared to the traditional analysis is equivalent to approximately a 35% increase in sample size. A modified version of the method is proposed to reduce the computational effort required. We show this modified method maintains much of the efficiency advantages. © 2017 The Authors.

The information to be conveyed is complex, and it may be difficult to weigh up the risks and benefits of the different fertility preservation options available. This complexity is compounded by the widespread low levels of literacy and health literacy in Australia, which may result in greater difficulties in understanding available health information and in decision-making. Methods/design: A working group of experts have developed a fertility-related online decision aid for a low health literacy population, guided by health literacy principles. The decision aid will be pilot tested with 30 women diagnosed with early breast cancer between 5 years and 6 months previously. To be eligible, at the time of diagnosis, women must be between 18 and 40 years (inclusive), pre-menopausal, have no history of metastatic disease, have not completed their families, be able to give informed consent and have low health literacy. Participants will be asked to reflect back to the time in which they were diagnosed. Participants will complete a questionnaire before and after reviewing the decision aid to determine the feasibility, use and acceptability of the decision aid. The decision aid will be modified accordingly. Participants may also choose to review a previously developed (high literacy) decision aid and provide feedback in comparison to the low health literacy decision aid. Discussion: This project represents the first study to develop an online fertility decision aid developed from low health literacy models in the context of breast cancer. It is anticipated that the low health literacy decision aid will be useful and acceptable to young women with low health literacy who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and that it will be preferred over the high literacy decision aid. © 2017 The Author(s).","Breast cancer; Decision aid; Decision-making; Fertility; Fertility preservation; Low health literacy; Psychosocial issues; Unmet needs; Young women",Article,Scopus

Some 6% to 8% of opioid-näive patients undergoing noncancer procedures develop new persistent opioid use; however, it is unknown if a similar risk applies to patients with cancer. We sought to define the risk of new persistent opioid use after curative-intent surgery, identify risk factors, and describe changes in daily opioid dose over time after surgery. Methods: Using a national data set of insurance claims, we identified patients with cancer undergoing curativeintent surgery from 2010 to 2014. We included melanoma, breast, colorectal, lung, esophageal, and hepato-pancreato-biliary/gastric cancer. Primary outcomes were new persistent opioid use (opioidnäive patients who continued filling opioid prescriptions 90 to 180 days after surgery) and daily opioid dose (evaluated monthly during the year after surgery). Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for new persistent opioid use. Results: A total of 68,463 eligible patients underwent curative-intent surgery and filled opioid prescriptions. Among opioid-naïve patients, the risk of new persistent opioid use was 10.4% (95% CI, 10.1% to 10.7%). One year after surgery, these patients continued filling prescriptions with daily doses similar to chronic opioid users (P =.05), equivalent to six tablets per day of 5-mg hydrocodone. Those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy had modestly higher doses (P =.002), but patients with no chemotherapy still had doses equivalent to five tablets per day of 5-mg hydrocodone. Across different procedures, the covariate-adjusted risk of new persistent opioid use in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy was 15% to 21%, compared with 7% to 11% for those with no chemotherapy. Conclusion: New persistent opioid use is a common iatrogenic complication in patients with cancer undergoing curative-intent surgery.

However it is not clear, if such radiation alters the yeast itself. The aim of the present study was therefore to report the direct impact of gamma radiation on Candida tropicalis. Methods: C. tropicalis was obtained from a patient with a carcinoma, a suspension of this yeast containing 2.0 × 103 colony forming units per milliliter was prepared. It was submitted to gamma radiation dosage similar to that used in the treatment of head and neck cancer. After a cumulative dose of 7200 cGy some virulence attributes of C. tropicalis, including macro and micromorphological characteristics, adhesion and biofilm abilities, murine experimental infection and phagocytosis resistance were evaluated on irradiated and non-irradiated yeasts. Results: After irradiation the colony morphology of the yeast was altered from a ring format to a smooth appearance in most colonies. Scanning electron microscopy revealed notable differences in the structures of both these colonies and the yeast cells, with the loss of pseudohyphae following irradiation and an increase in extracellular matrix production. The adherence and biofilm production of the yeast was greater following irradiation, both in terms of the number of yeasts and total biomass production on several abiotic surfaces and TR146 cells. The phagocytic index of the irradiated yeasts was not statistically different; however, the presence of cellular debris was detected in the kidneys of infected animals. Mice infected with irradiated yeasts developed an infection at the site of the yeast inoculation, although systemic infection was unchanged. Conclusions: Our findings show for the first time that C. tropicalis, one of the most important yeasts from colonization, which cause fatal candidemia in cancer patients, is affected by gamma irradiation, with changes to its virulence profile. © 2017 The Author(s).","Biofilm; Candida tropicalis; Gamma radiation; Infection; Virulence",Article,Scopus

Patients did not receive thromboprophylactic treatment. Data was analyzed using repeated measures one-way ANOVA. Results: The standard coagulation parameters displayed only subtle changes after surgery and the ROTEM® and thrombin generation results remained largely unchanged. Conclusions: Patients undergoing VATS lobectomy are normocoagulable in the preoperative state and a VATS lobectomy does not significantly influence the coagulation.

Among obesity-related cancers, postmenopausal breast carcinoma is a well-studied one. Apart from an increase in certain types of lipids in obesity, excess adipose tissue releases many hormone-like cytokines/adipokines, which are usually pro-inflammatory in nature. Leptin is one of such adipokines and significantly linked with the intracellular signaling pathways of other growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). In general, HER2 is overexpressed in roughly 30% of breast carcinomas; its presence indicates aggressive tumor behavior. Conversely, HER2 has certain effects in normal conditions such as differentiation of preadipocytes, cardiovascular health and vitamin D metabolism. HER2 has no known endogenous ligand, but it may form dimers with other three members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family and can activate downstream signaling pathways. Furthermore, HER2 is intimately connected with several enzymes, e.g. fatty acid synthase (FASN), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), all of which play significant regulatory roles in lipogenic pathways or lipid metabolism. In obesity-related carcinogenesis, characteristics like insulin resistance and elevated IGF-1 are commonly observed. Both IGF-1 and leptin can modulate EGFR and HER2 signaling pathways. Although clinical studies have shown mixed results, the behavior of HER2+ tumor cells including HER2 levels can be altered by several factors such as obesity, leptin and fatty acids. A precise knowledge is useful in new therapeutic approaches against HER+ tumors. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","adipose tissue; cancer; ErbB-2; fatty acids; leptin",Review,Scopus

Despite maximum surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, the histological heterogeneity of GBM makes total eradication impossible, due to residual cancer cells invading the parenchyma, which is not otherwise seen in radiographic images. Even with gross total resection, the heterogeneity and the dormant nature of brain tumor initiating cells allow for therapeutic evasion, contributing to its recurrence and malignant progression, and severely impacting survival. Visual delimitation of the tumor’s margins with common surgical techniques is a challenge faced by many surgeons. In an attempt to achieve optimal safe resection, advances in approaches allowing intraoperative analysis of cancer and non-cancer tissue have been developed and applied in humans resulting in improved outcomes. In addition, functional paradigms based on stimulation techniques to map the brain’s electrical activity have optimized glioma resection in eloquent areas such as the Broca’s, Wernike’s and perirolandic areas. In this review, we will elaborate on the current standard therapy for newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma with a focus on surgical approaches. We will describe current technologies used for glioma resection, such as awake craniotomy, ﬂuorescence guided surgery, laser interstitial thermal therapy and intraoperative mass spectrometry.

Primary results indicated no difference between treatments in terms of progression-free survival (PFS). The current analysis presents final, mature, overall survival (OS) data, together with exploratory analyses that examined whether specific biomarkers, including T790M mutation status, were able to differentiate a relative treatment effect. Patients and Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to gefitinib 250 mg or placebo, in addition to cisplatin 75 mg/m2 plus pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 (maximum of six cycles of chemotherapy). EGFR mutation status was determined from plasma-derived circulating free tumor-derived DNA samples (beads, emulsification, amplification, and magnetics digital polymerase chain reaction assay, allelic fraction analysis). Results: A total of 265 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned, and overall data maturity was 66%. Continuation of gefitinib plus cisplatin and pemetrexed was detrimental to OS when compared with placebo plus cisplatin and pemetrexed (hazard ratio [HR], 1.44; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.94;P =.016; median OS, 13.4 v 19.5 months). The detriment was statistically significant inpatients with T790M mutation-positive plasma samples (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.21), whereas statistical significance was not reached in T790M mutation-negative patients (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.94). PFS in T790M mutation-positive patients was similar between treatments, and the difference observed in T790M mutation-negative patients did not reach statistical significance (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.03; P =.0745). Conclusion: Final OS data from IMPRESS are supportive of earlier PFS results and are sufficient to warn physicians against the continuation of treatment with first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors beyond radiologic disease progression when chemotherapy is initiated. Plasma biomarker analyses suggest that this effect may be driven by T790M-positive status. © 2017 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,Article,Scopus

The aims of this study were to identify cancer-bereaved adolescents’ and young adults’ ways of coping with grief after loss of a sibling, and examine whether these ways of coping were related to their experience of having worked through their grief. Method: This nationwide survey of 174 cancer-bereaved siblings (73% participation rate) is based on one open-ended question about coping with grief (“What has helped you to cope with your grief after your sibling's death?”) and one closed-ended question about siblings’ long-term grief (“Do you think you have worked through your grief over your sibling's death?”). The open-ended question was analyzed with content analysis; descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact test were used to examine the relation between type of coping and siblings’ long-term grief. Result: The siblings described four ways of coping: (1) thinking of their dead brother/sister and feeling and expressing their grief; (2) distracting or occupying themselves; (3) engaging in spiritual and religious beliefs/activities; and (4) waiting for time to pass. One of these categories of coping with grief, namely, engaging in spiritual and religious beliefs and activities, was associated with siblings’ experience of having worked through their grief two to nine years after the loss (p = 0.016). Significance of results: Those siblings who had used spirituality, religious beliefs, and activities to cope were more likely to have worked through their grief than those who had not.

However, its use is hindered by the poor solubility and slow diffusion in the cytoplasm. To address these problems, we designed and prepared aqueous dispersible nanoparticles (NPs) containing integrated components including triphenylphosphine (TPP) to target the mitochondria of cells and LND and doxorubicin (DOX) for synergistic cancer treatment and conquering drug resistance. This design allows the NPs to concentrate in the mitochondria of cells, solve the low solubility of LND, and contain very high load of LND and DOX in comparison with previously reported drug-delivery systems based on various carrier nanomaterials. Detailed mechanism studies reveal that TPP-LND-DOX NPs could induce significant reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial membrane potential decrease, and mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, thereby leading to great cytotoxicity in cancer cells. In vivo anticancer activities indicate that TPP-LND-DOX NPs exhibit the highest efficacy in tumor inhibition among all tested groups and show high effectiveness in drug-resistant model.

In this article, we concentrate on parametric multistate models, both Markov and semi-Markov, and develop a flexible framework where each transition can be specified by a variety of parametric models including exponential, Weibull, Gompertz, Royston-Parmar proportional hazards models or log-logistic, log-normal, generalised gamma accelerated failure time models, possibly sharing parameters across transitions. We also extend the framework to allow time-dependent effects. We then use an efficient and generalisable simulation method to calculate transition probabilities from any fitted multistate model, and show how it facilitates the simple calculation of clinically useful measures, such as expected length of stay in each state, and differences and ratios of proportion within each state as a function of time, for specific covariate patterns.

ESCC mortality rates stand very close to its incidence, which is a direct consequence of a late diagnosis and an inefficient treatment. Although this scenery is quite alarming, the major molecular alterations that drive this carcinogenesis process remain unclear. We have previously shown through the first ESCC methylome analysis that TFF1 promoter is frequently hypermethylated in ESCC. Here, to evaluate TFF1 methylation as a potential biomarker of early ESCC diagnosis, we investigated the status of TFF1 promoter methylation and its expression in ESSC and histologically normal tumor surrounding tissue of ESCC patients in comparison to healthy esophagus of non-cancer individuals. Results: Analysis of TFF1 promoter methylation, and gene and protein expression in 65 ESCC patients and 88 controls revealed that TFF1 methylation levels were already increased in histologically normal tumor surrounding tissue of ESCC patients when compared to healthy esophagus of non-cancer individuals. This increase in DNA methylation was followed by the reduction of TFF1 mRNA expression. Interestingly, TFF1 expression was capable of distinguishing tumor surrounding normal tissue from normal mucosa of healthy individuals with 92% accuracy. In addition, TFF1 protein was undetectable both in tumor and surrounding mucosa by immunohistochemistry, while submucosa glands of the healthy esophagus showed positive staining. Furthermore, treatment of TE-1 and TE-13 ESCC cell lines with decitabine led to a reduction of promoter methylation and consequent upregulation of TFF1 gene and protein expression. Finally, using TCGA data we showed that TFF1 loss is observed in ESCC, but not in esophageal adenocarcinoma, highlighting the different molecular mechanisms involved in the development of each histological subtype of esophageal cancer. Conclusions: This study shows that TFF1 expression is silenced in early phases of ESCC development, which seems to be mediated at least in part by promoter hypermethylation, and provides the basis for the use of TFF1 expression as a potential biomarker for early ESCC detection. © 2017 The Author(s).","Biomarker; DNA methylation; Esophageal cancer; Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; TFF1; Trefoil factors",Article,Scopus

After the stimulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the different effects and possible molecular mechanisms of 6-shogoal on H2O2-induced oxidative damage in human intestinal epithelial cells (NCM460) and in situ colon cancer cells (HCT116) cells in vitro were investigated. Inverted microscope was used to observe the changes of cell morphology in HCT116 and NCM460 induced by H2O2 with different concentrations of 6-shogoal. CCK-8 (Cell Counting Kit-8) method was used to screen the concentration interval of 6-shogaol and the cell survival rate was determined. Annexin and V-FITC/PI cytometry were used to detect apoptosis of different groups. The expressions of related apoptotic proteins (Caspase-3, poly (ADP- ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), MCC1, A2F, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)) were detected by Western-blot. As compared with the model group, 6-shogaol could reduce the expressions of caspase-3, PARP-1, MCC-1, A2F and promote the expression of Bcl-2 (p&lt;0.05) in NCM460 induced by H2O2, indicating that 6-shogaol had anti-oxidant and pro-proliferative effects (p&lt;0.05). However, 6-shogoal could promote the expression of caspase3, PARP-1, MCC1 and A2F, and inhibit the expression of Bcl-2 (p&lt;0.05) in HCT116 induced by H2O2, indicating that 6-shogaol could enhance the oxidative damage of HCT116 induced by H2O2 and inhibit cell proliferation (p&lt;0.05). It could be concluded that 6-shogaol had different opposite effects in NCM460 and HCT116 induced by H2O2, which might provide guidance for further studies on specific mechanisms or pathways of 6-shogoal against colorectal cancer. © 2017, Editorial Board of Modern Food Science and Technology.

Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a critical regulator of the metabolism, growth and metastasis of cancer cells, has been confirmed to be overexpressed in various human cancer including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the oncogenic functions of HSP90 and PKM2 overexpression in HCC remain unknown. Methods: The expression of HSP90 and PKM2 in HCC specimens and cells were detected by immunoblotting and immunostaining. The interaction between HSP90 and PKM2 was confirmed by tandem affinity purification, co-immunoprecipitation and Glutathione S transferase (GST)-pulldown assay. Results: In this study, we found that HSP90 could bind to PKM2 and subsequently increased PKM2 abundance in HCC cells. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining showed that HSP90 level was positively correlated with PKM2 level in HCC tissues. Mechanistically, HSP90 was found to increase the phosphorylation of PKM2 at Thr-328. Protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) formed a protein complex with HSP90 and PKM2, and directly mediated Thr-328 phosphorylation of PKM2 induced by HSP90. Thr-328 phosphorylation was critical for maintaining PKM2 stability and its biological functions in regulating glycolysis, mitochondria respiration, proliferation and apoptosis. Functionally, we found that HSP90 promoted the glycolysis and proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of HCC cells in a PKM2 dependent manner. In vivo experiments disclosed that PKM2 was required for the promoting effects of HSP90 on the growth of HCC cells in mice. Furthermore, we demonstrated that positive expression of HSP90 and PKM2 was correlated with poor clinicopathological features including high alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level, large tumor size, portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) and advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. Furthermore, we demonstrated that positive expression of HSP90 and PKM2, and a combination of these proteins could strongly predict the poor prognosis of HCC patients. Conclusions: We suggest that HSP90 potentiates the glycolysis and proliferation, reduces the apoptosis and thus enhances the growth of HCC cells through PKM2. © 2017 The Author(s).","Glycolysis; Growth; Hepatocellular carcinoma; HSP90; PKM2",Article,Scopus

So, women of childbearing age must be sure to have an adequate folate intake periconceptionally, prior to and during pregnancy. Folic acid fortification of all enriched cereal grain product flour has been implemented in many countries. Thus, hundreds of thousands of people have been exposed to an increased intake of folic acid. Folate plays an essential role in the biosynthesis of methionine. Methionine is the principal aminopropyl donor required for polyamine biosynthesis, which is up-regulated in actively growing cells, including cancer cells. Folates are important in RNA and DNA synthesis, DNA stability and integrity. Clinical and epidemiological evidence links folate deficiency to DNA damage and cancer. On the other hand, long-term folate oversupplementation leads to adverse toxic effects, resulting in the appearance of malignancy. Considering the relationship of polyamines and rapidly proliferating tissues (especially cancers), there is a need for better investigation of the relationship between the ingestion of high amounts of folic acid in food supplementation and polyamine metabolism, related to malignant processes in the human body. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","cancerogenesis; folic acid supplementation; polyamines",Review,Scopus

Ideally, an effective vaccine formulation would deliver multiple tumor antigens in a fashion that potently stimulates endogenous immune responses against those antigens. Here, it is reported on the fabrication of a biomimetic, nanoparticulate anticancer vaccine that is capable of delivering autologously derived tumor antigen material together with a highly immunostimulatory adjuvant. The two major components, tumor antigens and adjuvant, are presented concurrently in a fashion that maximizes their ability to promote effective antigen presentation and activation of downstream immune processes. Ultimately, it is demonstrated that the formulation can elicit potent antitumor immune responses in vivo. When combined with additional immunotherapies such as checkpoint blockades, the nanovaccine demonstrates substantial therapeutic effect.

However, in patients with metastatic mediastinal lymph nodes (pN2) or non-radically resected primary tumors (R1/R2), postoperative radiotherapy (possibly combined with chemotherapy) is indicated. So far, investigations about time factors affecting postoperative radiotherapy have only examined the waiting time defined as interval between surgery and start of radiotherapy, but not the overall treatment time (OTT) itself. Conversely, results from trials on primary radio(chemo)therapy in NSCLC show that longer OTT correlates with significantly worse local tumor control and overall survival rates. This time factor of primary radio(chemo)therapy is thought to mainly be based on repopulation of surviving tumor cells between irradiation fractions. It remains to be elucidated if such an effect also occurs when patients with NSCLC are treated with postoperative radiotherapy after surgery (and chemotherapy). Our own retrospective data suggest an advantage of shorter OTT also for postoperative radiotherapy in this patient group. Methods/design: This is a multicenter, prospective randomized trial investigating whether an accelerated course of postoperative radiotherapy with photons or protons (7 fractions per week, 2 Gy fractions) improves locoregional tumor control in NSCLC patients in comparison to conventional fractionation (5 fractions per week, 2 Gy fractions). Target volumes and total radiation doses will be stratified in both treatment arms based on individual risk factors. Discussion: For the primary endpoint of the study we postulate an increase in local tumor control from 70% to 85% after 36 months. Secondary endpoints are overall survival of patients; local recurrence-free and distant metastases-free survival after 36 months; acute and late toxicity and quality of life for both treatment methods.

Compared with free drugs, the self-assembled CPT-ss-Ara nanoparticles can concentrate in tumor tissues through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, then they can be rapidly internalized by tumor cells and degrade into free drugs for killing the tumor cells when exposed to the reductive environment (GSH) of tumor cells, thereby reducing the injury to normal cells. Meanwhile, the CPT-ss-Ara nanoparticles can effectively protect CPT and Ara-C molecules from biological inactivation before their arrival in tumor microenvironment since free CPT and Ara-C are easy to partly lose their therapy efficacy due to their structure degradation in blood circulation. The in vitro and in vivo anticancer experimental results indicate that simultaneous release of free CPT and Ara-C can realize synergistic chemotherapy effects, thus markedly improve their anticancer activity.

In this project, nontoxic, biodegradable, and modularly tunable micellar delivery systems were generated using two types of dendron-polymer conjugates. Either an AB type dendron-polymer construct with 2K PEG or an ABA type dendron-polymer-dendron conjugate with 6K PEG based middle block was used as primary construct; along with an AB type dendron-polymer containing a cRGDfK targeting group to actively target cancer cells overexpressing αÏ...β3/αÏ...β5 integrins. A set of micelles encapsulating docetaxel, a widely employed chemotherapy drug, were prepared with varying feed ratios of primary construct and targeting group containing secondary construct. Critical micelle concentrations of all micellar systems were in the range of 10-6 M. DLS measurements indicated hydrodynamic size distributions varying between 170 to 200 nm. An increase in docetaxel release at acidic pH was observed for all micelles. Enhanced cellular internalization of Nile red doped micelles by MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells suggested that the most efficient uptake was observed with targeted micelles. In vitro cytotoxicity experiments on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and A549 lung carcinoma cell lines showed improved toxicity for RGD containing micelles. For A549 cell line EC50 values of drug loaded micellar sets were in the range of 10-9 M whereas EC50 value of free docetaxel was around 10-10 M.

These drugs are frequently associated with toxicity events that result in dose adjustments and even suspension of the treatment. The thymidylate synthase (TYMS) gene is a potential marker of response and toxicity to fluoropyirimidines as this enzyme is the molecular target of these drugs. Our aim was to assess the association between variants of TYMS with response and toxicity to fluoropyrimidines in patients with CRC in independent retrospective and prospective studies. Variants namely rs45445694, rs183205964, rs2853542 and rs151264360 of TYMS were genotyped in 105 CRC patients and were evaluated to define their association with clinical response and toxicity to fluoropyrimidines. Additionally, the relationship between genotypes and tumor gene expression was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The 2R/2R (rs45445694) was associated with clinical response (p=0.05, odds ratio (OR)=3.45) and severe toxicity (p=0.0014, OR=5.21, from pooled data). Expression analysis in tumor tissues suggested a correlation between the 2R/2R genotype and low TYMS expression. The allele 2R (rs45445694) predicts severe toxicity and objective response in advanced CRC patients. In addition, the alleles G(rs2853542) and 6bp-(rs151264360) are independent predictors of response failure to chemotherapy. This is the first study made on a Latin American population that points out TYMS gene variants have predictive values for response and toxicity in patients with CRC treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","colorectal cancer; fluoropyrimidines; objective response rate; toxicity; TYMS; variants",Article,Scopus

Anxiety and depression as negative mental outcomes in the three groups, as well as fear of progression in DM and CCS were examined. A total of 107 participants with ages ranging from 18 to 35 years were examined: CCS (n=33), type 1 diabetics (n=39) and peers without a history of chronic disease (n=35). PTG and negative psychosocial outcomes were assessed with self-report questionnaires. There was a significant difference between the groups regarding PTG. On a subscale level DM reported higher appreciation of life (p=0.024), higher personal strength (p=0.010), and more new possibilities (p=0.010) compared to CG. CCS experienced higher spiritual changes than DM (p=0.050). DM reported higher levels of anxiety compared to CCS (p=0.026) and CG (p=0.049). Depression was higher in DM compared to CG (p=0.003). Fear of progression was higher in DM compared to CCS (p<0.001). These findings show that psychological growth was experienced by young CCS and participants with DM. Furthermore, these findings highlight that adolescents with a significant health diagnosis in childhood or youth can undergo a similar or even more positive psychosocial development as peers without a history of chronic disease. However, young type 1 diabetics seem to be a more vulnerable group in terms of anxiety, depression and fear of progression. © 2017 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","anxiety; childhood cancer survivor; depression; posttraumatic growth; type 1 diabetes",Article,Scopus

However, applications of some photosensitizers remain an obstacle by their poor photostability. To enhance the treatment efficiency of photosensitizers and tumor theranostic effect, herein, we reported a novel carrier-free, theranostic nanodrug by self-assembly of small molecule dual anticancer drugs and photosensitizer for tumor targeting. The developed carrier-free small molecule nanodrug delivery system was formed by hydrophobic ursolic acid, paclitaxel, and amphipathic indocyanine green (ICG) associated with electrostatic, π-π stacking, and hydrophobic interactions exhibiting water stability. The self-assembling of ICG on the dual anticancer nanodrug significantly enhanced water solubility of hydrophobic anticancer drugs and ICG photostability contributing to long-term near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging and effective chemophototherapy of tumor. The in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging showed that the theranostic nanodrug could be targeted to the tumor site via a potential enhanced permeability and retention effect proving the efficient accumulation of nanoparticles in the tumor site. Dramatically, chemophototherapy of tumor-bearing mice in vivo almost completely suppressed tumor growth and no tumor recurrence was observed. Encouraged by its carrier-free, prominent imaging and effective therapy, the small molecule nanodrug via self-assembly will provide a promising strategy for synergistic cancer theranostics. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","cancer theranostics; carrier-free; chemophototherapy; NIR fluorescence imaging; self-assembly",Article,Scopus

Methods A total of 91 cN0 squamous cell lung carcinoma patients who underwent curative surgery and pretreatment 18F-FDG PET/CT were enrolled retrospectively. Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of primary tumor were obtained with standardized uptake value (SUV) threshold of 2.5. ROC curve analysis was performed to quantify the predictive value of SUVmax, MTV, TLG and the maximal tumor length. To identify risk factors for OLM, univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analysis were performed. Results Of 91 patients, 26 had OLM. Significantly higher SUVmax, MTV, TLG and the maximal tumor length were observed in patients with OLM compared with negative occult lymph node metastasis (all P&lt;0.05). ROC curve showed that the cutoff point of SUVmax, MTV, TLG and the maximal tumor length were 12.76, 31.17 cm3, 153.13 and 3.8 cm, respectively.

Patients and Methods: KEYNOTE-028 (NCT02054806) is a nonrandomized, multicohort, phase Ib trial of pembrolizumab in patients with PD-L1-positive advanced solid tumors. Key eligibility criteria for the NPC cohort included unresectable or metastatic disease, failure on prior standard therapy, and PD-L1 expression in 1% or more of tumor cells or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Patients received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks up to 2 years or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) per investigator review. Tumor response was assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; version 1.1) every 8 weeks for the first 6 months and every 12 weeks thereafter. Results: Twenty-seven patients received pembrolizumab. Median age was 52.0 years (range, 18 to 68 years); 92.6% received prior therapies for RM-NPC; 70.4% had received three or more therapies. Partial response and stable disease were observed in seven and 14 patients, respectively, for an ORR of 25.9% (95% CI, 11.1 to 46.3) overamedian follow-up of 20 months.

Methods: To develop and validate nomograms for OS and PFS, we used a derivation cohort of 493 patients with OPSCC with known p16 tumor status (surrogate of human papillomavirus) and cigarette smoking history (pack-years) randomly assigned to clinical trials using platinum-based chemoradiotherapy (NRG Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group [RTOG] 0129 and 0522). Nomograms were created from Cox models and internally validated by use of bootstrap and crossvalidation. Model discrimination was measured by calibration plots and the concordance index. Nomograms were externally validated in a cohort of 153 patients with OPSCC randomly assigned to a third trial, NRG Oncology RTOG 9003. Results: Both models included age, Zubrod performance status, pack-years, education, p16 status, and T and N stage; the OS model also included anemia and age × pack-years interaction; and the PFS model also included marital status, weight loss, and p16 × Zubrod interaction. Predictions correlated well with observed 2-year and 5-year outcomes. The uncorrected concordance index was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.80) for OS and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.74) for PFS, and bias-corrected indices were similar. In the validation set, OS and PFS models were well calibrated, and OS and PFS were significantly different across tertiles of nomogram scores (log-rank P =.003;<.001).

We have previously shown that event-free survival (EFS) at 24 months (EFS24) is a clinically useful end point in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Here, we assess EFS24 and subsequent overall survival (OS) in large, multinational PTCL cohorts. Patients and Methods: Patients with systemic PTCL newly diagnosed from 2000 to 2012 and treated with curative intent were included from the United States and Sweden (initial cohorts) and from Canada (replication cohort). EFS was defined as time from date of diagnosis to progression after primary treatment, retreatment, or death. Subsequent OS was measured after achieving EFS24 or from the time of progression if it occurred within 24 months. OS rates were compared with the age-, sex-, and country-matched general population. Results: Seven hundred seventy-five patients were included in the study (the median age at diagnosis was 64 years; 63% were men). Results were similar in the initial and replication cohorts, and a combined analysis was undertaken. Sixty-four percent of patients progressed within the first 24 months and had a median OS of only 4.9 months (5-year OS, 11%). In contrast, median OS after achieving EFS24 was not reached (5-year OS, 78%), although relapses within 5 years of achieving EFS24 occurred in 23% of patients. Superior outcomes after achieving EFS24 were observed in younger patients (≤ 60 years of age: 5-year OS, 91%). Conclusion: EFS24 stratifies subsequent outcome in PTCL. Patients with PTCL with primary refractory disease or early relapse have extremely poor survival. However, more than one third of patients with PTCL remain in remission 2 years after diagnosis with encouraging subsequent OS, especially in younger patients. These marked differences in outcome suggest that EFS24 has utility for patient counseling, study design, and risk stratification in PTCL. © 2017 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,Conference Paper,Scopus

Most cases are incidental findings observed during pathological examinations after resection of the prostate. To the best of our knowledge, only few studies have reported the conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of such tumors; however, no reports have described the ultra-high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) findings of prostatic leiomyomas. Case presentation: We report MR imaging characteristics and surgical pathologic findings of a case of prostatic leiomyoma treated by robot-assisted transperitoneal laparoscopic approach. Typical MR features showed a homogeneous lesion with slightly hypointense signal compared to the skeletal muscle on T2-weighted images, and isointense signal relative to the muscle on T1-weighted images with fat suppression, which collectively demonstrate apparent homogeneous enhancement with a non-enhanced envelope. A slightly hyperintense signal compared to the skeletal muscle was observed on ultra-high b-value DWI, and higher ADC values were observed as compared to the prostate cancer. Conclusions: Prostatic leiomyoma is a benign tumor. This case indicates that MRI features of prostatic leiomyoma are helpful for the differential diagnosis of prostate cancer. © 2017 The Author(s).","Diffusion weighted imaging; Leiomyoma; Magnetic resonance imaging; Prostate",Article,Scopus

It is unknown to what extent macrophages derived from peripheral blood adopt the phenotype of brain-resident microglia in pre-treatment gliomas. The relative proportions of blood-derived macrophages and microglia have been poorly quantified in clinical samples due to a paucity of markers that distinguish these cell types in malignant tissue. Results: We perform single-cell RNA-sequencing of human gliomas and identify phenotypic differences in TAMs of distinct lineages. We isolate TAMs from patient biopsies and compare them with macrophages from non-malignant human tissue, glioma atlases, and murine glioma models. We present a novel signature that distinguishes TAMs by ontogeny in human gliomas. Blood-derived TAMs upregulate immunosuppressive cytokines and show an altered metabolism compared to microglial TAMs. They are also enriched in perivascular and necrotic regions. The gene signature of blood-derived TAMs, but not microglial TAMs, correlates with significantly inferior survival in low-grade glioma. Surprisingly, TAMs frequently co-express canonical pro-inflammatory (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) genes in individual cells. Conclusions: We conclude that blood-derived TAMs significantly infiltrate pre-treatment gliomas, to a degree that varies by glioma subtype and tumor compartment. Blood-derived TAMs do not universally conform to the phenotype of microglia, but preferentially express immunosuppressive cytokines and show an altered metabolism. Our results argue against status quo therapeutic strategies that target TAMs indiscriminately and in favor of strategies that specifically target immunosuppressive blood-derived TAMs. © 2017 The Author(s).","Glioma; Immunotherapy; Macrophage; Single-cell sequencing",Article,Scopus

Material/Methods: Data of 93 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic and open partial nephrectomy from September 2015 to June 2016 were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Preoperative radiological elements were independently assessed by 2 readers. Ordinal logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate radiological and clinicopathologic influencing factors of MAP score. Results: On univariate analysis, MAP score was associated with male sex, older age, higher body mass index (BMI), history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and perirenal fat thickness (posterolateral, lateral, anterior, anterolateral, and medial). On multivariate analysis, only posterolateral perirenal fat thickness (odds ratio [OR]=0.88 [0.82-0.95], p=0.001), medial perirenal fat thickness (OR=0.90 [0.83-0.98], p=0.01), and history of diabetes mellitus (OR=5.42 [1.74-16.86], p=0.004) remained statistically significant. Tumor type (malignant vs. benign) was not statistically different. In patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), there was no difference in tumor stage or grade. Conclusions: MAP score is significantly correlated with some preoperative factors such as posterolateral and medial perirenal fat thickness and diabetes mellitus.

Peptide nucleic acid (PNA), a DNA analogue that is typically synthesized by solid phase peptide chemistry, has been conjugated to a variety of cell penetrating peptides (CPP) as a means of improving its cellular uptake. These CPPs typically deliver their cargoes into cells by an endosomal-dependent mechanism resulting in lower bioavailability of the cargo. Herein, we designed and synthesized PNA-peptide conjugates as splice switching oligonucleotides (SSO) targeting the Mnk2 gene, a therapeutic target in cancer. In humans, the MKNK2 gene, is alternatively spliced, generating isoforms with opposite biological activities: Mnk2a and Mnk2b. It was found that the Mnk2a isoform is down-regulated in breast, lung, brain, and colon tumors and is a tumor suppressor, whereas MnK2b is oncogenic. We have designed and synthesized PNAs that were conjugated to either of the following peptides: A nuclear localization sequence (NLS) or a cytosol localizing internalization peptide (CLIP6). CLIP6-PNA demonstrates effective cellular uptake and exclusively employs a nonendosomal mechanism to cross the cellular membranes of glioblastoma cells (U87).

However, when used as stand-alone therapeutics or as warheads for small molecule drug conjugates (SMDCs), dose-limiting toxicities are often observed. As an elegant solution to this inherent problem, we designed diazepine-ring-opened conjugated prodrugs lacking the imine moiety. Once the prodrug (pro-PBD) conjugate enters a targeted cell, cleavage of the linker system triggers the generation of a reactive intermediate possessing an aldehyde and aromatic amine. An intramolecular ring-closing reaction subsequently takes place as the aromatic amine adds to the aldehyde with the loss of water to give the imine and, as a result, the diazepine ring. In our pro-PBDs, we mask the aldehyde as a hydrolytically sensitive oxazolidine moiety which in turn is a part of a reductively labile self-immolative linker system. To prove the range of applications for this new class of latent DNA-alkylators, we designed and synthesized several novel latent warheads: pro-PBD dimers and hybrids of pro-PBD with other sequence-selective DNA minor groove binders.

The Lym-1 antibody targets a conformational epitope of Human Leukocyte Antigen-antigen D Related (HLA-DR) on the surface of human B-cell lymphomas. Lym-1 CAR T cells were thus generated for evaluation of cytotoxic activity towards lymphoma cells in vitro and in vivo.

Methods: Consecutive patients with a pathologically confirmed malignancy and 1-3 intracranial lesions that had been documented within the last decade were selected from the databases of three hospitals in China. Results: A total of 250 patients were enrolled; of them, 135 received radiotherapy alone and 115 received radiotherapy plus systemic therapy.

Sapofectosid was produced from plant raw material by chromatographic methods and characterized by tandem mass spectrometry and intensive one and two dimensional NMR-spectroscopy. Sapofectosid did enhance the transfection efficiency of different DNA- and RNA-nanoplexes formulated with liposomes, polyethylenimine (PEI) or targeted and non-targeted oligo-lysine peptides. All nanoplexes were characterized physicochemically and the influence of sapofectosid on the nanoplex integrity was determined by DNA complexation assays. The nanoplexes and sapofectosid were administered to a variety of cancer cell lines and the transfection efficiency was investigated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Dependent on the cell line the transfection efficiencies varied from 6 to 76%. The saponin- and receptor-mediated endocytosis of nanoplexes was investigated by flow cytometry. As demonstrated by impedance based live cell imaging sapofection was non-toxic.

Methods: FDG-PET/CT scans from January 2007–January 2016 containing the term ‘fat necrosis’ were reviewed. Lesions meeting radiological criteria of fat necrosis in patients with prior abdominal surgery were included. Results: Forty-four patients, 30 males, mean age 68.4 ± 11.0 years. Surgeries: laparotomy (n=37; 84.1 %), laparoscopy (n=3; 6.8 %), unknown (n=4; 9.1 %). CTs of all lesions included hyperdense well-defined rims surrounding a heterogeneous fatty core. Sites: peritoneum (n=34; 77 %), omental fat (n=19; 43 %), subcutaneous fat (n=8; 18 %), retroperitoneum (n=2; 5 %). Mean lesion long axis: 33.6±24.9 mm (range: 13.0–140.0). Mean SUVmax: 2.6±1.1 (range: 0.6–5.1). On serial CTs (n=34), lesions decreased in size (p=0.022). Serial FDG-PET/CT (n=24) showed no significant change in FDG-avidity (p=0.110). Mean SUVmax did not correlate with time from surgery (p=0.558) or lesion size (p=0.259). Conclusion: Postsurgical fat necrosis demonstrated characteristic CT features and may demonstrate increased FDG uptake. However, follow-up of subsequent imaging scans showed no increases in size or FDG-avidity. Awareness of this entity is important to avoid misinterpretation of findings as recurrent cancer. Key Points: • Postsurgical fat necrosis may mimic cancer in FDG-PET/CT.• Follow-up of fat necrosis showed no increase in FDG intensity.• CT follow-up showed a decrease in lesion size.• FDG uptake did not correlate with time lapsed from surgery. © 2017 European Society of Radiology","Abdominal; Fat necrosis; FDG PET-CT; Pitfall; Postoperative",Article in Press,Scopus

In this study, a CD44 and N-cadherin dual targeting drug delivery system based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) has been successfully constructed for inhibiting tumour cell invasion and metastasis. Amino modified MSN (MSN/NH 2 ) was first synthesized and then functionalized with hyaluronic acid (HA) and ADH-1, constructing the carrier ADH-1-HA-MSN. Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) was selected as a model anticancer drug. The prepared vector had a spherical shape with a narrow distribution of particle size. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy studies showed that the modification with HA significantly enhanced CD44-mediated cellular uptake of this nanocarrier. ADH-1-HA-MSN/DOX exhibited higher cytotoxicity compared to non-ADH-1 modified counterparts. Of note, a transwell chamber assay demonstrated that the migration and invasion of tumour cells were markedly inhibited by ADH-1-HA-MSN/DOX. Furthermore, Western blotting analysis revealed that ADH-1-HA-MSN/DOX inhibited tumour cell invasion and metastasis by down-regulating N-cadherin expression. Taken together, these results indicated that ADH-1-HA-MSN might be a promising targeted drug delivery system for inhibiting cancer invasion and metastasis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","ADH-1; Drug delivery; Hyaluronic acid; Invasion and metastasis; Mesoporous silica nanoparticles",Article,Scopus

It requires exact delineation of the nasopharynx gross tumor volume (GTVnx), the metastatic lymph node gross tumor volume (GTVnd), the clinical target volume (CTV), and organs at risk in the planning computed tomography images. However, this task is time-consuming and operator dependent. In the present study, we developed an end-to-end deep deconvolutional neural network (DDNN) for segmentation of these targets. Methods: The proposed DDNN is an end-to-end architecture enabling fast training and testing. It consists of two important components: an encoder network and a decoder network. The encoder network was used to extract the visual features of a medical image and the decoder network was used to recover the original resolution by deploying deconvolution. A total of 230 patients diagnosed with NPC stage I or stage II were included in this study. Data from 184 patients were chosen randomly as a training set to adjust the parameters of DDNN, and the remaining 46 patients were the test set to assess the performance of the model. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used to quantify the segmentation results of the GTVnx, GTVnd, and CTV. In addition, the performance of DDNN was compared with the VGG-16 model. Results: The proposed DDNN method outperformed the VGG-16 in all the segmentation. The mean DSC values of DDNN were 80.9% for GTVnx, 62.3% for the GTVnd, and 82.6% for CTV, whereas VGG-16 obtained 72.3, 33.7, and 73.7% for the DSC values, respectively. Conclusion: DDNN can be used to segment the GTVnx and CTV accurately. The accuracy for the GTVnd segmentation was relatively low due to the considerable differences in its shape, volume, and location among patients. The accuracy is expected to increase with more training data and combination of MR images. In conclusion, DDNN has the potential to improve the consistency of contouring and streamline radiotherapy workflows, but careful human review and a considerable amount of editing will be required. © 2017 Men, Chen, Zhang, Zhang, Dai, Yi and Li.","Automatic segmentation; Deep deconvolutional neural network; Deep learning; Radiotherapy; Target volume",Article,Scopus

However, it is not known whether activation of non-SMAD TGF-β signaling (e.g., RAS–RAF–MEK–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling) is required for cell migration and whether it is also dependent on PAR2. Methods: RNA interference was used to deplete cells of PAR2, followed by xCELLigence technology to measure cell migration, phospho-immunoblotting to assess ERK1/2 activation, and co-immunoprecipitation to detect a PAR2–ALK5 physical interaction. Results: Inhibition of ERK signaling with the MEK inhibitor U0126 blunted the ability of TGF-β1 to induce migration in pancreatic cancer Panc1 cells. ERK activation in response to PAR2 agonistic peptide (PAR2–AP) was strong and rapid, while it was moderate and delayed in response to TGF-β1. Basal and TGF-β1-dependent ERK, but not SMAD activation, was blocked by U0126 in Panc1 and other cell types indicating that ERK activation is downstream or independent of SMAD signaling. Moreover, cellular depletion of PAR2 in HaCaT cells strongly inhibited TGF-β1-induced ERK activation, while the biased PAR2 agonist GB88 at 10 and 100 M potentiated TGF-β1-dependent ERK activation and cell migration. Finally, we provide evidence for a physical interaction between PAR2 and ALK5. Our data show that both PAR2–APand TGF-β1-induced cell migration depend on ERK activation, that PAR2 expression is crucial for TGF-β1-induced ERK activation, and that the functional cooperation of PAR2 and TGF-β1 involves a physical interaction between PAR2 and ALK5. © 2017 by the authors.

Phytoestrogens affect the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of MECs. However, it remains unclear whether phytoestrogens are involved in the blood-milk barrier. Therefore, we investigated the influence of phytoestrogens (coumestrol, genistein, and daidzein) by using an in vitro mouse-MEC-culture model. The results showed that coumestrol and genistein changed the expression of TJ proteins (claudins-3 and -4 and occludin), weakened barrier function, and reduced β-casein production. Daidzein also weakened barrier function without inhibiting β-casein production. Additionally, coumestrol and genistein induced apoptosis in MECs.

P70 ribosomal S6 kinase1 (S6K1) is a member of serine/threonine kinases and can be phosphorylated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1). S6K1 is widely reported to play important roles in cancers and metabolic diseases, but the role of S6K1 and the importance of phosphorylation on Thr229 in platelet activation have not been defined. PF-4708671 is a recently synthesized highly specific inhibitor of S6K1. In this study, we tested PF-4708671 to assess the role of S6K1 in platelet. PF-4708671 facilitated mouse and human platelet aggregation and ATP secretion induced by collagen, thrombin, and adenosine diphosphate through enhanced Akt and Gsk3β phosphorylation. PF-4708671 also accelerated integrin αIIbβ3-mediated clot retraction and spreading. Intravenously given PF-4708671 shortened the occlusion time in arterial thrombosis model. Further results demonstrated that S6K1 was phosphorylated by PDK1 on Thr229 in the resting platelets and dephosphorylated in response to agonist stimulation. PDK1-deficient mice showed higher aggregation when PI3K–Akt–Gsk3β signaling was blocked by the Gsk3β-inhibitor SB216763. Thus, S6K1 Thr229 phosphorylation might function as a regulator that prevents platelets from activation.

Conjugation requires site-specific and efficient covalent bond formation without impairing the activity of both biomolecules. Herein, we have focused on the use of a microbial transglutaminase (MTG) that catalyzes the cross-linking reaction between a glutamine residue and a primary amine. In a model bioconjugation, a highly MTG-reactive Gln (Q)-donor peptide (FYPLQMRG, FQ) was fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (FQ-EGFP) and a primary amine-clustered DNA aptamer was enzymatically synthesized as a novel acyl-acceptor substrate of MTG, whose combination leads to efficient and convenient preparation of DNA-protein conjugates with high purity. Dual functionality of the obtained DNA-EGFP conjugate was evaluated by discrimination of cancer cells via c-Met receptor recognition ability of the DNA aptamer. The DNA aptamer-EGFP conjugate only showed fluorescence toward cells with c-Met overexpression, indicating the retention of the biochemical properties of the DNA and EGFP in the conjugated form. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,Article,Scopus

Preclinical data suggest KDs affect inflammation and cytokine release. It is unknown whether KDs affect white blood cell (WBC) counts over time. This is particularly important in clinical populations who may be immune-suppressed at baseline, such as those with cancer or autoimmune disorders. Methods: A retrospective review of 125 consecutive adults seen at the Adult Epilepsy Diet Center (AEDC) was conducted. Clinical data regarding compliance, laboratory data, weights, and diet records were collected. A control cohort consisted of patients evaluated at the AEDC who elected not to complete a prescribed KD. Results: In 52 adults on KDs, there was a small but statistically significant decrease in WBC and absolute neutrophil counts at 6 and 12 months into KD therapy. There was no effect on lymphocyte counts. This pattern was also seen in a small population of patients with gliomas (n = 10) on KDs, most (n = 8) of whom had also received chemotherapy and radiation, putting them at risk for bone marrow suppression. Across both glioma and non-glioma groups, patients with pre-existing lymphopenia did not have further worsening of their counts on the KD. Conclusions: In this retrospective case-control study, a small but significant decrease in total WBC and neutrophil counts was observed in patients with epilepsy treated with the KDs. These patterns are similar in patients with and without gliomas suggesting baseline immunosuppression does not worsen with KD.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of 247 patients treated for an IP. Patients were grouped according to surgical approach, tumor presentation (primary, residual and recurrence) and Krouse-stage. Results: Recurrence was observed in 20.3%, 28.6% and 35.1% (p = 0.017) of the patients who underwent endoscopic, external and combined surgery, respectively. Recurrences occurred more often in residual than primary IP (36.9% vs. 22.3%, p = 0.021). Primary endoscopic surgery had a recurrence rate of 12.5%, which was comparable to the recent literature (11.2%, 161/1433). Conclusions: The relatively high number of recurrences in this cohort is explained by the long follow-up and previous (incomplete) surgery in 61.5% of the cases.

The key component, ammonium bicarbonate, allows a controlled, rapid release of doxorubicin to provide an effective drug concentration in the tumor microenvironment. An in vitro temperature-triggered drug release study showed that cumulative release improved more than two-fold. In addition, in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that local heat treatment or ultrasonic cavitation enhanced the therapeutic efficiency greatly.

On this work, the focus is on the shear stress forces induced by fluid flow. The study of flow-induced effects on cells leads to important advances in cardiovascular, cancer, stem cell, and bone biology understanding. These studies are performed using cell culture flow (CCF) systems, mainly parallel plate flow chambers (PPFC), and microfluidic systems. Here, it is proposed an original CCF system based on the open fluidics concept. The system is developed using a planar superhydrophobic platform with hydrophilic paths. The paths work as channels to drive cell culture medium flows without using walls for liquid confinement. The liquid streams are controlled just based on the wettability contrast. To validate the concept, the effect of the shear stress stimulus in the osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblast cells is studied. Combining bone morphogenic protein (specifically BMP-2) stimulation with this mechanical stimulus, a synergistic effect is found on osteoblast differentiation. This effect is confirmed by the enhancement of alkaline phosphatase activity, a well-known early marker of osteogenic differentiation.

The study was conducted in 2014 and 2016 on 148 female volunteers aged 57-88 from the Mazovian and Lublin province (Poland). Sample selection was targeted at elderly people with different body types. The exclusion criteria were: multi-organ failure, cancer and disability. Then among the subjects, a survey was conducted, that included demographic data, lifestyle, health status and vitamins and minerals supplements use. Food intake has been assessed using a 3-day dietary food records. The somatotype was determined using the RI with the Curtis key, classifying the subjects as ectomorphic (n=30), mesomorphic (n=31) and endomorphic (n=87). The somatotype was significantly related to place of residence, physical activity, waist and hip circumference, WHR and BMI index, total protein intake, animal protein intake, vitamin E intake (p≤0.05) and to fat, phosphorus and thiamine intake (p≤0.1).

Endomorphic subjects had significantly greater waist and hip circumference and diastolic blood pressure compared to the other somatotypes. The somatotype had only a significant effect on total protein, animal protein and vitamin E intake, and ectomorphic elderly women may be particularly susceptible to nutrient deficiencies. Due to the risk of macronutrient, vitamin and mineral deficiencies in the diets of the examined women, it seems necessary to educate this group as well as caregivers and doctors in the area of nutrition adapted to the needs of the elderly. © Anthropological Review 2017.","body physique; elderly women; nutrition",Article,Scopus

The modification presented includes the combination of this technique with cell-penetrating sequences. We propose to design cell-penetrating baits that can be incubated with living cells instead of cell lysates and therefore the interactions found will reflect those that occur within the intracellular context. Connexin43 (C×43), a protein that forms gap junction channels and hemichannels is down-regulated in high-grade gliomas. The C×43 region comprising amino acids 266-283 is responsible for the inhibition of the oncogenic activity of c-Src in glioma cells. Here we use TAT as the cell-penetrating sequence, biotin as the pull-down tag and the region of Cx43 comprised between amino acids 266-283 as the target to find intracellular interactions in the hard-to-transfect human glioma stem cells. One of the limitations of the proposed method is that the molecule used as bait could fail to fold properly and, consequently, the interactions found could not be associated with the effect. However, this method can be especially interesting for the interactions involved in signal transduction pathways because they are usually carried out by intrinsically disordered regions and, therefore, they do not require an ordered folding. In addition, one of the advantages of the proposed method is that the relevance of each residue on the interaction can be easily studied. This is a modular system; therefore, other cell-penetrating sequences, other tags, and other intracellular targets can be employed. Finally, the scope of this protocol is far beyond protein-protein interaction because this system can be applied to other bioactive cargoes such as RNA sequences, nanoparticles, viruses or any molecule that can be transduced with cell-penetrating sequences and fused to pull-down tags to study their intracellular mechanism of action. © 2017, Journal of Visualized Experiments.

These MMs fabricated by novel rotating membrane emulsification system with well-controlled sizes (100-1000 μm) exhibited extremely low hemolysis ratio and excellent biocompatibility with HepG2 cells and L02 cells. Moreover, experimental results demonstrated that, while exposed to alternating magnetic field (AMF) after TAE, the tumor edge could be heated up by more than 15 °C both in vivo and in vitro, whereas only a negligible increase of temperature was observed in the normal hepatic parenchyma (NHP) nearby. Sufficient temperature increase induces apoptosis of tumor cells. This can further inhibit the tumor angiogenesis and results in necrosis compared to the rabbits only treated with TAE. In stark contrast, tumors rapidly grow and subtotal metastasis occurs in the lungs or kidneys, causing severe complications for rabbits only irradiated under AMF. Importantly, the results from the biochemical examination and the gene expression of relative HCC markers further confirmed that the treatment protocol using PLGA-MMs could achieve good biosafety and excellent therapeutic efficacy, which are promising for liver cancer therapy. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","hepatocellular carcinoma; magnetic ablation; membrane emulsification; PLGA-magnetic microsphere; transcatheter arterial embolization",Article,Scopus

Both compounds went through an intersystem crossing (ISC) to form the triplet excited states T∗ and Tn∗ in acetonitrile but behave differently in neutral aqueous solutions, in which a triplet excited state proton transfer (ESPT) induced by the ISC process is also proposed for 2 but a singlet ESPT without ISC is proposed for 1, leading to the production of the triplet quinone methide (QM) and the singlet excited QM species respectively in these two systems. The triplet QM then underwent an ISC process to form an unstable ground state intermediate which soon returned to its starting material 2. However, the singlet excited state QM went through an internal conversion process to the ground state QM followed by the formation of its final product in an irreversible manner. These differences are thought to be derived from the slow vinyl C-C rotation and the moderate basicity of the vinyl C atom in 1 as compared with the fast C-O rotation and the greater basicity of the carbonyl O atom of 2 after photoexcitation. This can account for the experimental results in the literature that the aromatic vinyl compounds undergo efficient singlet excited state photochemical reactions while the aromatic carbonyl compounds prefer triplet photochemical reactions under aqueous conditions. These results have fundamental and significant implications for understanding of the ESPT reactivity in general, as well as for the design of molecules for efficient QM formation in aqueous media with potential applications in cancer phototherapy. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,Article,Scopus

This multistep strategy allows delivery of high doses of radiation to tumor cells while minimizing nonspecific normal tissue irradiation. In this study, we evaluated the potential of pretargeted α-particle radioimmunotherapy based on the inverse electron demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reaction between trans-cyclooctene (TCO) and tetrazine (Tz). Two tetrazine based chelators, DOTA-Tz and TCMC-Tz, were synthesized and compared for their radiolabeling efficiency with 212Pb, radiochemical stability, and in vivo pharmacokinetics. Dosimetry was determined from pretargeted biodistribution studies. The PRIT study was carried out in LS174T tumor bearing mice pretargeted with CC49-TCO mAb. After removing unbound mAbs from the blood using two doses of clearing agent, mice were treated with various doses of (0, 2.78, 4.63, 7.40, and 2 × 2.78 MBq) of 212Pb-DOTA-Tz. 212Pb-DOTA-Tz displayed better in vivo biodistribution than 212Pb-TCMC-Tz and was selected for PRIT study.

Methods Mammograms and clinical data of 171 patients with breast carcinoma confirmed by pathology were retrospectively analyzed, and all patients underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Then the patients were divided into axillary lymph node metastasis group and non-metastasis group according to the result of ALND. The texture features of these lesions were statistically analyzed, including gray-level histogram texture parameters (mean value, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis and variance) and gray-level co-occurrence matrix texture parameters (energy, entropy, correlation, inertia, inverse difference moment and contrast). Results In all of 171 breast cancer patients, 96 patients had axillary lymph node metastasis, while 75 patients had no metastasis. Mammograms showed negative axillary lymph nodes in 119 patients and positive axillary lymph nodes in 52 patients, and the sensitivity and specificity of mammograms in the diagnosis of positive axillary lymph nodes was 48.96% (47/96) and 93.33% (70/75), respectively. Mammogram texture analysis showed the values of energy, entropy, inverse difference moment and correlation in axillary lymph node metastasis group were higher than those in non-metastasis group, while the values of inertia and contrast in the axillary lymph node metastasis group were lower than those in non-metastasis group (all P<0.05). The rest texture parameters had no significant differences between two groups (all P>0.05). Area under curve (AUC) for texture parameters of energy, entropy, inertia, inverse difference moment, correlation and contrast was 0.610, 0.610, 0.374, 0.599, 0.612 and 0.421 (all P<0.05), respectively. AUC of mammography, mammogram texture features, and the combination of mammography and texture features was 0.711, 0.676 and 0.787 (all P<0.05), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of mammogram texture features, the combination of mammography and texture features in diagnosis of axillary lymph nodes metastasis was 62.5% and 64.6%, 66.7% and 82.7%, respectively. Conclusion Mammogram texture parameters are helpful for predicting axillary lymph node metastasis, and the combination of mammography and texture features can improve diagnostic efficiency of axillary lymph node metastasis.

Yet, in spite of 25 years of research, there are still no such shuttles available. To this end, we have designed magnetic and gold nanoparticles (NP)-embedded silica nanoshuttles (MGNSs) with nanopores on their surface. Fluorescently labeled Doxorubicin (DOX), a cancer drug, was loaded in the MGNSs as a payload. DOX loaded MGNSs were encapsulated in heat and pH sensitive polymer P(NIPAM-co-MAA) to enable controlled release of the payload. Magnetically-guided transport of MGNSs was examined in: (a) a glass capillary tube to simulate their delivery via blood vessels; and (b) porous hydrogels to simulate their transport in composite human tissues, including bone, cartilage, tendon, muscles and blood-brain barrier (BBB). The viscoelastic properties of hydrogels were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Cellular uptake of DOX-loaded MGNSs and the subsequent pH and temperature-mediated release were demonstrated in differentiated human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as well as epithelial HeLa cells. The presence of embedded iron and gold NPs in silica shells and polymer-coating are supported by SEM and TEM. Fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy documented DOX loading in the MGNSs. Time-dependent transport of MGNSs guided by an external magnetic field was observed in both glass capillary tubes and in the porous hydrogel. AFM results affirmed that the stiffness of the hydrogels model the rigidity range from soft tissues to bone. pH and temperature-dependent drug release analysis showed stimuli responsive and gradual drug release. Cells' viability MTT assays showed that MGNSs are non-toxic. The cell death from on-demand DOX release was observed in both neurons and epithelial cells even though the drug release efficiency was higher in neurons. Therefore, development of smart nanoshuttles have significant translational potential for controlled delivery of theranostics' payloads and precisely guided transport in specified tissues and organs (for example, bone, cartilage, tendon, bone marrow, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and brain) for highly efficient personalized medicine applications. © The Author(s) 2017.",,Article,Scopus

Many strategies developed to date lack chemo- and regioselectivity as well as result in non-native linkages that may suffer from instability in vivo and adversely affect the protein's structure and function. We describe here the reaction of N-nucleophiles with the amino acid dehydroalanine (Dha) in a protein context. When Dha is chemically installed in proteins, the addition of a wide-range N-nucleophiles enables the rapid formation of amine linkages (secondary and tertiary) in a chemoselective manner under mild, biocompatible conditions. These new linkages are stable at a wide range of pH values (pH 2.8 to 12.8), under reducing conditions (biological thiols such as glutathione) and in human plasma. This method is demonstrated for three proteins and is shown to be fully compatible with disulfide bridges, as evidenced by the selective modification of recombinant albumin that displays 17 structurally relevant disulfides. The practicability and utility of our approach is further demonstrated by the construction of a chemically modified C2A domain of Synaptotagmin-I protein that retains its ability to preferentially bind to apoptotic cells at a level comparable to the native protein. Importantly, the method was useful for building a homogeneous antibody-drug conjugate with a precise drug-to-antibody ratio of 2. The kinase inhibitor crizotinib was directly conjugated to Dha through its piperidine motif, and its antibody-mediated intracellular delivery results in 10-fold improvement of its cancer cell-killing efficacy. The simplicity and exquisite site-selectivity of the aza-Michael ligation described herein allows the construction of stable secondary and tertiary amine-linked protein conjugates without affecting the structure and function of biologically relevant proteins. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,Article,Scopus

Results were compared to 17β-estradiol (E 2 ) treatment. Methods: A total of 70 female ICR strain mice (7weeks) were randomly divided into 10 groups with 7 mice in each group as follows: (1) sham-operated control mice (sham) received daily oral phosphate-buffered-saline (PBS) of equal volumes through oral administration. (2) OVX mice received a daily oral administration of PBS (OVX). (3) OVX mice treated daily with 50mg/kg b.w./ day of SME (4) with 100mg/kg b.w./day of SME or (5) with 200mg/kg b.w./day of SME via oral administration. (6) OVX mice treated daily with 50mg/kg b.w./day of SML (7) with 100mg/kg b.w./day of SML or (8) with 200mg/kg b.w./day of SML via oral administration. (9) OVX mice treated daily with 10ml/kg b.w./day of LCa (10) OVX mice received i.p. injections of 17β-estradiol (E 2 ) (0.1mg/kg b.w./day) three times per week for 12weeks. Results: micro-CT analysis revealed that oral administration of SML inhibited tibial bone loss, sustained trabecular bone state, and ameliorated bone biochemical markers. In addition, SML administration compared to SEM and LCa reduced serum levels of RANKL, osteocalcin and BALP through increased serum levels of OPG and E 2 in OVX mice. SML also had more beneficial effects on protection of estrogen-dependent bone loss through blocking expression of TRAF6 and NFTAc1 and produces cathepsin K and calcitonin receptor to develop osteoclast differentiation. Conclusion: These data suggest that S. miltiorrhiza Bunge combined with liquefied calcium supplement has an inhibitory activity in OVX mice.

In this paper, the segmentation of lung image is proposed. Cancer segmentation will process the lung CT-Scan as an image input with watershed process to cut off cavity area. The result will be processed by color histogram calculation to obtain mean and standard deviation value. This value is useful for evaluate non-cancer area and produce cancer image. Segmentation process will be followed by measurement of cancer and cavity area. The overall output is percentage between the large of cancer area and cavity area.

Methods: The Lund Childhood Cancer Genetic study includes newly diagnosed childhood cancer patients as well as childhood cancer survivors visiting the Department of Pediatrics or the Late Effect Clinic at Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. Questionnaires regarding family history of cancer and blood samples were provided. Reported data were validated and extended by use of the Swedish Population- and Cancer Registries. Demographics in families with one case of childhood cancer (FAM1) were investigated and compared to families with multiple cases of childhood cancer (FAM > 1) as well as to childhood cancer in the general population. Results: Forty-one out of 528 families (7.8%) had more than one case of childhood cancer. In 23 families the affected children were relatives up to a 3rd degree (4.4%). In FAM > 1, 69.2% of the children with leukemia and 60% of those with tumors in the central nervous system (CNS) had a childhood relative with matching diagnosis, both significantly higher than expected. Significantly more female than male patients were observed in FAM > 1 compared to FAM1. This female predominance was most striking in childhood leukemia (77% female) and also, yet to a lesser extent, in CNS tumors (68% female). Conclusions: We conclude that the high proportion of children with leukemia or CNS tumors in FAM > 1 having a childhood relative with the same diagnosis suggests a hereditary background. Moreover, we report a female predominance in childhood leukemia and childhood CNS tumors in FAM > 1, which may indicate a hereditary gender-specific risk factor in these families. © 2017 The Author(s).","Familial cancer predisposition; Genetic cancer susceptibility; Hereditary cancer syndrome; Pediatric cancer",Article,Scopus

This research paper explains the detection process of the Cancer Antigens-CA 125 from a micro volume of the biofluid sample. The biochip is incorporated with the sensing platform in a microfluidic channel to detect the cancer antigens during the biofluid flow in the microchannel. The sensing platform is designed with multiple layers, in order to enhance the antibody immobilization on nano circuit and thus the detection signal. The antigen-antibody interaction during the biofluid flow on the immobilized antibodies in the microchannel change the capacitance measurements in the sensing circuit. The change in the capacitance indicates the targeted cancer antigens concentration in the biofluid sample. The concentration of CA-125 antigens used in the experiment is 55ug/ml at a pH of 7.4, in order to establish the functionality of the biochip. The change in capacitance after the antigen-antibody interaction is 679.62 pF is when compared to the bare electrodes. The In-situ realtime measurement of cancer biomarkers from a finger prick blood sample in a simple and easy way using the micro biochip helps to monitor the cancer progression more easily and thus enable the enhanced cancer management. © 2017 IEEE.","biochip; cancer diagnosis; cancer monitoring; nano circuit with capacitive sensing; point-of-care (POC)",Conference Paper,Scopus

We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of second cancers associated with receipt of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, trial registers, conference proceedings, review articles, and reference lists of trial publications for all relevant RCTs comparing cisplatin- versus non-cisplatin-containing chemotherapy with data on second cancers. We extracted data about study characteristics and second cancers, especially leukemia/ myelodysplasia. The primary and secondary outcomes were the odds ratios (ORs) for all second cancers and for secondary leukemia/ myelodysplasia, respectively. Results: We identified 28 eligible trials with 7403 patients. Second cancers were reported in 143 patients, including 75 patients in the cisplatin arm and 68 in the non-cisplatin arm (raw event rates of 1.91 and 1.96%, respectively). The pooled OR for risk of all second cancers associated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy was 0.95 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.67-1.33, P = 0.76). Secondary leukemia/ myelodysplasia was reported in 14 patients on cisplatin arms and in 6 patients on non-cisplatin arms of 11 eligible RCTs with 2629 patients (raw event rates of 1.09 and 0.45%, respectively; pooled OR = 2.34, 95%CI 0.97-5.65, P = 0.06). Conclusion: Cisplatin was not associated with a significantly increased risk of second cancers compared with non-cisplatin-based chemotherapy. There is a non-significant trend to increased risk of leukemia/ myelodysplasia and the absolute risk was low. The concern about risk of second cancers should not influence decisions to use an efficacious regimen containing cisplatin. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cisplatin; Randomized controlled trials; Second cancer",Article,Scopus

The evidence for a relationship with cancer risk, however, is not entirely consistent. This study aims to assess the relationships of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein (a) (apo(a)), apoB-100, and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) with risk of common cancer forms and total cancer mortality in comparison to incidence and mortality of CVD. Methods: We selected a case-cohort sample out of the prospective EPIC-Heidelberg study, including a random subcohort (n = 2739), and cases of cancer (n = 1632), cancer mortality (n = 761), CVD (n = 1070), and CVD mortality (n = 381). Concentrations of lipid biomarkers were measured in pre-diagnostic blood samples. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Prentice-weighted Cox regression models. Results: High levels of circulating apoB-100 and TG were inversely associated and high HDL-C levels were positively associated with breast cancer risk (highest vs. lowest quartile (Q4 vs. Q1), HRapoB 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.98; HRTG 0.65, 0.46-0.92; and HRHDL 1.39, 1.01-1.93). Higher levels of Lp(a) were associated with an increase in prostate cancer risk (Q4 vs. Q1, HRLp(a) 1.43, 1.02-2.03) and high levels of apo(a) were associated with a decrease in lung cancer risk (Q4 vs. Q1, HRapo(a) 0.52, 0.30-0.91). High TC, HDL-C, apo(a), and Lp(a) levels were associated with a reduction in total cancer mortality (Q4 vs. Q1, HRTC 0.71, 0.54-0.94; HRHDL 0.67, 0.50-0.91; HRapo(a) 0.71, 0.54-0.93; and HRLp(a) 0.74, 0.57-0.98). All lipid biomarkers were associated with risk of myocardial infarction, whereby TC, apoB-100, TG, and Lp(a) were positively and HLD-C and apo(a) inversely associated with risk. Only high levels of TG were associated with an increased risk of stroke. None of the lipids were associated with risk of colorectal cancer and with risk of CVD mortality after multivariable adjustments. Conclusions: This prospective study demonstrates inverse associations of lipid biomarkers with cancer incidence and mortality, with the exception of positive associations of HDL-C and Lp(a) with breast and prostate cancer risk, respectively. Thus, the observed cancer risk pattern clearly differs from the CVD risk pattern. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cancer; Cholesterol; EPIC-Heidelberg; Lipids; Lipoprotein; Mortality",Article,Scopus

Several hundred candidate peptides were identified through this method, providing challenges for choosing and validating the small number of peptides that might prove diagnostically useful. To accomplish this validation, we used 2D chromatography coupled with SRM of candidate peptides. We applied this approach, called sequential analysis of fractionated eluates by SRM (SAFE-SRM), to plasma from cancer patients and discovered two peptides encoded by the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (PPIA) gene whose abundance was increased in the plasma of ovarian cancer patients. At optimal thresholds, elevated levels of at least one of these two peptides was detected in 43 (68.3%) of 63 women with ovarian cancer but in none of 50 healthy controls. In addition to providing a potential biomarker for ovarian cancer, this approach is generally applicable to the discovery of peptides characteristic of various disease states.","Cancer diagnostics; Clinical proteomics; Peptide biomarker; Plasma biomarker; Selected reaction monitoring",Article,Scopus

Recent studies have provided strong support for the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis, which suggests that many cancers, including breast cancer, are driven by a subpopulation of cells that display stem cell-like properties. The hypothesis that a subpopulation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) possesses many CSC-like hallmarks is reinforced by the expression of related molecular markers between these two cell populations. The aim of this study is to systematically review primary studies and identify circulating CSC markers in breast cancer patients. Methods and design: Relevant observational studies evaluating the expression of circulating breast cancer stem cell markers through October 31, 2016, will be searched in PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and Google Scholar with no restriction on language. Full copies of articles identified by the search and considered to meet the inclusion criteria will be obtained for data extraction and synthesis. Two quality assessment tools will be used for evaluating observational studies like case control, which are the Hoy et al. suggested tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), respectively. Publication bias will be assessed by funnel plots or Egger's test (i.e., plots of study results against precision), and data synthesis will be performed using Stata software (Stata Corp V.12, TX, USA).This systematic review will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Discussion: Detecting cancer stem cells in blood will help clinicians to monitor cancer patients by obtaining as many samples as needed with a non-invasive method and in any stages; it is not possible to repeat sampling on working on tissue samples. By identifying cancer stem cells early in blood, it will be possible to distinguish metastasis in early stages.

It is computed from the image datasets, which are manually prepared in small cropped image with 3 window sizes including 128×128 pixels, 192×192 pixels and 256×256 pixels. The results show that the boosting ensemble classifier gives the best accuracy about 80% from window size of 256, although it is the lowest when using the single DT as classifier. The results indicated that the ensemble method is capable of improving the accuracy in the classification compared to the single classifier. The classification model using FD and the ensemble classifier would be applied to develop the computer-aided systems for breast cancer diagnosis in the future. © 2017 IEEE.","Bagging; boosting; decision tree; feature extraction; image pattern recognition",Conference Paper,Scopus

Identification of factors critical for BCSC function is therefore vital for the development of therapies. Here, we identify the arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 as a key in vitro and in vivo regulator of BCSC proliferation and self-renewal and establish FOXP1, a winged helix/forkhead transcription factor, as a critical effector of PRMT5-induced BCSC function. Mechanistically, PRMT5 recruitment to the FOXP1 promoter facilitates H3R2me2s, SET1 recruitment, H3K4me3, and gene expression. Our findings are clinically significant, as PRMT5 depletion within established tumor xenografts or treatment of patient-derived BCSCs with a pre-clinical PRMT5 inhibitor substantially reduces BCSC numbers. Together, our findings highlight the importance of PRMT5 in BCSC maintenance and suggest that small-molecule inhibitors of PRMT5 or downstream targets could be an effective strategy eliminating this cancer-causing population. Chiang et al. show that the arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 contributes to breast cancer stem cell function, in part through histone methylation regulating FOXP1 expression. Targeting of PRMT5 through depletion or inhibition reduces stem cell frequency in vitro and in vivo, implicating PRMT5 as important in breast cancer pathogenesis. © 2017 The Authors","arginine methylation; breast cancer; breast cancer stem cell; drug resistance; epigenetics; FOXP1; H3R2me2s; histone methylation; PRMT5; self-renewal",Article,Scopus

Initially, neoantigens were not recognized as preferred targets for cancer immunotherapy due to their enormous diversity and the therefore limited options to develop ""one fits all"" pharmacologic solutions. In recent years, the experience obtained in clinical trials demonstrating a predictive role of neoantigens in checkpoint inhibition has changed our view on the clinical potential of neoantigens in cancer immunotherapy. Technological advances such as sequencing of whole cancer genomes, the development of reliable algorithms for epitope prediction, and an increasing number of immunotherapeutic options now facilitate the development of personalized tumor therapies directly targeting a patient's neoantigenic burden. Preclinical studies in mice that support the excellent therapeutic potential of neoantigen-directed immunotherapies have provided blueprints on how this methodology can be translated into clinical applications in humans. Consistently, very recent clinical studies on personalized vaccinations targeting in silico predicted neoepitopes shed a first light on the therapeutic potential of personalized, neoantigen-directed immunotherapies. In our review, we discuss the various subtypes of tumor antigens with a focus on neoantigens and their potential in cancer immunotherapy. We will describe the current methods and techniques of detection as well as the structural requirements for neoantigens that are needed for their recognition by T cells and for tumor destruction. To assess the clinical potential of neoantigens, we will discuss their occurrence and functional relevance in spontaneous and hereditary cancers and their prognostic and predictive value. We will present in detail the existing immunotherapeutic options that exploit the neoantigen burden of tumors encompassing both preclinical efforts that provided convincing technological proof-of-concept and the current clinical studies confirming the potential of neoantigen-directed immunotherapies. © 2017 Wirth and Kühnel.","Adoptive transfer; Mutations; Neoantigens; Personalized cancer immunotherapy; Vaccination",Review,Scopus

Aberrant DNA methylation patterns, including global hypomethylation and regional hypermethylation, are associated with cancer and implicated in oncogenic events. How DNA methylation is regulated in developmental and cellular processes and dysregulated in cancer is poorly understood. Here, we show that PRMT6, a protein arginine methyltransferase responsible for asymmetric dimethylation of histone H3 arginine 2 (H3R2me2a), negatively regulates DNA methylation and that PRMT6 upregulation contributes to global DNA hypomethylation in cancer. Mechanistically, PRMT6 overexpression impairs chromatin association of UHRF1, an accessory factor of DNMT1, resulting in passive DNA demethylation. The effect is likely due to elevated H3R2me2a, which inhibits the interaction between UHRF1 and histone H3. Our work identifies a mechanistic link between protein arginine methylation and DNA methylation, which is disrupted in cancer. Veland et al. find that PRMT6, an arginine methyltransferase responsible for histone H3 arginine 2 (H3R2) methylation, negatively regulates maintenance DNA methylation by impairing UHRF1 recruitment to chromatin.

Here, we observe that the splicing factor SRSF1 regulates DBF4B exon6 splicing by specifically binding and promoting its inclusion. Knockdown of the exon6-containing isoform (DBF4B-FL) significantly inhibits the tumorigenic potential of colon cancer cells in vitro and in mice, and SRSF1 inactivation phenocopies DBF4B-FL depletion. DBF4B-FL and SRSF1 are required for cancer cell proliferation and for the maintenance of genomic stability. Overexpression of DBF4B-FL can protect against DNA damage induced by SRSF1 knockdown and rescues growth defects in SRSF1-depleted cells. Increased DBF4B exon6 inclusion parallels SRSF1 upregulation in clinical colorectal cancer samples. Taken together, our findings identify SRSF1 as a key regulator of DBF4B pre-mRNA splicing dysregulation in colon cancer, with possible clinical implications as candidate prognostic factors in cancer patients.

Such events occur mainly in retrovirus infection but also sometimes in DNA and non-retroviral RNA virus infections. If viral sequences are integrated into the genomes of germ line cells, the sequences can become inherited as endogenous viral elements (EVEs). The integration events of viral sequences may have oncogenic potential. Because proviral integrations of some retroviruses and/or reactivation of endogenous retroviruses are closely linked to cancers, viral insertions related to non-retroviral viruses also possibly contribute to cancer development. This article focuses on genomic viral sequences derived from two non-retroviral viruses, whose endogenization is already reported, and discusses their possible contributions to cancer. Viral insertions of hepatitis B virus play roles in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Endogenous bornavirus-like elements, the only non-retroviral RNA virus-related EVEs found in the human genome, may also be involved in cancer formation. In addition, the possible contribution of the interactions between viruses and retrotransposons, which seem to be a major driving force for generating EVEs related to non-retroviral RNA viruses, to cancers will be discussed. Future studies regarding the possible links described here may open a new avenue for the development of novel therapeutics for tumor virus-related cancers and/or provide novel insights into EVE functions. © 2017 Honda.","Borna disease virus; Cancer; Endogenous viral elements; Hepatitis B virus; LINE-1; Non-coding RNAs; Retrotransposon",Short Survey,Scopus

These modalities use light e.g., laser irradiation in an extracorporeal or intravenous mode to activate photosensitizer agents with selectivity in the target tissue. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a minimally invasive technique for cancer treatment which uses laser-activated photoabsorbers to convert photon energy into heat sufficient to induce cells destruction via apoptosis, necroptosis and/or necrosis. During the last decade, PTT has attracted an increased interest since the therapy can be combined with customized functionalized nanoparticles (NPs). Recent advances in nanotechnology have given rise to generation of various types of NPs, like gold NPs (AuNPs), designed to act both as radiosensitizers and photothermal sensitizing agents due to their unique optical and electrical properties i.e., functioning in dual mode. Functionalized AuNPS can be employed in combination with non-ionizing and ionizing radiation to significantly improve the efficacy of cancer treatment while at the same time sparing normal tissues. Here, we first provide an overview of the use of NPs for cancer therapy. Then we review many recent advances on the use of gold NPs in PTT, RT and PTT/RT based on different types of AuNPs, irradiation conditions and protocols. We refer to the interaction mechanisms of AuNPs with cancer cells via the effects of non-ionizing and ionizing radiations and we provide recent existing experimental data as a baseline for the design of optimized protocols in PTT, RT and PTT/RT combined treatment. © 2017 by the authors.

Moreover, chemotherapy only produces 20-30% pathologic complete response. Because miRNAs are frequently dysregulated in breast cancer and have broad tissue effects, individual or combinations of circulating miRNAs may serve as ideal diagnostic, predictive or prognostic biomarkers, as well as therapeutic targets. Understanding the role and mechanism of dysregulated miRNAs in TNBC may help to develop novel diagnostic and prognostic strategy for TNBC patients. Methods: The miRNA array profiles of 1299 breast cancer patients were collected from the Metabric database and subjected to analysis of the altered miRNAs between TNBC and non-TNBC. In Student's t-test and Kaplan-Meier analysis, four upregulated miRNAs correlated with poor survival in TNBC but not in non-TNBC. Four miRNAs were manipulated in multiple cell lines to investigate their functional role in carcinogenesis. From these results, we studied miR-105 and miR-93-3p in greater detail. The level of miR-105 and miR-93-3p were evaluated in 25 breast cancer tumor tissues. In addition, the diagnostic utility of circulating miR-105 and miR-93-3p were examined in 12 normal and 118 breast cancer plasma samples by ROC curve construction. Results: miR-105 and miR-93-3p were upregulated and correlated with poor survival in TNBC patients. Both miR-105 and miR-93-3p were found to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling by downregulation of SFPR1. By this action, stemness, chemoresistance, and metastasis were promoted. Importantly, thecombination of circulating miR-105/93-3p may serve as a powerful biomarker for TNBC, even in early-stage disease. Conclusions: miR-105/93-3p activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling by downregulating SFRP1 and thereby promotes stemness, chemoresistance, and metastasis in TNBC cells. Most importantly, combined circulating miR-105/93-3p levels represent a prime candidate for development into a diagnostic biomarker for both early- and late-stage TNBC. © 2017 The Author(s).","Biomarker; Cisplatin; Drug resistance; MiR-105; MiR-93-3p; Triple negative breast cancer",Article,Scopus

These organs provide a setting for interactions between antigen-specific lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells recruited from local infected or inflamed tissues. Secondary lymphoid organs develop as a part of a genetically preprogrammed process during embryogenesis. However, organogenesis of secondary lymphoid tissues can also be recapitulated in adulthood during de novo lymphoid neogenesis of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). These ectopic lymphoid-like structures form in the inflamed tissues afflicted by various pathological conditions, including cancer, autoimmunity, infection, or allograft rejection. Studies are beginning to shed light on the function of such structures in different disease settings, raising important questions regarding their contribution to progression or resolution of disease. Data show an association between the tumor-associated TLSs and a favorable prognosis in various types of human cancer, attracting the speculation that TLSs support effective local antitumor immune responses. However, definitive evidence for the role for TLSs in fostering immune responses in vivo are lacking, with current data remaining largely correlative by nature. In fact, some more recent studies have even demonstrated an immunosuppressive, tumor-promoting role for cancer-associated TLSs. In this review, we will discuss what is known about the development of cancer-associated TLSs and the current understanding of their potential role in the antitumor immune response. © 2017 Colbeck, Ager, Gallimore and Jones.","Cancer immunotherapy; High endothelial venules; Lymphoid neogenesis; Tertiary lymphoid structures; Tumor microenvironment",Review,Scopus

Objective: To identify novel protein biomarkers in stool that outperform or complement hemoglobin in detecting CRC and advanced adenomas. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Colonoscopy-controlled referral population from several centers. Participants: 315 stool samples from one series of 12 patients with CRC and 10 persons without colorectal neoplasia (control samples) and a second series of 81 patients with CRC, 40 with advanced adenomas, and 43 with nonadvanced adenomas, as well as 129 persons without colorectal neoplasia (control samples); 72 FIT samples from a third independent series of 14 patients with CRC, 16 with advanced adenomas, and 18 with nonadvanced adenomas, as well as 24 persons without colorectal neoplasia (control samples). Measurements: Stool samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis and logistic regression analyses were performed to identify protein combinations that differentiated CRC or advanced adenoma from control samples. Antibody-based assays for 4 selected proteins were done on FIT samples. Results: In total, 834 human proteins were identified, 29 of which were statistically significantly enriched in CRC versus control stool samples in both series. Combinations of 4 proteins reached sensitivities of 80% and 45% for detecting CRC and advanced adenomas, respectively, at 95% specificity, which was higher than that of hemoglobin alone (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003, respectively). Selected proteins could be measured in small sample volumes used in FIT-based screening programs and discriminated between CRC and control samples (P < 0.001). Limitation: Lack of availability of antibodies prohibited validation of the top protein combinations in FIT samples. Conclusion: Mass spectrometry of stool samples identified novel candidate protein biomarkers for CRC screening. Several protein combinations outperformed hemoglobin in discriminating CRC or advanced adenoma from control samples.

In general, benign nodules hold quite smooth margins whilst malignant ones hold irregular margins. The main objective of this research is to classify different margin types of pulmonary nodules by observing the 3D structure. Nodule candidates from 2D lung CT slices are segmented firstly and then stacked to form a 3D image. Geometric features of the 3D nodule are extracted and fed into the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to classify the margin types.

Evidence is emerging suggesting tumour association with alterations in adipose tissue, but much less is known about drug-related mechanisms contributing to adipose atrophy. Identification of mechanisms by which tumour and cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, affect adipose tissue are required to develop appropriate therapeutic interventions to prevent fat depletion in cancer. This pre-clinical study aimed to assess alterations in adipose tissue during the clinical course of cancer. Methods: Fischer 344 rats bearing the Ward colorectal tumour were euthanized before chemotherapy, after 1- cycle, or 2-cycles of a combination chemotherapy consisting of Irinotecan (CPT-11) combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which recapitulates first line treatment for human colorectal cancer. Periuterine adipose tissue was isolated. Healthy rats served as a reference group. Histological analysis (hematoxylin and eosin), Real-time PCR (TaqMan) and proteomic analysis (LC-MS/MS) were performed. Results: Larger adipocytes (3993.7 ± 52.6 μm2) in tumour-bearing animals compared to the reference group (3227.7 ± 36.7 μm2; p &lt; 0.001) was associated with reduced expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The presence of a tumour has a significant effect on phospholipid but not triglyceride fatty acid composition. There were greater proportions of saturated fatty acids concurrent with lower monounsaturated fatty acids within the PL fraction of adipocytes in tumour-bearing animals. Chemotherapy treatment decreased the size of adipocytes (2243.9 ± 30.4 μm2; p &lt; 0.001) and led to depletion of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in adipose tissue triglyceride. Evaluation of the proteome profile revealed decreased expression of proteins involved in ATP generation, β-oxidation, and lipogenesis. Overall, adipose tissue may not be able to efficiently oxidize fatty acids to provide energy to maintain energy demanding pathways like lipogenesis inside the tissue. Conclusions: In conclusion, metabolic adaptations to mitochondrial impairment may contribute to diminished lipid storage capacity of adipose tissue following chemotherapy delivery. © 2017 The Author(s).","Adipose atrophy; Cancer treatment; Fatty acids; Lipid synthetic pathways; Lipogenesis",Article,Scopus

Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of Kras mutant cancer recapitulate critical aspects of this disease and are widely used for preclinical validation of targets and therapies. Through comprehensive profiling of exomes and matched transcriptomes of >200 KrasG12D-initiated GEMM tumors from one lung and two pancreatic cancer models, we discover that significant intratumoral and intertumoral genomic heterogeneity evolves during tumorigenesis. Known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, beyond those engineered, are mutated, amplified, and deleted. Unlike human tumors, the GEMM genomic landscapes are dominated by copy number alterations, while protein-altering mutations are rare. However, interspecies comparative analyses of the genomic landscapes demonstrate fidelity between genes altered in KRAS mutant human and murine tumors. Genes that are spontaneously altered during murine tumorigenesis are also among the most prevalent found in human indications. Using targeted therapies, we also demonstrate that this inherent tumor heterogeneity can be exploited preclinically to discover cancer-specific and genotype-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. Focusing on Kras allelic imbalance, a feature shared by all three models, we discover that MAPK pathway inhibition impinges uniquely on this event, indicating distinct susceptibility and fitness advantage of Kras-mutant cells. These data reveal previously unknown genomic diversity among KrasG12D-initiated GEMM tumors, places them in context of human patients, and demonstrates how to exploit this inherent tumor heterogeneity to discover therapeutic vulnerabilities.","Cancer; Genomics; Heterogeneity; Kras; Mouse models",Article,Scopus

Lipid droplet (LD) accumulation is a hallmark of hypoxic cancer cells, yet how LDs form and function during hypoxia remains poorly understood. Herein, we report that in various cancer cells upon oxygen deprivation, HIF-1 activation down-modulates LD catabolism mediated by adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the key enzyme for intracellular lipolysis. Proteomics and functional analyses identified hypoxia-inducible gene 2 (HIG2), a HIF-1 target, as a new inhibitor of ATGL. Knockout of HIG2 enhanced LD breakdown and fatty acid (FA) oxidation, leading to increased ROS production and apoptosis in hypoxic cancer cells as well as impaired growth of tumor xenografts. All of these effects were reversed by co-ablation of ATGL. Thus, by inhibiting ATGL, HIG2 acts downstream of HIF-1 to sequester FAs in LDs away from the mitochondrial pathways for oxidation and ROS generation, thereby sustaining cancer cell survival in hypoxia. © Molaro and Malik.",,Article,Scopus

Two cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7), were selected as breast cancer cells, with two kinds of membrane protein, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), observed in both cells. The membrane proteins are surface markers used to differentiate and classify breast cancer cells. EGFR and EpCAM were detected with Alexa Fluor® 488-labeled anti-EGFR antibody (488-EGFR) and allophycocyanin (APC)-labeled anti-EpCAM antibody (APC-EpCAM), respectively. In MDA-MB231 cells, three-fold plus or minus one and seven-fold plus or minus two brighter fluorescence of 488-EGFR were observed on the 480-nm pitch and the 400-nm pitch compared with that on a glass slide. Results show the 400-nm pitch is useful. Dual-color fluorescence of 488-EGFR and APC-EpCAM in MDA-MB231 was clearly observed with seven-fold plus or minus two and nine-fold plus or minus three, respectively, on the 400-nm pitch pattern of a plasmonic chip. Therefore, the 400-nm pitch contributed to the dual-color fluorescence enhancement for these wavelengths. An optimal grating pitch of a plasmonic chip improved a fluorescence image of membrane proteins with the help of the surface plasmon-enhanced field. © 2017 by the authors.

Alternatively, cysteine can be obtained through uptake of its oxidized form, cystine. Many cancer cells exhibit methionine dependency such that their proliferation is impaired in growth media in which methionine is replaced by homocysteine. We showed that oncogenic PIK3CA and decreased expression of SLC7A11, a gene that encodes a cystine transporter also known as xCT, correlated with increased methionine dependency in breast cancer cells. Oncogenic PIK3CA was sufficient to confer methionine dependency to mammary epithelial cells, partly by decreasing cystine uptake through the transcriptional and posttranslational inhibition of xCT. Manipulation of xCT activity altered the proliferation of breast cancer cells in methionine-deficient, homocysteine-containing media, suggesting that it functionally contributed to methionine dependency. We propose that concurrent with decreased cystine uptake through xCT, PIK3CA mutant cells use homocysteine through the transsulfuration pathway to synthesize cysteine. Consequently, less homocysteine is available to produce methionine, contributing to methionine dependency. These results indicate that oncogenic PIK3CA alters methionine and cysteine utilization, partly by inhibiting xCT to contribute to the methionine dependency phenotype in breast cancer cells.

Osteolytic bone metastases are common in advanced breast cancer and are a major contributor to decreased survival, performance, and quality of life for patients. Pathologic fracture caused by osteolytic cancer in bone (OCIB) leads to a significant (32%) increased risk of death compared to patients without fracture. Since muscle weakness is linked to risk of falls which are a major cause of fracture, we have investigated skeletal muscle response to OCIB. Here, we show that a syngeneic mouse model of OCIB (4T1 mammary tumor cells) leads to cachexia and skeletal muscle weakness associated with oxidation of the ryanodine receptor and calcium (Ca2+) release channel (RyR1). Muscle atrophy follows known pathways via both myostatin signaling and expression of muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases, atrogin-1 and MuRF1. We have identified a mechanism for skeletal muscle weakness due to increased oxidative stress on RyR1 via NAPDH oxidases [NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) and NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4)]. In addition, SMAD3 phosphorylation is higher in muscle from tumor-bearing mice, a critical step in the intracellular signaling pathway that transmits TGFβ signaling to the nucleus. This is the first time that skeletal muscle weakness has been described in a syngeneic model of OCIB and represents a unique model system in which to study cachexia and changes in skeletal muscle. © 2017 Regan, Mikesell, Reiken, Xu, Marks, Mohammad, Guise and Waning.","Breast cancer; Immune competent; Muscle weakness; Osteolytic disease; Syngeneic tumor model",Article,Scopus

Expression of the enzyme arginase 1 (Arg1) is a defining feature of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and leads to depletion of L-arginine, a nutrient required for T cell and natural killer (NK) cell proliferation. Here we use CB-1158, a potent and orally-bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of arginase, to investigate the role of Arg1 in regulating anti-tumor immunity. Methods: CB-1158 was tested for the ability to block myeloid cell-mediated inhibition of T cell proliferation in vitro, and for tumor growth inhibition in syngeneic mouse models of cancer as a single agent and in combination with other therapies. Tumors from animals treated with CB-1158 were profiled for changes in immune cell subsets, expression of immune-related genes, and cytokines. Human tumor tissue microarrays were probed for Arg1 expression by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Cancer patient plasma samples were assessed for Arg1 protein and L-arginine by ELISA and mass spectrometry, respectively. Results: CB-1158 blocked myeloid cell-mediated suppression of T cell proliferation in vitro and reduced tumor growth in multiple mouse models of cancer, as a single agent and in combination with checkpoint blockade, adoptive T cell therapy, adoptive NK cell therapy, and the chemotherapy agent gemcitabine. Profiling of the tumor microenvironment revealed that CB-1158 increased tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and NK cells, inflammatory cytokines, and expression of interferon-inducible genes. Patient tumor samples from multiple histologies expressed an abundance of tumor-infiltrating Arg1+ myeloid cells. Plasma samples from cancer patients exhibited elevated Arg1 and reduced L-arginine compared to healthy volunteers. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that Arg1 is a key mediator of immune suppression and that inhibiting Arg1 with CB-1158 shifts the immune landscape toward a pro-inflammatory environment, blunting myeloid cell-mediated immune evasion and reducing tumor growth. Furthermore, our results suggest that arginase blockade by CB-1158 may be an effective therapy in multiple types of cancer and combining CB-1158 with standard-of-care chemotherapy or other immunotherapies may yield improved clinical responses. © 2017 The Author(s).","Arg1; Arg2; Arginase; Arginine; Checkpoint blockade; Granulocyte; Immunotherapy; Myeloid derived suppressor cell; Tumor associated macrophage; Tumor microenvironment",Article,Scopus

Study therapy included two cycles of docetaxel 75mg/m2 on days 1 and 29 to treat the tumor, release hidden antigens and produce lymphopenia. DRibbles were to be administered intradermally on days 14, 43, 57, 71, and 85, together with GM-CSF (50 μg/d x 6d, administered via SQ mini pump).

In this study, we reveal important resistance mechanisms and photochemical strategies to overcome 5-FU resistance in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Methods: 5-FU resistant (5-FUR), epithelial-to-mesenchymal-like sub-clones of the wild type pancreatic cancer cell line Panc03.27 were previously generated in our lab. We investigated the cytotoxic effect of the endosomal/lysosomal-localizing photosensitizer TPCS2a (fimaporfin) combined with light (photochemical treatment, PCT) using MTS viability assay, and used fluorescence microscopy to show localization of TPCS2a and to investigate the effect of photodamage of lysosomes. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to investigate uptake of photosensitizer and to assess intracellular ROS levels. Expression and localization of LAMP1 was assessed using RT-qPCR, western blotting, and structured illumination microscopy. MTS viability assay was used to assess the effect of combinations of 5-FU, chloroquine (CQ), and photochemical treatment. Expression of CD105 was investigated using RT-qPCR, western blotting, flow cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy, and co-localization of TPCS2a and anti-CD105-saporin was assessed using microscopy. Lastly, the MTS assay was used to investigate cytotoxic effects of photochemical internalization (PCI) of the anti-CD105-immunotoxin. Results: The 5-FUR cell lines display hypersensitivity to PCT, which was linked to increased uptake of TPCS2a, altered lysosomal distribution, lysosomal photodamage and increased expression of the lysosomal marker LAMP-1 in the 5-FUR cells. We show that inhibition of autophagy induced by either chloroquine or lysosomal photodamage increases the sensitivity to 5-FU in the resistant cells. The three 5-FUR sub-clones overexpress Endoglin (CD105). Treatment with the immunotoxin anti-CD105-saporin alone significantly reduced the viability of the CD105-expressing 5-FUR cells, whereas little effect was seen in the CD105-negative non-resistant parental cancer cell lines. Strikingly, using the intracellular drug delivery method photochemical internalization (PCI) by combining light-controlled activation of the TPCS2a with nanomolar levels of CD105-saporin resulted in strong cytotoxic effects in the 5-FUR cell population. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that autophagy is an important resistance mechanism against the chemotherapeutic drug 5-FU in pancreatic cancer cells, and that inhibition of the autophagy process, either by CQ or lysosomal photodamage, can contribute to increased sensitivity to 5-FU. For the first time, we demonstrate the promise of PCI-based targeting of CD105 in site-specific elimination of 5-FU resistant pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. In conclusion, PCI-based targeting of CD105 may represent a potent anticancer strategy and should be further evaluated in pre-clinical models. © 2017 The Author(s).","5-FU resistance; Autophagy; CD105; Endoglin; Pancreatic cancer; Photochemical internalization",Article,Scopus

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is characterized by an immune suppressive microenvironment, and response of ovarian cancers to immune therapies has thus far been disappointing. We now find, in a mouse model of EOC, that clinically relevant doses of DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors (DNMTi and HDACi, respectively) reduce the immune suppressive microenvironment through type I IFN signaling and improve response to immune checkpoint therapy. These data indicate that the type I IFN response is required for effective in vivo antitumorigenic actions of the DNMTi 5-azacytidine (AZA). Through type I IFN signaling, AZA increases the numbers of CD45+ immune cells and the percentage of active CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells in the tumor microenvironment, while reducing tumor burden and extending survival. AZA also increases viral defense gene expression in both tumor and immune cells, and reduces the percentage of macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment. The addition of an HDACi to AZA enhances the modulation of the immune microenvironment, specifically increasing T and NK cell activation and reducing macrophages over AZA treatment alone, while further increasing the survival of the mice. Finally, a triple combination of DNMTi/HDACi plus the immune checkpoint inhibitor α-PD-1 provides the best antitumor effect and longest overall survival, and may be an attractive candidate for future clinical trials in ovarian cancer.","5-azacytidine; Histone deacetylase inhibitors; Immunosuppression; Ovarian cancer; Type I interferon",Article,Scopus

The burden of disease persists in part due to a lack of access to early diagnostics and the fact that a significant proportion of women do not return for follow-up care. To address this need, we developed a low-cost, portable Pocket colposcope that can be used in remote settings for cervical cancer screening and prevention. We evaluated whether the Pocket colposcope performs comparably to the standard-of-care colposcope in Durham, North Carolina, Lima, Perú, and Moshi, Tanzania. Concordant image pairs obtained from this device and the current standard imaging was sent to physician experts from high, middle, and low-income countries. They were blinded as to diagnosis, device, and peer response. Each image was critically evaluated for quality and presumptive findings and compared. Corresponding pathology was obtained for each patient. Physician interpretation agreed 76.8% of the time between the Pocket colposcope and standard-of-care colposcope. Physician interpretation agreed with pathology 59.4% and 63.0% for the Pocket and standard-of-care colposcopes, respectively. The primary outcome of this study was to show reasonable concordance between the Pocket colposcope and state of the art imaging in terms of individual examiners, pathologic diagnosis, and image quality. In all areas the Pocket colposcope showed comparable results to country-specific standard-of-care screening. © 2017 IEEE.",,Conference Paper,Scopus

A growing body of evidence supports irradiation of this region in node-positive breast cancer. This study evaluated the effectiveness of radiotherapy in treating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-detected abnormal IM lymph nodes in newly-diagnosed non-metastatic breast cancer. Methods: A structured query was performed on an electronic institutional database to identify women with radiographic evidence of abnormal IM node(s) on breast MRI from 2005 to 2013. Manual review narrowed inclusion to patients with a primary diagnosis of non-metastatic breast cancer with abnormal IM node(s) based on pathologic size criteria and/or abnormal enhancement. Results: Of the 7070 women who underwent pre-treatment MRI, 19 (0.3%) were identified on imaging to have a total of 25 abnormal pre-treatment IM lymph nodes, of which 96% were located in the first two intercostal spaces and 4% in the third space. A majority of the primary tumors were high-grade (94.7%) and hormone-receptor negative (73.7%), while 47.4% overexpressed HER-2/neu receptor. Axillary nodal disease was present in 89.5% of patients, while one patient had supraclavicular involvement. At a median follow-up of 38 months, 31.6% of patients had developed metastatic disease and 21.1% had died from their disease. Of the patients who received IM coverage, none had progressive disease within the IM lymph node chain. Conclusions: Radiologic evidence of pre-treatment abnormal IM chain lymph nodes was associated with advanced stage, high grade, and negative estrogen receptor status. The majority of positive lymph nodes were located within the first two intercostal spaces, while none were below the third. Radiation of the IM chain in combination with modern systemic therapy was effective in achieving locoregional control without surgical resection in this cohort of patients. © 2017 The Author(s).","Breast; Breast neoplasms; Lymph nodes; Magnetic resonance imaging; Radiotherapy",Article,Scopus

Under the rubric of TouchComp, the best solution in the parameter space is associated with the target to be detected. A population of externally steerable agents locate the optimal solution by moving through the parameter space, whose landscape (objective function) may be altered by these agents but the location of the best solution remains unchanged. Thus, one can infer the parameter space by observing the movement of agents. The term 'touchable' emphasizes the framework's similarity to controlling by touching the screen with a finger, where the external field for controlling and tracking acts as the finger. We apply the TouchComp model to cancer detection, where the target is the cancer, the parameter space is the tissue region at high risk of malignancy, and agents are nanorobots loaded with contrast medium molecules for tracking purpose. Given this analogy, we revisit the classical particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and apply it to TouchComp in order to achieve effective cancer detection. The PSO is modified by taking into account realistic in vivo propagation, controlling, and tracking conditions of nanorobots. Finally, we present numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed computing-inspired bio-detection strategy. © 2017 IEEE.","Computing-inspired bio-detection; Contrast-enhanced medical imaging; Metaheuristics; Nanorobots; Touchable computation",Conference Paper,Scopus

We evaluated whether smoking could modify associations between these genetic variants and CRC risk. Methods: A total of 703 CRC patients and 1406 healthy controls were included in this case-control study from the National Cancer Center in Korea. Thirty CRC susceptibility SNPs identified in previous GWAS were genotyped. A logistic regression model was used to examine associations between the SNPs and smoking behaviors by sex. The interaction was estimated by including an additional interaction term in the model. Results: In men, an increased CRC risk was observed for longer durations (OR&gt;28 vs. ≤28years = 1.49 (95% CI = 1.11-1.98)), greater quantities (OR≥20 vs. &lt;20cigarettes/day = 2.12 (1.61-2.79)), and longer pack-years of smoking (OR≥21 vs. &lt;21pack-years = 1.78 (1.35-2.35)). In women, longer pack-years of smoking significantly increased CRC risk (OR≥5 vs. &lt;5pack-years = 6.11 (1.10-34.00)). Moreover, there were significant interactions between smoking status and the polymorphisms rs1957636 at 14q22.3 (P interaction = 5.5 × 10-4) and rs4813802 at 20p12.3 (P interaction = 0.04) in men.

Both clinical and treatment planning studies were investigated. Material and methods: A Pubmed/MEDLINE search of the National Library of Medicine was performed to identify VMAT and breast related articles. After a first order rejection of the irrelevant findings, the remaining articles were grouped according to two main categories: clinical vs. planning studies and to some sub-categories (pointing to significant technical features). Main areas of application, dosimetric and clinical findings as well as areas of innovations were defined. Results: A total of 131 articles were identified and of these, 67 passed a first order selection. Six studies reported clinical results while 61 treatment dealed with treatment planning investigations. Among the innovation lines, the use of high intensity photon beams (flattening filter free), altered fractionation schemes (simultaneous integrated boost, accelerated partial breast irradiation, single fraction), prone positioning and modification of standard VMAT (use of dynamic trajectories or hybrid VMAT methods) resulted among the main relevant fields of interest. Approximately 10% of the publications reported upon respiratory gating in conjunction with VMAT. Conclusions: The role of VMAT in the radiation treatment of breast cancer seems to be consolidated in the in-silico arena while still limited evidence and only one phase II trial appeared in literature from the clinical viewpoint. More clinical reports are needed to fully proove the expected dosimetric benefits demonstrated in the planning investigations. © 2017 The Author(s).","Breast cancer; Radiotherapy; Volumetric modulated arc therapy",Review,Scopus

Dermatologic reaction is common with various chemotherapy agents but is not commonly reported in the use of capecitabine. When adverse reactions of rashes occur, the offending agent is typically removed. We report here an unusual case of photosensitive lichenoid rash due to capecitabine which is managed conservatively without major alteration in treatment. Case presentation: Seventy-three year old female with a diagnosis of stage IV breast cancer undergoing management with capecitabine presents with a rash during the summer months that is biopsy proven to be lichenoid photosensitive rash with likely offending agent being capecitabine. Her treatment was initially held despite having response to treatment, started on topical steroids after evaluation by dermatology. Given her response to treatment, drug was resumed with instructions to use sun precaution, sunscreen, and to complete course of topical steroids until rash resolution. Conclusion: Drug-related rashes tend to lead to disruptions or alterations in treatments of malignancies, despite responses. Given the wide use of capecitabine in many different solid tumors, it is important to recognize this photosensitive related skin rash and to initiate appropriate precautions of sun safety and topical steroids to allow minimal disruptions in therapy and continue use of capecitabine. © 2017 The Author(s).","Breast cancer; Capecitabine; Drug rash; Lichenoid rash; Photosensitive; Rash",Article,Scopus

These results indicate that TBX19 may work as an oncogene in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the expression and role of TBX19 have yet to be investigated. Here, we investigated TBX19 mRNA and protein expressions in colon cancer cells or surgically resected CRC. We found that TBX19 mRNA expression was significantly increased in tumorous tissues compared to that in non-tumorous tissues, and increased TBX19 mRNA expression was associated with positive lymph node metastasis in our cohort. The expression of TBX19 mRNA was not correlated with that of TBX19 protein in tissue sample taken from the CRC patients. Moreover, TBX19 showed positive staining even in the normal colonic tissues and the adjacent non-tumorous tissues.

They share a conserved domain for the recognition of carbohydrates (CRD). Although galectins have a common affinity for β-galatosides, they exhibit different binding preferences for complex glycans. First described twenty years ago, galectin-7 is a prototypic galectin, with a single CRD, able to form divalent homodimers. This lectin, which is mainly expressed in stratified epithelia, has been described in epithelial tissues as being involved in apoptotic responses, in proliferation and differentiation but also in cell adhesion and migration. Most members of the galectins family have been associated with cancer biology. One of the main functions of galectins in cancer is their immunomodulating potential and anti-angiogenic activity. Indeed, galectin-1 and -3, are already targeted in clinical trials. Another relevant function of galectins in tumour progression is their ability to regulate cell migration and cell adhesion. Among these galectins, galectin-7 is abnormally expressed in various cancers, most prominently in carcinomas, and is involved in cancer progression and metastasis but its precise functions in tumour biology remain poorly understood. In this issue, we will focus on the physiological functions of galectin-7 in epithelia and present the alterations of galectin-7 expression in carcinomas with the aim to describe its possible functions in tumour progression. © 2017 by the authors.

Interleukin-6 (IL6) was identified as an important local immune-related risk marker related to unfavourable prognosis. In this study, we further investigated the role and regulation of IL6 signalling in glioma. Methods: The expression and prognostic value of IL6 and the IL6 receptor (IL6R) were explored in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and REMBRANDT databases and clinical samples. Functional effects of genetic knockdown and overexpression of IL6R or IL6 stimulation were examined in vitro and in tumours in vivo. The effects of the nuclear factor of activated T cells-1 (NFAT1) on the promoter activities of IL6R and IL6 were also examined. Results: High IL6- and IL6R-expression were significantly associated with mesenchymal subtype and IDH-wildtype gliomas, and were predictors of poor survival. Knockdown of IL6R decreased cell proliferation, invasion and neurosphere formation in vitro, and inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo. IL6R overexpression or IL6 stimulation enhanced the invasion and growth of glioma cells. TCGA database searching revealed that IL6- and IL6R-expression were correlated with that of NFAT1. In glioma cells, NFAT1 enhanced the promoter activities of IL6R and IL6, and upregulated the expression of both IL6R and IL6. Conclusion: NFAT1-regulated IL6 signalling contributes to aggressive phenotypes of gliomas, emphasizing the role of immunomodulatory factors in glioma malignant progression. © 2017 The Author(s).","Glioblastoma; Glioma; IL6; IL6R; NFAT1",Article,Scopus

Results: In this study, we developed a kind of dual drug [methotrexate (MTX) and 10-hydroxycamptothecine (HCPT)] loaded nanoneedles (DDNDs) with pronounced targeting property, high drug loading and prolonged drug release. The anti-solvent precipitation of the HCPT and MTX modified PEG-b-PLGA (PEG-b-PLGA-MTX, PPMTX) leads to nucleation of nanoneedles with nanocrystalline HCPT as the core wrapped with PPMTX as steric stabilizers. In vitro cell uptake studies showed that the DDNDs revealed an obviously targeting property and entered the HeLa cells easier than the nanoneedles without MTX modification. The cytotoxicity tests illustrated that the DDNDs possessed better killing ability to HeLa cells than the individual drugs or their mixture in the same dose, indicating its good synergistic effect and targeting property. The in vivo studies further confirmed these conclusions.

Methods: This multicenter, prospective cohort study involved chemotherapy-receiving early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) patients. Self-perceived cognitive function was longitudinally assessed using the validated FACT-Cog (ver. 3) across three time points: Prior to chemotherapy (T1), during chemotherapy (T2), and at the end of chemotherapy (T3). Plasma BDNF levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genotyping was performed using Sanger Sequencing. Results: A total of 51 chemotherapy-receiving ESBC patients (mean age: 52.6 ± 9.5 years) were recruited, and 11 patients (21.6%) reported subjective cognitive impairment post-chemotherapy. Overall, there was a reduction in median plasma BDNF levels over time (T1: 5423.0 pg/ml; T2: 5313.6 pg/ml; T3: 4050.3 pg/ml; p < 0.01). After adjusting for confounding factors, longitudinal analysis revealed that BDNF levels were associated with self-reported concentration deficit (p = 0.032). Carriers of Val/Val (p = 0.011) and Val/Met (p = 0.003) BDNF genotypes demonstrated a significant reduction in plasma BDNF levels over time; however, plasma BDNF levels were similar across all time points among Met homozygous carriers (p = 0.107). Conclusion: There was a statistically significant change in BDNF levels post-chemotherapy in ESBC patients, and plasma BDNF levels were associated with self-perceived concentration deficit in patients receiving chemotherapy. © 2017 The Author(s).","BDNF; Breast cancer; Cognition; Genetics; Rs6265",Article,Scopus

We have reported that peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2) is associated with CRC invasion and metastasis. However, the mechanisms regulating PRDX2 expression remain unclear. We investigate whether microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate PRDX2 expression in CRC progression. Methods: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to measure microRNA-200b-3p (miR-200b-3p) expression. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to detect c-Myc and PRDX2 protein levels in CRC tissue samples (n = 97). Western blot was used to quantify PRDX2, c-Myc, AKT2/GSK3β pathway-associated proteins and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins in CRC cells. Luciferase reporter assays were used to analyze the interaction between miR-200b-3p and 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of PRDX2 mRNA and AKT2 mRNA as well as c-Myc and the miR-200b-3p promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to evaluate binding of c-Myc to the miR-200b-3p promoter. Invasive assay and metastatic model were used to assess invasive and metastatic capacities of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, drug-induced apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. Results: We found that miR-200b-3p was significantly downregulated, whereas c-Myc and PRDX2 were upregulated in metastatic CRC cells and CRC tissues compared to their counterparts. An inverse correlation existed between c-Myc and miR-200b-3p, and between miR-200b-3p and PRDX2. We also found that PRDX2 was a target of miR-200b-3p. Importantly, overexpression of nontargetable PRDX2 eliminated the suppressive effects of miR-200b-3p on proliferation, invasion, EMT, chemotherapeutic resistance and metastasis of CRC cells. Moreover, c-Myc bound to the promoter of miR-200b-3p and repressed its transcription. In turn, miR-200b-3p disrupted the stability of c-Myc protein by inducing c-Myc protein threonine 58 (T58) phosphorylation and serine 62 (S62) dephosphorylation via AKT2/GSK3β pathway. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that the c-Myc/miR-200b/PRDX2 loop regulates CRC progression and its disruption enhances tumor metastasis and chemotherapeutic resistance in CRC. © 2017 The Author(s).","C-Myc; Chemotherapeutic resistance; Colorectal cancer; Metastasis; MiR-200b-3p; PRDX2",Article,Scopus

The aim of this study was to compare the expression of CCDC34 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma with normal pancreatic tissue, and to evaluate the prognostic significance of CCDC34 expression in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, using bioinformatics. Material/Methods: The expression and prognostic value of CCDC34 were initially predicted using Oncomine and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissue samples (N=90) and matched normal pancreatic tissues (N=90) were studied using immunohistochemistry to measure CCDC34 protein expression levels. Univariate Kaplan-Meier, and multivariate Cox analysis were used to determine the prognostic role of CCDC34 expression. Results: Oncomine and TCGA databases predicted that CCDC34 mRNA expression levels were significantly increased in pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared with normal pancreatic tissues (P<0.05), and that patients with increased CCDC34 mRNA expression levels had significantly lower overall survival (OS) (P=0.031). Immunohistochemistry showed that expression levels of CCDC34 protein in pancreatic adenocarcinoma were significantly increased, compared with normal pancreas (P=0.000). Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma with increased expression of tissue CCDC34 had significantly reduced OS compared with patients with low expression (P=0.000).

Methods: The clinical and MRI materials of 247 patients of suspicious prostate disease treated in Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from June 2015 to November 2016 were analyzed retrospectively, including 110 cases with PCa and 137 cases without cancer. All cases underwent the high-resolution axial T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhancement-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and were confirmed pathologically by puncture biopsies. The Mp-MRI materials of all cases were scored according to PI-RADS v2.The prostate volume and prostate specific antigen (PSA) density (PSAD) value were calculated according to the formulas. The univariate and multivariate analysis were performed for the observed indicators (age, prostate volume, PSA, PSAD and PI-RADS v2 score) to determine the independent predictors for PCa. Then, a Logistic regression model (combined prediction model) was established by the independent predictors for combined diagnosis of PCa. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) curve analysis was performed to get the sensitivity and specificity of each independent predictor and the model to diagnose PCa. The differences of AUC values of each independent predictor and the model were compared with each other to evaluate the diagnostic performance for PCa. Results: The differences in the age, prostate volume, PSA, PSAD and the PI-RADS v2 score between patients with PCa and non-cancer group were all statistically significant (t=2.870, Z=-4.230, -7.787, -9.477, -10.826, all P&lt;0.05). The PSAD and PI-RADS v2 score were independent predictors for PCa (OR=3.331, 10.546, both P&lt;0.05). The Logistic regression combined prediction model by PI-RADS v2 score and PSAD to forecast PCa was Logit(P)=-5.097+ 2.309×PSAD+ 1.214×PI-RADS v2 score. The area under the curve (AUC) of ROC in the combined model (0.911) was higher than that in the PI-RADS v2 score (0.886) and PSAD (0.851) and the differences were all statistically significant (Z=2.416, 2.716, both P&lt;0.05); but the difference in the AUC value between PI-RADS v2 score and PSAD was not statistically significant (Z=1.191, P=0.234). The diagnostic sensitivity of PSAD, PI-RADS v2 score and the model were: 0.891, 0.782 and 0.855, respectively; the specificity were 0.449, 0.912 and 0.847, respectively on their positive thresholds (0.15 μg·L-1·ml-1, 4 and -0.82).

Anti-inflammatory substances can prevent carcinogenesis mediated by cytotoxic effects and can prevent DNA damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity and apoptotic/antigenotoxic effects of horchata as well as its mechanism. Methods: Nine different varieties of horchata were prepared in the traditional way and then freeze-dried. Phytochemical screening tested for the presence of secondary metabolites using standard procedures and antioxidant activities. The cytotoxic activity was evaluated on cerebral astrocytoma (D-384), prostate cancer (PC-3), breast cancer (MCF-7), colon cancer (RKO), lung cancer (A-549), immortalized Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1), and human peripheral blood lymphocytes via a MTS assay. The pro-apoptotic effects were evaluated with Anexin V/Propidium Iodide and western blot of Bax, Bcl-2, TP53, and TP73. Induction and reduction of ROS were assessed by fluorimetry. Genotoxic and antigenotoxic effects were evaluated with a comet assay and micronuclei on binucleated cells. Results: Five of nine horchatas had cytotoxic effects against D-384 while not affecting normal cells. These horchatas induce cell death by apoptosis modulated by p53/p73. In CHO-K1 cells, the horchatas decrease the damage induced by hydrogen peroxide and Mitomycin C measured in the comet and micronucleus assay respectively. Conclusions: The IC50 range of effective horchatas in D-384 was 41 to 122 μg·mL-1. This effect may be related to its use in traditional medicine (brain tonic). On the other hand, immortalized Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) and lymphocytes did not show a cytotoxic effect. The most potent horchata induced apoptosis via a p53/p73-mediated mechanism. The horchatas present antigenotoxic properties, which may be related to the antioxidant capacity.

In humans, congenital defects and recurrent structural abnormalities can be attributed to aberrant meiotic recombination. Moreover, mutations affecting genes involved in recombination pathways are directly linked to pathologies including infertility and cancer. Recombination is among the most prominent mechanism shaping genome variation, and is associated with not only the structuring of genomic variability, but is also tightly linked with the purging of deleterious mutations from populations. Together, these observations highlight the multiple roles of recombination in human genetics: its ability to act as a major force of evolution, its molecular potential to maintain genome repair and integrity in cell division and its mutagenic cost impacting disease evolution. © 2017 The Authors.","Cancer; Disease; Gene conversion; Mutation load; PRDM9; Recombination",Review,Scopus

A common screening and detection technique for breast cancer is mammography. Though Mammography is now considered as the benchmark technique for the early screening and diagnosis of breast cancer, it utilizes harmful ionizing radiations, namely, X-Rays. Moreover the procedure is quite uncomfortable, painful and embarrassing for women, making it less attractive as a preventive screening tool. These disadvantages of mammography can be overcome by using ultrasound imaging technique. Ultrasound is normally considered safe and can be used in soft tissue such as breast. However the quality of the image is compromised due to the predominance of speckle noise. This paper focuses on developing an algorithm for an automatic segmentation and classification of breast lesions from ultrasound image in which the speckle noise was reduced using Tetrolet filter and breast lesions were automatically segmented by using statistical feature based active contour method. After segmentation, for the classification of breast lesion, totally 40 features such as 15 textural, 21 morphological and 4 fractal features were extracted from the images. Optimal features were selected to increase the classification performance by using ReleifF algorithm and 10 best features were taken into account for feature ranking. These features were used to classify the lesions from breast ultrasound images by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with polynomial kernel for the combination of texture, morphological and fractal features from the Tetrolet filter. This method would help the radiologist to detect and classify the lesions automatically. © 2017 IEEE.","Automatic Segmentation; Breast ultrasound Image; Feature Extraction; Feature Selection and Classification",Conference Paper,Scopus

Thus, we conducted a retrospective study to investigate the prognostic importance of McVI in tumor staging in patients with HCC who underwent hepatic resection. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed of patients who underwent hepatic resection for HCC at our center from 1994 to 2012. Patients with HCC were classified into four groups based on the presence of McVI and extent of gross vascular invasion (VI). Results: The 5-year overall and recurrence-free survival rates of 676 patients were 63.3 and 42.6%, respectively. There was no difference in tumor recurrence or survival rate between patients with HCC and McVI without gross VI and those with gross VI confined to segmental/sectional branches. Multivariate analysis revealed that the extent of VI based on the presence of McVI and gross VI was independently associated with tumor recurrence and overall survival. Conclusions: McVI was revealed to be an important risk factor similar to gross VI confined to a segmental/sectional branch in patients with HCC who underwent hepatic resection.

The relative importance of the tumor microenvironment and cancer cell-intrinsic signaling in the regulation of PD-L1 expression remains unclear. We report that oncogenic RAS signaling can upregulate tumor cell PD-L1 expression through a mechanism involving increases in PD-L1 mRNA stability via modulation of the AU-rich element-binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP). TTP negatively regulates PD-L1 expression through AU-rich elements in the 3′ UTR of PD-L1 mRNA. MEK signaling downstream of RAS leads to phosphorylation and inhibition of TTP by the kinase MK2. In human lung and colorectal tumors, RAS pathway activation is associated with elevated PD-L1 expression. In vivo, restoration of TTP expression enhances anti-tumor immunity dependent on degradation of PD-L1 mRNA. We demonstrate that RAS can drive cell-intrinsic PD-L1 expression, thus presenting therapeutic opportunities to reverse the innately immunoresistant phenotype of RAS mutant cancers. Coelho et al. demonstrate a post-transcriptional mechanism whereby oncogenic RAS signaling increases PD-L1 expression. Mechanistically, PD-L1 mRNA is targeted by TTP through AU-rich elements in the 3′ UTR, making it unstable. Oncogenic RAS signaling reduces TTP activity and stabilizes the PD-L1 transcript. Restoring TTP activity reduces PD-L1 expression and enhances anti-tumor immunity. © 2017 The Author(s)","immunotherapy; KRAS; PD-L1; RAS; tristetraprolin; TTP",Article,Scopus

However, its low penetration depth and photodamage of living tissues by UV and visible light, which activate a photosensitizer, limit the application of PDT. In this study, monodisperse NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanospheres 20 nm in diameter, that serve as near-infrared (NIR)-to-visible light converters and activators of a photosensitizer, were synthesized by high-temperature co-precipitation of lanthanide chlorides in a high-boiling organic solvent (octadec-1-ene). The nanoparticles were coated with a thin shell (≈3 nm) of homogenous silica via the hydrolysis and condensation of tetramethyl orthosilicate. The NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@SiO2 particles were further functionalized by methacrylate-terminated groups via 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate. To introduce a large number of reactive amino groups on the particle surface, methacrylate-terminated NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@SiO2 nanospheres were modified with a branched polyethyleneimine (PEI) via Michael addition. Aluminum carboxyphthalocyanine (Al Pc-COOH) was then conjugated to NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@SiO2-PEI nanospheres via carbodiimide chemistry. The resulting NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@SiO2-PEI-Pc particles were finally modified with succinimidyl ester of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) in order to alleviate their future uptake by the reticuloendothelial system. Upon 980 nm irradiation, the intensive red emission of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@SiO2-PEI-Pc-PEG nanoparticles completely vanished, indicating efficient energy transfer from the nanoparticles to Al Pc-COOH, which generates singlet oxygen (1O2). Last but not least, NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@SiO2-PEI-Pc-PEG nanospheres were intratumorally administered into mammary carcinoma MDA-MB-231 growing subcutaneously in athymic nude mice. Extensive necrosis developed at the tumor site of all mice 24–48 h after irradiation by laser at 980 nm wavelength. The results demonstrate that the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@SiO2-PEI-Pc-PEG nanospheres have great potential as a novel NIR-triggered PDT nanoplatform for deep-tissue cancer therapy. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Herein we describe the design, synthesis, biological evaluation in cellular models of cancer, and preliminary drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies (DMPK) of a series of secondary and tertiary N-substituted 7-aminoheptanohydroxamic acid-based HDAC inhibitors. Introduction of an amino group with one or two surface binding groups (SBGs) yielded a successful strategy to develop novel and potent HDAC inhibitors. The secondary amines were found to be generally more potent than the corresponding tertiary amines. Docking studies suggested that the SBGs of tertiary amines cannot be favorably accommodated at the gorge region of the binding site. The secondary amines with naphthalen-2-ylmethyl, 5-phenylthiophen-2-ylmethyl, and 1H-indol-2-ylmethyl (2 j) substituents exhibited the highest potency against class I HDACs: HDAC1 IC50 39–61 nm, HDAC2 IC50 260–690 nm, HDAC3 IC50 25–68 nm, and HDAC8 IC50 320–620 nm. The cytotoxicity of a representative set of secondary and tertiary N-substituted 7-aminoheptanoic acid hydroxyamide-based inhibitors against HT-29, SH-SY5Y, and MCF-7 cancer cells correlated with their inhibition of HDAC1, 2, and 3 and was found to be similar to or better than that of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). Compounds in this series increased the acetylation of histones H3 and H4 in a time-dependent manner. DMPK studies indicated that secondary amine 2 j is metabolically stable and has plasma and brain concentrations &gt;23- and &gt;1.6-fold higher than the IC50 value for class I HDACs, respectively.

From an initial multitude of 17 features describing the geometry, colour, and texture of the CS images, the QPSO stage of our proposed technique is used to select the best subset features (i.e., global best particles) that represent a pruned down collection of seven features. Using a dataset of almost 1000 images, performance evaluation of our proposed Q-Fuzzy approach assesses the impact of our feature selection on classification accuracy by way of three experimental scenarios that are compared alongside two other approaches: the All-features (i.e., classification without prior feature selection) and another hybrid technique combining the standard PSO algorithm with the Fuzzy k-NN technique (P-Fuzzy approach). In the first and second scenarios, we further divided the assessment criteria in terms of classification accuracy based on the choice of best features and those in terms of the different categories of the cervical cells. In the third scenario, we introduced new QH hybrid techniques, i.e., QPSO combined with other supervised learning methods, and compared the classification accuracy alongside our proposed Q-Fuzzy approach. Furthermore, we employed statistical approaches to establish qualitative agreement with regards to the feature selection in the experimental scenarios 1 and 3. The synergy between the QPSO and Fuzzy k-NN in the proposed Q-Fuzzy approach improves classification accuracy as manifest in the reduction in number cell features, which is crucial for effective cervical cancer detection and diagnosis. © 2017 by the authors.

Indeed, in eukaryotes, miRNAs have been found to regulate and control gene expression by degrading mRNA at the post-transcriptional level. In this study, we investigated the expression of miR-34 family members, miR-34b and miR-34c, in different PCa cell lines, and discussed the molecular mechanism of miR-34b in the invasion and migration of PCa cells in vitro. The difference analyses of the transcriptome between the DU145 and PC3 cell lines demonstrated that both miR-34b and -34c target critical pathways that are involved in metabolism, such as proliferation, and migration, and invasion. The molecular expression of miR-34b/c were lower in PC3 cells.

This low delivery efficiency has major implications in the translation of cancer nanomedicines, as most of the nanomedicines are sequestered by nontumor cells. To improve the delivery efficiency, there is a need to investigate the quantitative contribution of each organ in blocking the transport of nanoparticles to solid tumors. Here, we hypothesize that the removal of the liver macrophages, cells that have been reported to take up the largest amount of circulating nanoparticles, would lead to a significant increase in the nanoparticle delivery efficiency to solid tumors. We were surprised to discover that the maximum achievable delivery efficiency was only 2%. In our analysis, there was a clear correlation between particle design, chemical composition, macrophage depletion, tumor pathophysiology, and tumor delivery efficiency. In many cases, we observed an 18-150 times greater delivery efficiency, but we were not able to achieve a delivery efficiency higher than 2%. The results suggest the need to look deeper at other organs such as the spleen, lymph nodes, and tumor in mediating the delivery process.

Our results herein offer an explanation for the emergence of DEAE-Dextran as an anti-tumor agent for TNBC with in-depth mechanistic approach as an anti-angiogenic molecule. DEAE-Dextran has found to possess cytotoxic activity demonstrated during the various in vitro cytotoxicity assays; moreover, as an anti-oxidant, DEAE-Dextran has shown to possess excellent reactive oxygen species scavenging activity. The interferon inducing capacity of DEAE-Dextran was determined qualitatively as well as quantitatively specifically demonstrating overexpression of β-interferon. As a measure of anti-proliferative activity, DEAE-Dextran exhibited reduced ki67, p53, and PCNA levels. Also, overexpression of CK5/6 and p63 in DEAE-Dextran treated animals indicated improvement in breast cell morphology along with an improvement in cell-cell adhesion by virtue of upregulation of β-catenin and E-cadherin. Anti-angiogenic property of DEAE-Dextran was concluded by the downregulation of CD31, VEGF, and NOTCH1 both in vivo and in vitro. Further, apoptosis due to DEAE-Dextran, initially determined by downregulation of Bcl2, was confirmed with flow cytometry. Overall, results are defensive of DEAE-Dextran as an emerging anti-tumor agent with mechanisms pertaining to β-interferon induction with probable VEGF and NOTCH1 inhibition as well as apoptosis which still needs to be studied in further depth. © 2017 Bakrania, Variya and Patel.","Angiogenesis; Anti-proliferative; Apoptosis; DEAE-Dextran; NOTCH1; TNBC; VEGF; β-interferon",Article,Scopus

Thereby, evaluating the approach with over one hundred different acquisitions of metastases. The two physicians or the algorithm had never assessed the acquisitions before the evaluation. In summary, the physicians first performed a pure manual outlining followed by an algorithmic segmentation over one month later. As a result, the experts satisfied in up to ninety percent of algorithmic segmentation results. Furthermore, the algorithmic segmentation was much faster than manual outlining and achieved a median Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of over eighty percent.

The outdoor gamma dose rate in the air was measured using a portable digital environmental radiation detector at 170 locations. The mean outdoor gamma dose rate in the air was determined as 121 nGy h-1 with a range between 23 and 320 nGy h-1. The annual effective dose for districts was between 0.04 and 0.59 mSv year-1 with a mean value of 0.23 mSv year-1. Excess lifetime cancer risk values for districts ranged from 0.14×10-3 to 2.07×10-3 with a mean of 0.80×10-3. The activity concentrations of 226Ra, 232Th, 40K and 137Cs in 84 soil samples were determined using HPGe detector. The mean activity values (ranges) of 226Ra, 232Th, 40K and 137Cs in soil samples were found to be 20.4 (4.9±3.0-53.0±0.8) Bq kg-1, 38.8 (3.7±0.2-163.5±1.8) Bq kg-1, 598.0 (108.5±70.2-1500.5±38.7) Bq kg-1 and 3.9 (0.2±0.1-11.9±0.7) Bq kg-1, respectively. The mean activity concentration of 232Th and 40K was higher than the world's mean value. The mean radium equivalent activity was 119.76 Bq kg-1 which is lower than the recommended maximum value of 370 Bq kg-1. The mean external terrestrial gamma dose rate was found to be 56.71 nGy h-1. This mean value was lower than the world mean of 60 nGy h-1. The calculated external hazard value was 0.32 and within the acceptable limit which is less than unity (Hex≤1). The indoor radon concentration in 150 houses for the summer and winter seasons was determined using solid state nuclear track detector (CR-39). The mean indoor concentration for the summer season was found to be 63.27 Bq m-3 ranging from 14.0±1.5 to 288.0±21.9 Bq m-3. On the other hand, the mean indoor concentration in the winter season was found to be 86.94 Bq m-3 ranging from 17.0±4.5 to 484.0±26.9 Bq m-3.

Methods: Clinical date of 140 patients with melanoma in the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed the optimal cut-off value for PLR. The 140 patients were divided into high PLR group and low PLR group. According to ""Guidelines for prevention and control of overweight and obesity in Chinese adults"", the patients were divided into high BMI group and low BMI group. The relationship between PLR, BMI with overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) and disease free survival (DFS) were analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method and Log rank test was used for univariate survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression model for multivariate analysis. Results: The optimal cut-off value of PLR determined by ROC curve was PLR=120.15, and BMI threshold was 24.Univariate survival analysis showed that PLR, BMI and clinical stage were the factors affecting the OS in patients (P<0.05). The median survival time (MST) was 21 months in the whole group and 17 months in the high PLR group, 34 months in the low PLR group, respectively; the MST in the high and low BMI group were 29 months and 13 months, respectively. The difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The effects of PLR and BMI on PFS and DFS were not statistically significant. Cox multivariate analysis showed that PLR, BMI and clinical stage were independent prognostic factors of OS (P<0.05). And BMI was the only independent protective factor for OS, the risk of death decreased by 0.611 times, with each unit increased for BMI. Clinical subgroup analysis showed that PLR also was risk factor to the prognosis of patients with stage II, III, and IV (P<0.05). Conclusions: PLR is an independent prognostic risk factor for patients with melanoma, and BMI is an independent protective factor. PLR and BMI are important factors in prognostic evaluation of melanoma.

However, during chemotherapy, the presence of numerous side effects and the onset of frequent phenomena of resistance has pushed many research groups to devise new metal-based compounds holding improved anticancer properties and fewer undesired effects. Amongst the variety of synthesized compounds, significant antiproliferative effects have been obtained by employing organometallic compounds, particularly those based on silver and gold. With this in mind, we synthesized four compounds, two silver complexes and two gold complexes, with good inhibitory effects on the in vitro proliferation of breast and ovarian cancer-cell models. The antitumor activity of the most active compound, that is, AuL4, was found to be ninefold higher than that of cisplatin, and this compound induced dramatic morphological changes in HeLa cells. AuL4 induced PARP-1 cleavage, caspases 3/7 and 9 activation, mitochondria disruption, cytochrome c release in cancer-cell cytoplasm, and the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, AuL4 treatment caused cancer-cell death by the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, whereas no cytotoxic effects were recorded upon treating non-tumor cell lines. The reported outcomes may be an important contribution to the expanding knowledge of medicinal bio-organometallic chemistry and enlarge the available anticancer toolbox, offering improved features, such as higher activity and/or selectivity, and opening the way to new discoveries and applications. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Methods: We analyzed medical records of patients with advanced sarcoma who were referred to Phase 1 clinic at MD Anderson and received an immunotherapy (checkpoint inhibitors, vaccines, or cytokine based therapies). Clinical parameters including demographics, clinical history, toxicity, and response were abstracted. Results: Among 50 patients enrolled in immunotherapy trials (Bone 10; Soft-tissue 40) we found 14 different subtypes of sarcomas. Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) prognostic score was <2 (86%). Performance status (PS) was 0-1 in 48 patients (96%); median number of prior therapies was 3 (0-12).

However, the increasing incidence of sun/UV exposure-related illness, such as skin cancer, is seriously concerning public health authorities as well as the scientific community. Consequently, moderate sun/UV exposure is strongly recommended. A wearable nanoplasmonic patch whose original color changes upon sun exposure due to its UV-responsive capabilities that are visually detectable has been engineered. The main scaffold of this patch is made of nanopaper, which is a flexible, lightweight, optically transparent and biocompatible material. Moreover, its UV-responsive agent is based on silver nanoparticles (AgNP), whose nanoplasmonic properties and safe use in bioapplications are widely covered in the literature. As UV light can modulate the size of AgNP significantly, the nanoplasmonic properties of the AgNP-decorated nanopaper are also modulated leading to a change in color, which is readily observable upon sun exposure. This facilitates that the users can be alerted to moderate sun exposure and may prevent skin damage. Given the transparent nanoplasmonic nature of the resulting device, after 15 min of artificial sunlight exposure, the change in color of the patch was proven more observable in skins with the highest and moderate risk of developing skin cancer (skin types I, II, III, and IV) than in skin types V and VI - which are reported to tolerate relatively high levels of sun exposure safely.

Cross-linked fluorescent nanoparticles (C-FNP) consisting of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD)/boronic acid (BA) and fluorescent hyaluronic acid [FNP(HA)] were conjugated to fluorescent polydopamine [FNP(pDA)]. To determine the quenching effect of this system, hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl phosphate (NPP) to 4-nitrophenol (NP) was performed in the cavity of β-CD in the presence of ALP activated photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between NP and C-FNP. At an ALP level of 30-1000 U/L, NP caused off-emission of C-FNP because of their specific host-guest recognition. Fluorescence can be recovered under pH shock due to cleavage of the diol bond between β-CD and BA, resulting in release of NP from the fluorescent system. Sensitivity of the assays was assessed by confocal imaging not only in aqueous states, but also for the first time on coated surfaces in MDAMB-231 and MDCK cells. This novel system demonstrated high sensitivity to ALP through generation of good electron donor/acceptor pair during the PET process.

Accordingly, HDAC6 is a target for the development of selective inhibitors that might be useful in new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and other disorders. Here, we present high-resolution structures of catalytic domain 2 from Danio rerio HDAC6 (henceforth simply ""HDAC6"") complexed with compounds that selectively inhibit HDAC6 while maintaining nanomolar inhibitory potency: N-hydroxy- 4-[(N(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-phenylacetamido)methyl)-benzamide)] (HPB), ACY-1215 (Ricolinostat), and ACY-1083. These structures reveal that an unusual monodentate Zn2+ coordination mode is exploited by sterically bulky HDAC6-selective phenylhydroxamate inhibitors. We additionally report the ultrahigh-resolution structure of the HDAC6-trichostatin A complex, which reveals two Zn2+-binding conformers for the inhibitor: a major conformer (70%) with canonical bidentate hydroxamate-Zn2+ coordination geometry and a minor conformer (30%) with monodentate hydroxamate-Zn2+ coordination geometry, reflecting a free energy difference of only 0.5 kcal/mol. The minor conformer is not visible in lower resolution structure determinations. Structural comparisons of HDAC6-inhibitor complexes with class I HDACs suggest active site features that contribute to the isozyme selectivity observed in biochemical assays.","Cancer chemotherapy; Drug discovery; Enzyme inhibitor; Metalloenzyme; Protein crystallography",Article,Scopus

They are a rare form of an appendiceal mass and develop from both benign and malignant processes. Mucoceles can develop secondarily to an obstruction, such as from a fecalith, scarring or, rarely, endometriosis. Only 12 cases of non-neoplastic appendiceal mucoceles caused by endometriosis have been previously described. The association between neoplastic appendiceal mucoceles in the presence of endometriosis is described for the first time in this report. Case presentation: A 57-year-old woman presented with a chief complaint of worsening abdominal pain over the past 3 months. Imaging studies revealed an appendiceal mass. Laparoscopic evaluation confirmed an appendiceal mucocele, and the patient underwent complete appendectomy. No evidence of mucinous or endometrial deposits were present within the abdominal cavity. Pathological diagnosis revealed low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) with evidence of endometriosis within the muscularis propria of the appendix. The patient recovered without complications and her abdominal pain completely resolved. Conclusions: Endometriosis of the appendix is a rare manifestation and is most often identified as an incidental finding. Endometriosis leading to an obstructive mucocele of the appendix is an exceedingly rare finding, having only been described 12 times in the medical literature. LAMN in the presence of endometriosis of the appendix is described for the first time in this report. The association between appendiceal neoplasms in the presence of endometriosis requires further research in order to optimize operative treatment. © 2017 The Author(s).","Endometriosis; Low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm; Mucocele; Pseudomyxoma peritonei",Article,Scopus

Predicting this drug's survival benefits is challenging because clinical responses are rarely measurable during treatment. In this study, we hypothesized that serum cytokines levels could predict the survival of advanced HCC patients, as sorafenib targets signaling pathways activated in the tumor stromal microenvironment and potentially affects serum cytokine profiles. Methods: Of 143 patients with advanced-stage HCC, 104 who were recruited between 2003 and 2007 received hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) that mainly targets tumor epithelial cells at S-phase (cohort 1); additionally, 39 recruited between 2010 and 2012 received sorafenib, which primarily targets the stromal vascular endothelial cells. Serum samples were collected and aliquoted prior to the treatment. Serum EGF, bFGF, HGF, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-12, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, MIG, PDGF-BB, SCF, SDF1, TGF-β, TGF-α, TNF-α, and VEGF-A were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors were used to assess tumor responses. Results: The median survival time of HCC patients in cohorts 1 (HAIC-treated) and 2 (sorafenib-treated) were 12.0 and 12.4 months, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no significant survival differences between the 2 groups. Patients who survived more than 2 years after sorafenib treatment exhibited higher serum levels of IL-10, IL-12, TNF-a, IL-8, SDF-1, EGF, PDGF-BB, SCF, and TGF-α. Furthermore, cohort 2 patients with higher serum IL-5 (>12 pg/mL), IL-8 (>10 pg/mL), PDGF-BB (>300 pg/mL), and VEGF-A (>50 pg/mL) levels achieved longer survival; cohort 1 patients did not. Hierarchical cluster analysis of 6 cytokines robustly enriched for comparison analysis between cohorts 1 and 2 (IL-5, IL-8, TGF-α, PDGF-BB, CXCL9, and VEGF-A) revealed that elevation of these cytokines correlated with better survival when treated with sorafenib but not with HAIC. Conclusions: Patients who exhibited survival benefits owing to sorafenib treatment tended to present higher serum cytokines levels, potentially reflecting the activation of stromal signaling in the tumor microenvironment. Our study thus introduces novel biomarkers that may identify advanced HCC patients who may experience survival benefits with sorafenib treatment. © 2017 The Author(s).","Chemokine; Cytokine; Growth factor; Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Sorafenib",Article,Scopus

Since dogs are an excellent outbred model for immunotherapy studies, we sought to assess RT plus local autologous NK transfer in canine sarcomas. Methods: Dog NK cells (CD5dim, NKp46+) were isolated from PBMCs and expanded with irradiated K562-C9-mIL21 feeder cells and 100 IU/mL recombinant human IL-2. NK homing and cytotoxicity ± RT were evaluated using canine osteosarcoma tumor lines and dog patient-derived xenografts (PDX). In a first-in-dog clinical trial for spontaneous osteosarcoma, we evaluated RT and intra-tumoral autologous NK transfer. Results: After 14 days, mean NK expansion and yield were 19.0-fold (±8.6) and 258.9(±76.1) ×106 cells, respectively. Post-RT, NK cytotoxicity increased in a dose-dependent fashion in vitro reaching ~ 80% at effector:target ratios of ≥10:1 (P&lt;0.001). In dog PDX models, allogeneic NK cells were cytotoxic in ex vivo killing assays and produced significant PDX tumor growth delay (P&lt;0.01) in vivo. After focal RT and intravenous NK transfer, we also observed significantly increased NK homing to tumors in vivo. Of 10 dogs with spontaneous osteosarcoma treated with focal RT and autologous NK transfer, 5 remain metastasis-free at the 6-month primary endpoint with resolution of suspicious pulmonary nodules in one patient. We also observed increased activation of circulating NK cells after treatment and persistence of labelled NK cells in vivo. Conclusions: NK cell homing and cytotoxicity are increased following RT in canine models of sarcoma.

A particular example of such a machine is a hadron therapy linac, which is a promising alternative to cyclic machines, traditionally used for cancer treatment. Currently, the practical utilization of linear accelerators in radiation therapy is limited by the requirement to be under 50 m in length. A usable device for cancer therapy should produce 200-250 MeV protons and/or 400-450 MeV/u carbon ions, which sets the requirement of having 35 MV/m average ""real-estate gradient"" or gradient per unit of actual accelerator length, including different accelerating sections, focusing elements and beam transport lines, and at least 50 MV/m accelerating gradients in the high-energy section of the linac. Such high accelerating gradients for ion linacs have recently become feasible for operations at S-band frequencies. However, the reasonable application of traditional S-band structures is practically limited to β=v/c>0.4. However, the simulations show that for lower phase velocities, these structures have either high surface fields (>200 MV/m) or low shunt impedances (<35 MΩ/m). At the same time, a significant (∼10%) reduction in the linac length can be achieved by using the 50 MV/m structures starting from β∼0.3. To address this issue, we have designed a novel radio frequency structure where the beam is synchronous with the higher spatial harmonic of the electromagnetic field. In this paper, we discuss the principles of this approach, the related beam dynamics and especially the electromagnetic and thermomechanical designs of this novel structure. Besides the application to ion therapy, the technology described in this paper can be applied to future high gradient normal conducting ion linacs and high energy physics machines, such as a compact hadron collider. This approach preserves linac compactness in settings with limited space availability. © 2017 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.",,Article,Scopus

We evaluated irAE reports related to high dose interleukin-2 therapy (IL-2) documented in the PROCLAIMSM registry data base from 2008 to 2016 (NCT01415167, August 9, 2011). Methods: Reports on 1535 patients, including 623 with metastatic melanoma (mM) and 919 with metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC) (7 patients had both diseases), were queried for irAEs. The timing of the event was categorized as occurring before, during or after IL-2 or related to any checkpoint inhibitor (CPI). mM patients and mRCC patients were analyzed separately. Tumor control [complete + partial response + stable disease (CR+PR+SD) was compared between those experiencing no irAE versus those with the development of irAEs. Survival was analyzed by tumor type related to timing of irAE and IL-2, and in those with or without exposure to CPI. Results: Median follow-up was 3.5+ years (range 1-8+ years), 152 irAEs were reported in 130 patients (8.4% of all PROCLAIMSM patients): 99 (16%) in mM and 53 (5.8%) in mRCC patients. 31 irAEs occurred prior to IL-2, 24 during IL-2, and 97 after IL-2 therapy. 74 irAEs were attributed to IL-2 only (during/ after IL-2). Of the 97 post IL-2 irAEs, 24 were attributed to CPI, and 15 could not be distinguished as caused by IL-2 or CPI. Tumor control was 71% for those experiencing irAE, and 56% for those with no irAE (p=0.0008). Overall survival was significantly greater for those experiencing irAEs during/ after IL-2 therapy, compared to those with no irAE or irAE before IL-2 therapy, in mM patients, median 48 months vs 18 months (p&lt;0.0001), and in mRCC patients, median 60 months vs 40 months (p=0.0302), independent of CPI-related irAEs. IL-2-related irAEs were primarily vitiligo and thyroid dysfunction (70% of IL-2 related irAEs), with limited further impact. Conclusions: irAEs following IL-2 therapy are associated with improved tumor control and overall survival. IrAEs resulting from IL-2 and from CPIs are qualitatively different, and likely reflect different mechanisms of action of immune activation and response. © 2017 The Author(s).","Immune-related adverse events; Interleukin-2; Melanoma; PROCLAIMSM; Renal cell carcinoma; Survival",Article,Scopus

We uncovered previously unreported phenotypic heterogeneity of human cDC2s among individuals, including variable expression of functional receptors such as CD172a. We found marked differences in DC subsets localized in blood and lymphoid tissues versus skin, and a striking absence of the newly discovered Axl+ DCs in the skin. Finally, we evaluated the capacity of anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies to deliver vaccine components to skin DC subsets. These results offer a promising path for developing DC subset-specific immunotherapies that cannot be provided by transcriptomic analysis alone.

This study aimed to measure DNA damage/repair markers in operators perfoming EVAR. Methods: Expression of the DNA damage/repair marker, γ-H2AX and DNA damage response marker, phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (pATM), were quantified in circulating lymphocytes in operators during the peri-operative period of endovascular (infrarenal, branched, and fenestrated) and open aortic repair using flow cytometry. These markers were separately measured in the same operators but this time wearing leg lead shielding in addition to upper body protection and compared with those operating with unprotected legs. Susceptibility to radiation damage was determined by irradiating operators' blood in vitro. Results: γ-H2AX and pATM levels increased significantly in operators immediately after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair (P<0.0003 for both). Only pATM levels increased after infrarenal endovascular aortic repair (P<0.04). Expression of both markers fell to baseline in operators after 24 hours (P<0.003 for both). There was no change in γ-H2AX or pATM expression after open repair. Leg protection abrogated γ-H2AX and pATM response after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair. The expression of γ-H2AX varied significantly when operators' blood was exposed to the same radiation dose in vitro (P<0.0001). Conclusions: This is the first study to detect an acute DNA damage response in operators performing fluoroscopically guided aortic procedures and highlights the protective effect of leg shielding. Defining the relationship between this response and cancer risk may better inform safe levels of chronic low-dose radiation exposure.","aortic aneurysm; DNA damage; endovascular; occupational exposure; radiation",Article,Scopus

In this paper, for the first time, we demonstrate that potentially harmful PLMs incur immense threats to the security of ML-powered systems. We present a general class of backdoor attacks in which maliciously crafted PLMs trigger host systems to malfunction in a predictable manner once predefined conditions are present. We validate the feasibility of such attacks by empirically investigating a state-of-the-art skin cancer screening system. For example, it proves highly probable to force the system to misdiagnose a targeted victim, without any prior knowledge about how the system is built or trained. Further, we discuss the root causes behind the success of PLM-based attacks, which point to the characteristics of today's ML models: High dimensionality, non-linearity, and non-convexity. Therefore, the issue seems industry-wide. © 2017 IEEE.",,Conference Paper,Scopus

Curcumin in water:ethanol (80:20) solution was physically adsorbed on the microspheres. The sustained release of curcumin from the microspheres was achieved. When injected the curcumin-adsorbed gelatin/silk fibroin (50/50) microspheres locally to the CaSki-induced tumor in BALB/c-nude mice, the tumor size reduction was clearly seen at 7-14 days after treatment, comparing to the groups treated with PBS and blank microspheres. The effect was possibly explained by the anti-angiogenesis of curcumin. However, the optimization of curcumin release rate and microspheres' degradation rate is necessary to obtain more therapeutic efficacy.

Mechanical forces play a critical role in cell differentiation, tissue organization and diseases such as cancer and heart disease; electrical fields are essential for intercellular communication, muscle contraction, neural signalling and sensory perception. Therefore, quantifying a biological system's forces and fields is crucial for understanding physiology and disease pathology and for developing medical tools for repair and recovery. This Review highlights advances in sensing mechanical forces and electrical fields in vivo, focusing on optical probes. The emergence of biocompatible optical probes, such as genetically encoded voltage indicators, molecular rotors, fluorescent dyes, semiconducting nanoparticles, plasmonic nanoparticles and lanthanide-doped upconverting nanoparticles, offers exciting opportunities to push the limits of spatial and temporal resolution, stability, multi-modality and stimuli sensitivity in bioimaging. We further discuss the materials design principles behind these probes and compare them across various metrics to facilitate sensor selection. Finally, we examine which advances are necessary to fully unravel the role of mechanical forces and electrical fields in vivo, such as the ability to probe the vectorial nature of forces, the development of combined force and field sensors, and the design of efficient optical actuators. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

The AMC-8 device with eight 70 MHz waveguides was designed to overcome this issue by improving power steering abilities compared to the four waveguide AMC-4 device. Four patients with pelvic malignancies were treated with this system. Each patient received 2-3 treatments using 4 waveguides and two treatments using 8 waveguides, all at a total power of 550W. Average steady state tumor temperatures T90 and T50 were 39.9°C and 41.3°C for 4 waveguides and 39.7°C and 41.4°C for 8 waveguides, respectively.

VDAC as the single most abundant protein in mitochondrial outer membranes is typically involved in isoform-specific interactions of the mitochondrion with its surroundings as, for example, during mitochondria-dependent pathways of cell death. VDAC closure can also act as an adjustable limiter (governator) of global mitochondrial metabolism, as during hepatic ethanol metabolism to promote selective oxidation of membrane-permeant acetaldehyde. In cancer cells, high free tubulin inhibits VDAC1 and VDAC2, contributing to suppression of mitochondrial function in the Warburg phenomenon. Erastin, the canonical inducer of ferroptosis, opens VDAC in the presence of tubulin and hyperpolarizes mitochondria, leading to mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death.

In this study, two heart-shaped glossy cabbage mutants were examined to determine their characteristics and potential practical applications. Firstly, mutant-type (MT) plants showed a shiny and attractive appearance, and the total wax load in MT leaves was significantly less than that of wild-type (WT) leaves, when assessed by scanning electron micrographs. Then, the results of χ2 tests on the separated proportion proved that the glossy wax-less trait is controlled by a single recessive gene. Unexpectedly, the sulforaphane content, which has been identified as a naturally potent anticarcinogen, showed an increasing trend in MT plants than the corresponding WT plants. Lastly, our work also showed that some genes that are involved in wax biosynthesis and export pathways are down-regulated in MT leaves, which could cause the glossy phenotype of MT plants.

The proposed approach approximate the L 0 optimization directly. Even though the original L 0 problem is non-convex, the problem is approximated by sequential convex optimizations with the proposed algorithm. The proposed method is easy to implement with only several lines of code. Novel adaptive ridge algorithms (L 0ADRIDGE) for L 0 penalized GLM with ultra high dimensional big data are developed. The proposed approach outperforms the other cutting edge regularization methods including SCAD and MC+ in simulations.

Among diverse factors that contribute to human aging, the mitochondrial dysfunction has emerged as one of the key hallmarks of aging process and is linked to the development of numerous age-related pathologies including metabolic syndrome, neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Mitochondria are central in the regulation of energy and metabolic homeostasis, and harbor a complex quality control system that limits mitochondrial damage to ensure mitochondrial integrity and function. The intricate regulatory network that balances the generation of new and removal of damaged mitochondria forms the basis of aging and longevity. Here, I will review our current understanding on how mitochondrial functional decline contributes to aging, including the role of somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial dynamics and quality control pathways. I will further discuss the emerging evidence on how dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of age-related disorders.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this randomized, open-label trial, 695 patients with glioblastoma whose tumor was resected or biopsied and had completed concomitant radiochemotherapy (median time from diagnosis to randomization, 3.8 months) were enrolled at 83 centers (July 2009-2014) and followed up through December 2016. A preliminary report from this trial was published in 2015; this report describes the final analysis. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 2:1 to TTFields plus maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy (n = 466) or temozolomide alone (n = 229). The TTFields, consisting of low-intensity, 200 kHz frequency, alternating electric fields, was delivered ( 18 hours/d) via 4 transducer arrays on the shaved scalp and connected to a portable device. Temozolomide was administered to both groups (150-200 mg/m2) for 5 days per 28-day cycle (6-12 cycles). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Progression-free survival (tested at ? = .046). The secondary end point was overall survival (tested hierarchically at ? = .048). Analyses were performed for the intent-to-treat population. Adverse events were compared by group. RESULTS Of the 695 randomized patients (median age, 56 years; IQR, 48-63; 473 men [68%]), 637 (92%) completed the trial. Median progression-free survival from randomization was 6.7 months in the TTFields-temozolomide group and 4.0 months in the temozolomide-alone group (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.52-0.76; P &lt; .001). Median overall survival was 20.9 months in the TTFields-temozolomide group vs 16.0 months in the temozolomide-alone group (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.53-0.76; P &lt; .001). Systemic adverse event frequency was 48% in the TTFields-temozolomide group and 44% in the temozolomide-alone group. Mild to moderate skin toxicity underneath the transducer arrays occurred in 52% of patients who received TTFields-temozolomide vs no patients who received temozolomide alone. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In the final analysis of this randomized clinical trial of patients with glioblastoma who had received standard radiochemotherapy, the addition of TTFields to maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy vs maintenance temozolomide alone, resulted in statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival. These results are consistent with the previous interim analysis. © 2017 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.",,Article,Scopus

Earlier studies suggested that the insulin gene promoter is uniquely unmethylated in insulin-expressing pancreatic β-cells, providing a classic example of this paradigm. Here we show that islet cells expressing insulin, glucagon, or somatostatin share a lack of methylation at the promoters of the insulin and glucagon genes. This is achieved by rapid demethylation of the insulin and glucagon gene promoters during differentiation of Neurogenin3+ embryonic endocrine progenitors, regardless of the specific endocrine cell-type chosen. Similar methylation dynamics were observed in transgenic mice containing a human insulin promoter fragment, pointing to the responsible cis element. Whole-methylome comparison of human α- and β-cells revealed generality of the findings: genes active in one cell type and silent in the other tend to share demethylated promoters, while methylation differences between α- and β-cells are concentrated in enhancers. These findings suggest an epigenetic basis for the observed plastic identity of islet cell types, and have implications for β-cell reprogramming in diabetes and diagnosis of β-cell death using methylation patterns of circulating DNA.","Development; DNA methylation; Epigenetic; Islets; β-cells",Article,Scopus

Accordingly, we harness analyte ""issues"" as exploitable advantages by our invention and characterization of the ""molecular gate,"" which controls and synchronizes formation of stretched DNA molecules as DNA dumbbells within nanoslit geometries. Molecular gate geometries comprise micro- and nanoscale features designed to synergize very low ionic strength conditions in ways we show effectively create an ""electrostatic bottle."" This effect greatly enhances molecular confinement within large slit geometries and supports facile, synchronized electrokinetic loading of nanoslits, even without dumbbell formation. Device geometries were considered at the molecular and continuum scales through computer simulations, which also guided our efforts to optimize design and functionalities. In addition, we show that the molecular gate may govern DNA separations because DNA molecules can be electrokinetically triggered, by varying applied voltage, to enter slits in a size-dependent manner. Lastly, mapping the Mesoplasma florum genome, via synchronized dumbbell formation, validates our nascent approach as a viable starting point for advanced development that will build an integrated system capable of large-scale genome analysis.","Devices; Genomics; Nanofluidics; Single DNA molecules",Article,Scopus

Previous studies reported that several members of Rab GTPase family are involved in the development of glioma, and abnormal expression of Rab small GTPases is known to cause aberrant tumor cell behavior. In this study, we characterized the roles of Rab21 (Rab GTPase 21), a member of Rab GTPase family, in glioma cells. Methods: The study involved downregulation of Rab21 in two glioma cell lines (T98G and U87) through transfection with specific-siRNA. Experiments using the MTT assay, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis assay, real-time PCR and western blot were performed to establish the expression levels of related genes. Results: The results show that downregulation of Rab21 can significantly inhibit cell growth and remarkably induce cell apoptosis in T98G and U87 cell lines. Silencing Rab21 resulted in significantly increased expression of apoptosis-related proteins (caspase7, Bim and Bax) in glioma cells. Conclusions: We inferred that Rab21 silencing can induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation in human glioma cells, indicating that Rab21 might act as an oncogene and serve as a novel target for glioma therapy. © 2017 The Author(s).","Apoptosis; Glioma; Proliferation; Rab21; RabGTPases",Article,Scopus

GBMs in the MES subclass are predominantly primary tumors that, compared to PN tumors, exhibit a worse prognosis; thus, understanding the mechanism of MES differentiation may be of great benefit for the treatment of GBM. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling is critically important in GBM, and activation of NF-κB could induce MES transdifferentiation in GBM, which warrants additional research. NUDT21 is a newly discovered tumor-associated gene according to our current research. The exact roles of NUDT21 in cancer incidence have not been elucidated. Here, we report that NUDT21 expression was upregulated in human glioma tissues and that NUDT21 promoted glioma cell proliferation, likely through the NF-κB signaling pathway. Gene set enrichment analysis, western blotting, and quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed that NF-κB inhibitor zeta (NFKBIZ) was a downstream target affected by NUDT21 and that the MES identity genes in glioblastoma cells, CHI3L1 and FN1, were also differentially regulated.

Accurately predicting the impact of vaccines that target multiple types requires understanding the factors that determine HPV diversity. The diversity of many pathogens is driven by type-specific or ""homologous"" immunity, which promotes the spread of variants to which hosts have little immunity. To test for homologous immunity and to identify mechanisms determining HPV transmission, we fitted nonlinear mechanistic models to longitudinal data on genital infections in unvaccinated men. Our results provide no evidence for homologous immunity, instead showing that infection with one HPV type strongly increases the risk of infection with that type for years afterward. For HPV16, the type responsible for most HPV-related cancers, an initial infection increases the 1-year probability of reinfection by 20-fold, and the probability of reinfection remains 14-fold higher 2 years later. This increased risk occurs in both sexually active and celibate men, suggesting that it arises from autoinoculation, episodic reactivation of latent virus, or both. Overall, our results suggest that high HPV prevalence and diversity can be explained by a combination of a lack of homologous immunity, frequent reinfections, weak competition between types, and variation in type fitness between host subpopulations. Because of the high risk of reinfection, vaccinating boys who have not yet been exposed may be crucial to reduce prevalence, but our results suggest that there may also be large benefits to vaccinating previously infected individuals.","Ecology; Infectious disease; Mathematical model; Public health; Vaccination",Article,Scopus

Results: The levels of ZBTB7A were effectively reduced in shRNA-CNE2 and shRNA-5-8F. Their carcinogenicity was stronger separately than the abilities of NC-CNE2 and NC-5-8F. NC-CNE2 and shRNA-CNE2 were selected to establish the xenograft model because of their stronger tumorigenicity than NC-6-10B and shRNA-5-8F.

DDR plays important roles in genome stability and cell cycle regulation, as well as in tumour transformation. Viruses have evolved successful life cycle strategies in order to ensure a chronic persistence in the host, virtually avoiding systemic sequelae and death. This process promotes the periodic shedding of large amounts of infectious particles to maintain a virus reservoir in individual hosts, while allowing virus spreading within the community. To achieve such a successful lifestyle, the human papilloma virus (HPV) needs to escape the host defence systems. The key to understanding how this is achieved is in the virus replication process that provides by itself an evasion mechanism by inhibiting and delaying the host immune response against the viral infection. Numerous studies have demonstrated that HPV exploits both the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia-telangiectasia and rad3-related (ATR) DDR pathways to replicate its genome and maintain a persistent infection by downregulating the innate and cell-mediated immunity. This review outlines how HPV interacts with the ATM-and ATR-dependent DDR machinery during the viral life cycle to create an environment favourable to viral replication, and how the interaction with the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) protein family and the deregulation of the Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT pathways may impact the expression of interferon-inducible genes and the innate immune responses. © 2017 by the authors.

These tests, especially mammalian cell assays, have high sensitivity but suffer from low specificity, leading to high rates of irrelevant positive findings (i.e., positive results in vitro that are not relevant to human cancer hazard). We developed an in vitro transcriptomic biomarker-based approach that provides biological relevance to positive genotoxicity assay data, particularly for in vitro chromosome damage assays, and propose its application for assessing the relevance of the in vitro positive results to carcinogenic hazard. The transcriptomic biomarker TGx-DDI (previously known as TGx-28.65) readily distinguishes DNA damage-inducing (DDI) agents from non-DDI agents. In this study, we demonstrated the ability of the biomarker to classify 45 test agents across a broad set of chemical classes as DDI or non-DDI. Furthermore, we assessed the biomarker's utility in derisking known irrelevant positive agents and evaluated its performance across analytical platforms. We correctly classified 90% (9 of 10) of chemicals with irrelevant positive findings in in vitro chromosome damage assays as negative. We developed a standardized experimental and analytical protocol for our transcriptomics biomarker, as well as an enhanced application of TGx-DDI for high-throughput cell-based genotoxicity testing using nCounter technology. This biomarker can be integrated in genetic hazard assessment as a follow-up to positive chromosome damage findings. In addition, we propose how it might be used in chemical screening and assessment. This approach offers an opportunity to significantly improve risk assessment and reduce cost.","DNA damage response; Genotoxicity; High-throughput screening; TGx-DDI; Transcriptomic biomarker",Article,Scopus

LncRNA microarray was used to screen the differently expressed lncRNAs. Small interfering RNA and Western blot were used to analyse the function and mechanism of the locked lncRNA. Results: HBx was negatively correlated with the epithelial marker E-cadherin but positively correlated with the mesenchymal marker vimentin in HCC tissues. HBx induced the mesenchymal phenotype and improved the metastatic ability of HCC cells. Meanwhile, HBx down-regulated E-cadherin, whereas it up-regulated vimentin. In HCC cells, HBx altered the expression of 2002 lncRNAs by more than 2-fold. One of them was ZEB2-AS1. Inhibition of ZEB2-AS1 can compensate for the EMT phenotype and reverse the expression of EMT markers regulated by HBx. Additionally, HBx affected the Wnt signalling pathway. Conclusions: HBx promotes HCC cell metastasis by inducing EMT, which is at least partly mediated by lncRNAs. © 2017 The Author(s).","Epithelial-mesenchymal transition; Hepatitis B virus x protein; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Long non-coding RNA; Metastasis",Article,Scopus

Elevated mammographic breast density (MBD) is an established breast cancer risk factor and is known to mask tumors within the dense tissue. However, the association of MBD with high risk benign breast disease (BBD) is unknown. Method: We analyzed data for 3400 women diagnosed with pathologically confirmed BBD in the Mayo Clinic BBD cohort from 1985-2001, with a clinical MBD measure (either parenchymal pattern (PP) or Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (BI-RADS) density) and expert pathology review. Risk factor information was collected from medical records and questionnaires. MBD was dichotomized as dense (PP classification P2 or DY, or BI-RADS classification c or d) or non-dense (PP classification N1 or P1, or BI-RADS classification a or b). Associations of clinical and histologic characteristics with MBD were examined using logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Of 3400 women in the study, 2163 (64%) had dense breasts. Adjusting for age and body mass index (BMI), there were positive associations of dense breasts with use of hormone therapy (HT), lack of lobular involution, presence of atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH), histologic fibrosis, columnar cell hyperplasia/flat epithelia atypia (CCH/FEA), sclerosing adenosis (SA), cyst, usual ductal hyperplasia, and calcifications. In fully adjusted multivariate models, HT (1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5), ALH (1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.2), lack of lobular involution (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1, compared to complete involution), fibrosis (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.9-2.6) and CCH/FEA (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.6) remained significantly associated with high MBD. Conclusion: Our findings support an association between high risk BBD and high MBD, suggesting that risks associated with the latter may act early in breast carcinogenesis. © 2017 The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

In fact, Trypanosoma and Leishmania parasites lack de novo purine pathways and rely on purine salvage pathways to meet their requirements. Herein, we propose the first comprehensive bioinformatic and structural characterization of the putative Leishmania infantum MTAP (LiMTAP), using a comparative computational approach. Results: Sequence analysis showed that LiMTAP shared higher identity rates with the Trypanosoma brucei (TbMTAP) and the human (huMTAP) homologs as compared to the human purine nucleoside phosphorylase (huPNP). Motifs search using MEME identified more common patterns and higher relatedness of the parasite proteins to the huMTAP than to the huPNP. The 3D structures of LiMTAP and TbMTAP were predicted by homology modeling and compared to the crystal structure of the huMTAP. These models presented conserved secondary structures compared to the huMTAP, with a similar topology corresponding to the Rossmann fold. This confirmed that both LiMTAP and TbMTAP are members of the NP-I family. In comparison to the huMTAP, the 3D model of LiMTAP showed an additional α-helix, at the C terminal extremity. One peptide located in this specific region was used to generate a specific antibody to LiMTAP. In comparison with the active site (AS) of huMTAP, the parasite ASs presented significant differences in the shape and the electrostatic potentials (EPs). Molecular docking of 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA) and 5′-hydroxyethylthio-adenosine (HETA) on the ASs on the three proteins predicted differential binding modes and interactions when comparing the parasite proteins to the human orthologue. Conclusions: This study highlighted significant structural peculiarities, corresponding to functionally relevant sequence divergence in LiMTAP, making of it a potential drug target against Leishmania. © 2017 The Author(s).","Antibody; Homology modeling; Leishmania; Molecular docking; MTAP",Article,Scopus

However, their physiological counterparts, ontogeny, transcriptional regulation, and heterogeneity remains largely unknown, hampering their clinical use. High-dimensional techniques were used to elucidate transcriptional, phenotypic, and functional differences between human in vivo and in vitro generated mononuclear phagocytes to facilitate their full potential in the clinic. We demonstrate that monocytes differentiated by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) resembled in vivo inflammatory macrophages, while moDCs resembled in vivo inflammatory DCs. Moreover, differentiated monocytes presented with profound transcriptomic, phenotypic, and functional differences. Monocytes integrated GM-CSF and IL-4 stimulation combinatorically and temporally, resulting in a mode- and time-dependent differentiation relying on NCOR2. Finally, moDCs are phenotypically heterogeneous and therefore necessitate the use of high-dimensional phenotyping to open new possibilities for better clinical tailoring of these cellular therapies. Monocyte-derived cellular derivatives are used clinically and are a crucial tool in basic research.

However, few studies have examined how the interplay between race and sexual orientation impacts a range of health measures in a nationally representative sample of the U.S. population. Methods: To address these gaps in the literature, we sought to investigate associations between sexual orientation identity and health/healthcare outcomes among U.S. women and men within and across racial/ethnic groups. Using 2013-2015 National Health Interview Survey data (N = 91,913) we employed Poisson regression with robust variance to directly estimate prevalence ratios (PR) comparing health and healthcare outcomes among SMs of color to heterosexuals of color and white heterosexuals, stratified by gender and adjusting for potential confounders. Results: The sample consisted of 52% women, with approximately 2% of each sex identifying as SMs. Compared to their heterosexual counterparts, white (PR = 1.25 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.45]) and black (1.54 [1.07, 2.20]) SM women were more likely to report heavy drinking. Hispanic/Latino SM women and men were more likely to experience short sleep duration compared to white heterosexual women (1.33 [1.06, 1.66]) and men (1.51 [1.21, 1.90). Black SM women had a much higher prevalence of stroke compared to black heterosexual women (3.25 [1.63, 6.49]) and white heterosexual women (4.51 [2.16, 9.39]). White SM women were more likely than white heterosexual women to be obese (1.31 [1.15, 1.48]), report cancer (1.40 [1.07, 1.82]) and report stroke (1.91 [1.16, 3.15]. White (2.41 [2.24, 2.59]), black (1.40[1.20, 1.63]), and Hispanic/Latino SM (2.17 [1.98, 2.37]) men were more likely to have been tested for HIV than their heterosexual counterparts. Conclusions: Sexual minorities had a higher prevalence of some poor health behaviors, health outcomes, and healthcare access issues, and these disparities differed across racial groups.

It is unclear if a cervical pessary can reduce the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery. OBJECTIVE To test whether in asymptomatic women with singleton pregnancies and no prior spontaneous preterm birth but with short cervical length on transvaginal ultrasound, use of a cervical pessary would reduce the rate of spontaneous preterm birth at less than 34 weeks of gestation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Parallel-group, nonblinded, randomized clinical trial conducted from March 1, 2016, to May 25, 2017, at a single center in Italy. Asymptomatic women with singleton gestations, no previous spontaneous preterm births, and cervical lengths of 25 mm or less at 18 weeks 0 days to 23 weeks 6 days of gestation were eligible. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either cervical pessary (n = 150) or no pessary (n = 150). The pessary was removed between 37 weeks 0 days and 37 weeks 6 days of gestation or earlier if clinically indicated. The control group received standard care. For cervical length of 20 mm or shorter, women in both groups were prescribed vaginal progesterone, 200 mg/d, until 36 weeks 6 days of gestation. No bed rest or activity restriction was recommended. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was spontaneous preterm birth at less than 34 weeks of gestation. Secondary outcomes were adverse events. RESULTS Among 300 women who were randomized (mean age, 29 [SD, 6.3] years; mean gestational age, 22 [SD, 1.3] weeks), 100% completed the trial. The primary end point occurred in significantly fewer women in the pessary group. During follow-up, the pessary group had a higher rate of increased or new vaginal discharge. No. (%) Between-Group Pessary Group Control Group Difference, % Relative Risk (n = 150) (n = 150) (95% CI) (95% CI) Primary outcome Spontaneous preterm 11 (7.3) 23 (15.3) ?8.0 (?15.7 to ?0.4) 0.48 (0.24-0.95) birth <34 wk Adverse events Vaginal discharge 130 (86.7) 69 (46.0) 40.7 (30.1 to 50.3) 1.88 (1.57-2.27) CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among women without prior spontaneous preterm birth who had asymptomatic singleton pregnancies and short transvaginal cervical length, use of a cervical pessary, compared with no pessary use, resulted in a lower rate of spontaneous preterm birth at less than 34 weeks of gestation.

However, the role of dialysis in survival and quality of life is unclear, and poor outcomes may be associated with comorbidities rather than with age only. The initiation of unplanned dialysis in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been reported to be associated with poor survival. We evaluated patient and practice factors associated with poor survival. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 90 consecutive elderly patients (≥75 years) with CKD initiated on long-term dialysis at our renal unit between October 2010 and February 2014. Six patients were excluded; data from 84 remaining patients (≥75 years) with end-stage renal disease undergoing planned or unplanned dialysis were analyzed. Patients were followed up until death or January 2015. Patient factors such as age at initiation of dialysis and comorbidities (i.e., diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease [IHD], peripheral vascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cognitive dysfunction) were analyzed. Practice factors such as planned or unplanned initiation of dialysis were compared in relation to survival outcomes. ""Unplanned dialysis"" was defined as a patient with known CKD stage 4 or 5 who had not been evaluated by a nephrologist in the 3 months before dialysis initiation. Results: The average age at dialysis initiation was 81.5 ± 4.5 years), serum albumin level was 24.8 ± 6 g/L, body mass index was 22.5 ± 4.8 kg/m 2 , and glycated hemoglobin A1c level was 6.3 ± 1.3. Overall, 51 (61%) and 33 (39%) patients underwent unplanned and planned dialysis, respectively. On univariate analysis, the presence of IHD, peripheral vascular disease, ≥3 comorbidities, and unplanned initiation of dialysis were significantly related to death. On multivariate analysis, unplanned start of dialysis, ischemic heart diseases and peripheral vascular disease remained significant. Survival rates at 3 and 12 months were 38.6% vs. 90.9% and 14.4% vs. 73.6% for unplanned vs. planned dialysis, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Unplanned dialysis was significantly associated with greater mortality. Conclusions: In elderly dialysis patients, unplanned start of dialysis was associated with poor survival.

Our group previously explored their antiplatelet effects. This study was designed to confirm inhibition effects of PM21 (a 2:1 mixture of bamboo leaf extract and Japanese apricot fruit extract) on platelet aggregation and evaluate its potency to use as an herbal remedy to prevent and/or treat the diseases caused by platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. Methods: Washed platelets were prepared and platelet aggregation was induced by adding 5 μg/mL collagen. Anti-platelet effects of PM21 (75 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg, and 300 mg/kg for ex vivo and in vivo assays, and 50, 100, 200 μg/mL for in vitro assays) were evaluated. In ex vivo assays, PM21 was orally administered to rats daily after overnight fasting for 3 days and blood was collected 1 h after the final treatment. In vivo antithrombotic effect of PM21 was observed from a carrageenan induced mouse tail thrombosis model. Results: In ex vivo assay, PM21 inhibited platelet aggregation significantly. PM21 showed a strong antithrombotic effect by reducing significantly the length of mouse tail thrombus. PM21 increased intracellular cAMP level and reduced the release of ATP, TXA2, and serotonin. PM21 also reduced intracellular concentration of calcium ion, fibrinogen binding to integrin αIIbβ3, and phosphorylation of ERK2, p38, PLCγ2, and PI3 K. Conclusions: PM21 showed remarkable inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. Its inhibitory function seems to influence on GPVI binding to its ligand and subsequent initiation of a signaling cascade that involves activation of effector proteins and secretion of effector molecules, such as ATP, TXA2, serotonin, and Ca2+. PM21 also appears to exert its anti-platelet effect by deactivation of ERKs activation pathway as well as inhibition of fibrinogen binding to integrin αIIbβ3. © 2017 The Author(s).","Anti-platelet aggregation; Anti-thrombosis; Bamboo leaf; Japanese apricot fruit; Phyllostachys pubescens; Prunus mume",Article,Scopus

Pre- and intra-renal AKI biomarkers have recently been reported. Recovery from AKI by herbal medicine has rarely been reported. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the dose- and time-dependent effects of herbal medicines to protect against AKI in cisplatin-induced human kidney 2 (HK-2) cells by assessing the activities of high-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1). Methods: Proximal tubular HK-2 cell lines were treated with either 400 μM of cisplatin for 6 h or 10 μM of cisplatin for 24 h and then exposed to ten types of single herbal medicines, including Nelumbo nymphaea (NY) at a dose of 100 μg/mL. The AKI biomarkers HMGB1, NGAL and KIM-1 were repeatedly measured by an ELISA assay at 2, 4, and 6 h in the group treated with 400 μM of cisplatin to confirm necrotic cell death and at 6, 24, and 48 h in the group treated with 10 μM of cisplatin to examine apoptotic cell death. Recovery confirm was conducted through in vivo study using ICR mice for 3 day NY or Paeonia suffruticosa intake. Results: Cisplatin treatment at a concentration of 10 μM decreased cell viability. Treatment with 400 μM of cisplatin reduced HMBG1 activity and resulted in lactate dehydrogenase release. In longer exposure durations (up to 48 h), NGAL and KIM-1 exhibited activity from 24 h onward. Additionally, NY treatment resulted in an approximately 50% change in all three biomarkers. The time-dependent profiles of HMGB1, NGAL and KIM-1 activities up to 48 h were notably different; HMGB1 exhibited a 7-fold change at 6 h, and NGAL and KIM-1 exhibited 1.7-fold changes at 24 h, respectively. Consistently, serum and urine NGAL and KIM-1 activities were all reduced in ICR mice. Conclusions: Several single herbal medicines, including NY, have a potential as effectors of AKI due to their ability to inhibit the activation of HMGB1, NGAL and KIM-1 in an in vitro AKI-mimicked condition and simple in vivo confirm. Furthermore, an in vivo proof-of-concept study is needed. © 2017 The Author(s).","Acute kidney injury; Herbal medicine; High-mobility group box protein 1; Kidney injury molecule-1; Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin",Article,Scopus

Some studies have indicated that the rs738409 polymorphism of the PNPLA3 gene is associated with steatosis and the progression of advanced fibrosis. This study assessed the contribution of the PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism with regard to the steatosis and degree of liver fibrosis in Brazilian patients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C. Methods: A total of 290 patients were evaluated at the Clinics Hospital of the School of Medicine, University of São Paulo, between 2010 and 2015. The inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years and positive anti-HCV antibody and HCV RNA tests. The participants were evaluated based on medical consultation, blood tests, and liver biopsies conducted before specific antiviral therapies were applied. The associations between the rs738409 PNPLA3 gene polymorphism and steatosis and advanced fibrosis were tested under a recessive inheritance model using logistic regression analysis, including age, gender, BMI, ethnicity/color, HOMA-IR, alcohol intake, HCV genotype 3, and the rs58542926 TM6SF2 gene polymorphism as covariates. Results: The mean age of the patients was 54.9 years old (range, 28 to 82 years), and 124 (42.8%) patients were male, 226 (77.9%) were white, 43 (14.8%) were pardo, and 21 (7.2%) were black Brazilians. Of the patients included in this study, 133 (45.9%) presented with the CC genotype, 63 (21.7%) with the CG genotype, and 94 (32.4%) with the GG genotype of the PNPLA3 gene I148M variant. We observed that the associations between PNPLA3 rs738409 GG genotype and steatosis was significant (OR: 2.16; 95% CI 1.26-3.72). The same genotype was associated to advanced fibrosis too (OR:2.64; 95% CI 1.26-5.53). Conclusions: Associations between the rs738409 polymorphism of the PNPLA3 gene genotype GG and hepatic steatosis and advanced fibrosis were observed. Studies are still needed to clarify the influence of these polymorphisms on hepatic steatosis and degree of fibrosis among individuals diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C. © 2017 The Author(s).","Brazil; Fibrosis; Hepatitis C; PNPLA3; Polymorphism rs58542926; Polymorphism rs738409; Steatosis; TM6SF2",Article,Scopus

Hence, we performed this updated and cumulative meta-analysis to ascertain a more accurate association between CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism and risk of cervical cancer. Methods: Studies involving the CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism associated with cervical cancer risk were searched from the databases of PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The strength of correlation was evaluated through calculating summary odds ratios (ORs) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Subgroup analyses according to ethnicity, source of control and HWE were completed to further explore specific association between the polymorphism and the cancer risk. Results: Altogether, 11 eligible case-control studies were ultimately encompassed into the current meta-analysis, with 1,932 patients and 2,039 healthy controls. The total analysis revealed a borderline relationship between CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism and cervical cancer risk in general population.

However, this link was mostly based on body weight or BMI rather than body-fat. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between body-fat gain and disease progression in Taiwanese women after breast cancer surgery and how this relationship is influenced by menopausal status. Methods: Body fat percentage was measured 1 day before and 6 months after surgery in 131 women with stages 0-III breast cancer. Disease outcomes (metastasis and death) were assessed by chart review and telephone contact 7 to 8 years after diagnosis. These data were analyzed by multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analysis. Results: The percentage of women with over 5% gain in body-fat was 56% for premenopausal and 42% for postmenopausal. Rates of distant metastasis and all-cause mortality were 17.6 and 9.9%, respectively over the follow-up period. Distant metastases were predicted in postmenopausal but not premenopausal women with breast cancer by increased body fat percentage (HR = 1.3, p = 0.035), after controlling other potential covariates, including disease severity, estrogen receptor expression, progesterone receptors expression, age, and exercise habit before diagnosis. Survival was not significantly associated with body-fat percentage gains. Conclusions: Our results suggest that increased body fat percentage 6 months after breast surgery is an important predictor of distant metastasis in postmenopausal Taiwanese women with breast cancer. Clinicians may need to measure patients' body fat periodically. Our findings should be validated in studies with a longer follow-up time. © 2017 The Author(s).","Body fat; Breast cancer; Disease progression; Menopausal status",Article,Scopus

Health fairs are a common community outreach strategy used to provide cancer-related health education and services. Methods: This study was a process evaluation of seven health fairs focused on cancer screening across the U.S. We conducted key-informant interviews with the fair coordinator and conducted baseline and follow-up surveys with fair participants to describe characteristics of participants as well as their experiences. We collected baseline data with participants at the health fairs and telephone follow-up surveys 6 months following the fair. Results: Attendance across the seven health fairs ranged from 41 to 212 participants. Most fairs provided group or individual education, print materials and cancer screening during the event. Overall, participants rated health fairs as very good and participants reported that the staff was knowledgeable and that they liked the materials distributed. After the fairs, about 60% of participants, who were reached at follow-up, had read the materials provided and had conversations with others about cancer screening, and 41% talked to their doctors about screening. Based on findings from evaluation including participant data and coordinator interviews, we describe 6 areas in planning for health fairs that may increase their effectiveness. These include: 1) use of a theoretical framework for health promotion to guide educational content and activities provided, 2) considering the community characteristics, 3) choosing a relevant setting, 4) promotion of the event, 5) considerations of the types of services to deliver, and 6) evaluation of the health fair. Conclusions: The events reported varied in reach and the participants represented diverse races and lower income populations overall. Most health fairs offered education, print materials and onsite cancer screening. Participants reported general satisfaction with these events and were motivated through their participation to read educational materials or discuss screening with providers.

It can start in the breast and can spread to other areas of the body in the course of time. Breast cancer is the second largest disease leading to the death of women. The disease is curable if detected early enough. A lot of research is being done to detect the cancer at the earliest. Early detection at the microcalcification stage can be useful for providing proper treatment at the early stage and saving the patients. Research on breast cancer using digital image processing is not new but lack of proper methods for early detection at microcalcification stage is still a challenge to medical domain and still it is considered as the deadliest. Most of the research work done till now detects the breast cancer at tumor stage and are not accurate to 100% and leads to false positive or false negative results which are highly dangerous. And also they do not provide end to end solution. A novel methodology is proposed in this paper to detect breast asymmetry and microcalcification cancer cells using a combination of different highly efficient techniques of digital image processing which are not yet being implemented in this research area.

Herein, we present an advanced computational data extraction approach which can identify the presence of prostate cancer in men with PSA levels &lt; 20 ng ml-1 on the basis of peripheral blood immune cell profiles that have been generated using multi-parameter flow cytometry. Statistical analysis of immune phenotyping datasets relating to the presence and prevalence of key leukocyte populations in the peripheral blood, as generated from individuals undergoing routine tests for prostate cancer (including tissue biopsy) using multi-parametric flow cytometric analysis, was unable to identify significant relationships between leukocyte population profiles and the presence of benign disease (no prostate cancer) or prostate cancer. By contrast, a Genetic Algorithm computational approach identified a subset of five flow cytometry features (CD8+CD45RA-CD27-CD28- (CD8+ Effector Memory cells); CD4+CD45RA-CD27-CD28- (CD4+ Terminally Differentiated Effector Memory Cells re-expressing CD45RA); CD3-CD19+ (B cells); CD3+CD56+CD8+CD4+ (NKT cells)) from a set of twenty features, which could potentially discriminate between benign disease and prostate cancer. These features were used to construct a prostate cancer prediction model using the k-Nearest-Neighbor classification algorithm. The proposed model, which takes as input the set of flow cytometry features, outperformed the predictive model which takes PSA values as input. Specifically, the flow cytometry-based model achieved Accuracy = 83.33%, AUC = 83.40%, and optimal ROC points of FPR = 16.13%, TPR = 82.93%, whereas the PSA-based model achieved Accuracy = 77.78%, AUC = 76.95%, and optimal ROC points of FPR = 29.03%, TPR = 82.93%. Combining PSA and flow cytometry predictors achieved Accuracy = 79.17%, AUC = 78.17% and optimal ROC points of FPR = 29.03%, TPR = 85.37%. The results demonstrate the value of computational intelligence-based approaches for interrogating immunophenotyping datasets and that combining peripheral blood phenotypic profiling with PSA levels improves diagnostic accuracy compared to using PSA test alone. These studies also demonstrate that the presence of cancer is reflected in changes in the peripheral blood immune phenotype profile which can be identified using computational analysis and interpretation of complex flow cytometry datasets. © 2017 Cosma, McArdle, Reeder, Foulds, Hood, Khan and Pockley.","Computational analysis; Flow cytometry; Genetic algorithm; Immunophenotyping data; Machine learning; Predictive modeling; Prostate cancer; PSA level",Article,Scopus

Endowed with the ability to orchestrate an all-encompassing immune response, iNKT cells are critical in shaping immune responses against pathogens and cancer cells. In this review, we examine the critical role of iNKT cells in antitumor responses from two perspectives: (i) how iNKT cells potentiate antitumor immunity and (ii) how CD1d+ tumor cells may modulate their own expression of CD1d molecules.

This review attempted to bring forward and introduce the novel therapeutic opportunities of using genetically engineered MSCs. The simplicities and advantages of MSCs for medical applications make them a unique and promising option in the case of cancer therapy. Some of the superiorities of using MSCs as therapeutic gene micro-carriers are the easy cell-extraction procedures and their abundant proliferation capacity in vitro without losing their main biological properties. Targeted therapy by using MSCs as the delivery vehicles of therapeutic genes is a new approach in the treatment of various types of cancers. Some of the distinct properties of MSCs, such as tumor-tropism, non-immunogenicity, stimulatory effect on the anti-inflammatory molecules, inhibitory effect on inflammatory responses, non-toxicity against the normal tissues, and easy processes for the clinical use, have formed the basis of attention to MSCs. They can be easily used for the treatment of damaged or injured tissues, regenerative medicine, and immune disorders. This review focused on the drugability of MSCs and their potential for the delivery of candidate anticancer genes. It also briefly reviewed the vectors and methods used for MSC-mediated gene therapy of malignancies. Also, the challenges, limitations, and considerations in using MSCs for gene therapy of cancer and the new methods developed for resolution of these problems are reviewed. © 2017 Marofi, Vahedi, Biglari, Esmaeilzadeh and Athari.","Cancer; Cell therapy; Gene therapy; Mesenchymal stem cells; Vector",Review,Scopus

As such, cancer expression of claudin proteins is markedly dysregulated, making it an attractive target for molecular imaging like positron emission tomography (PET). Claudins are a family of transmembrane proteins that have a pivotal role as members of the tight junctions. In particular, claudin-3 and claudin-4 are frequently overexpressed in pancreatic cancer.18F-Labeled claudin selective peptides would provide access to a novel kind of imaging tools for pancreatic cancer. In this work we describe the synthesis of the first18F-labeled probes potentially suitable for PET imaging of claudin-4 expression. These probes were prepared using oxime ligation of 5-[18F]fluoro-5-deoxyribose (5-[18F]FDR) to claudin selective peptides. As a proof-of-principle, one of them, 5-[18F]FDR-Clone 27, was isolated in &gt;98% radiochemical purity and in 15% radiochemical yield (EOB) within 98 min, and with a molar activity of 4.0 GBq/µmol (for 30 MBq of tracer). Moreover, we present first biological data for the prepared 5-FDR-conjugates. These tracers could pave the way for an early diagnosis of pancreatic tumor, and thus improve the outcome of anticancer therapy. © 2017 by the authors.

Extracellular vesicles called exosomes are also implicated in cancer metastasis. Here, we demonstrate that exosome production is strongly reduced in cells lacking Atg5 and Atg16L1, but this is independent of Atg7 and canonical autophagy. Atg5 specifically decreases acidification of late endosomes where exosomes are produced, disrupting the acidifying V1V0-ATPase by removing a regulatory component, ATP6V1E1, into exosomes. The effect of Atg5 on exosome production promotes the migration and in vivo metastasis of orthotopic breast cancer cells. These findings uncover mechanisms controlling exosome release and identify means by which autophagy-related genes can contribute to metastasis in autophagy-independent pathways. Guo et al. demonstrate that, independent of canonical autophagy, Atg5 and Atg16L1 de-acidify multivesicular bodies via V1V0-ATPase control to induce exosome release and promote cancer cell metastasis. This reveals mechanisms governing exosome release and suggests that some effects of Atg5 and Atg16L1 in disease are mediated by exosomes rather than autophagy. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","acidification; autophagy; cancer; endosome; exosomes; extracellular vesicles; LC3; multivesicular body; tumor; V1V0-ATPase",Article,Scopus

The importance of the therapeutic area between tumor suppression and normal tissue injury has long been highlighted in radiation therapy. Recent advances in stem cell biology have shown that stem cell (SC) responses to genotoxic stresses of ionizing radiation can improve the therapeutic effect of radiation by repairing damaged cells. In contrast, cancer stem cells (CSCs), a small subpopulation of cells within tumors, are generally resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and cause tumor recurrence. Although the underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood in detail, efforts are still underway to identify SC treatment or CSC resistant pathogenesis of DNA damage agents such as radiation therapy. In response to radiation, CSCs differ from normal SCs in their biological properties due to severe deregulation of the self-renewal ability in CSCs. Differences of cleavage mode, cell cycle characteristics, replication potential, and activation/inactivation of DNA damage treatment and cancer-specific molecular pathways between normal SCs and CSCs confer a malignant phenotype upon CSCs. However, further studies are needed to identify normal SC and CSC-specific targets. In this review, we summarize the current advances in research regarding how normal SCs and CSCs respond to ionizing radiation, with a special emphasis on cell toxicity, radiosensitivity, signaling networks, DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA repair. In addition, we discuss strategies to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques for predicting responses to cancer treatment and overcoming radiation-related toxicity. © 2017 by the authors.

METHODS Peripheral venous blood was collected from 62 patients with colorectal cancer who were treated with capecitabine alone or combined with chemotherapy. Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral venous blood to genotype ENOSF1 single nucleotide polymorphisms rs2612091, IVS10-61C&gt;T, IVS10- 60G&gt;A, and rs1059394 by sequencing. The toxic reactions of capecitabine were recorded, and their relationship with different genotypes was compared. RESULTS According to the level of toxic reactions, the patients were divided into two groups: patients with grade 0-1 toxicities and those with grade 2-4 toxicities. ENOSF1 genotypes were divided into a dominant model and a recessive model. In the dominant model, the risk of grade 2-4 hand-foot syndrome in patients with IVS10- 60G&gt;A GG genotype was significantly higher than that in patients with AG/AA genotype (χ2 = 5.421, P = 0.020, OR = 4.364, 95%CI: 1.217-15.641). In the recessive model, the risk of grade 2-4 diarrhea in patients with IVS10-61C&gt;T TT genotype was significantly higher than that in patients with CC/CT genotype (Fisher’s exact test: P = 0.817, OR = 0.108, 95%CI: 0.015-0.788).

Melanoma accounts for 5-10% of metastatic/secondary orbital malignancies, but only a tiny proportion of primary orbital neoplasia. Primary orbital melanoma (POM) is exceedingly rare, with approximately 50 cases reported to date. Methods: All patients seen in the orbital unit at a tertiary referral hospital (1991-2016) with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of POM were identified from a diagnostic database and were studied. The case notes, imaging, surgical approach, and histology were reviewed. Results: Thirteen patients (five male; 38%) presented with isolated malignant melanoma of the orbit, for which no other primary site was identified at presentation or during an average follow-up of 44 months (median 22; range 0-13 years). The patients presented between the ages of 40 and 84 years (mean 55.5; median 48 years) and typically gave a short history of rapidly increasing proptosis and eyelid swelling. On the basis of history, a malignant lesion was suspected in most patients and all underwent incisional biopsy, with debulking of the mass in 10 (77%) patients, and skin-sparing exenteration in 3/13 (23%). Ten patients underwent orbital radiotherapy and the survival to date ranged from 9 months to 14 years (mean 55 months; median 23 months); two patients received solely palliative care for widespread disease and one patient refused orbital radiotherapy. Five of the 13 (38%) patients died from the disease. Discussion: POM is a very rare malignancy, but clinical analysis of this cohort gives insight into disease presentation and prognosis. The tumor typically presents with a rapidly progressive, well-defined mass that is, in some cases, amenable to macroscopically intact excision. Unusual for malignant melanoma, some of these patients can show an unusually long period of quiescent disease after surgical debulking and radiotherapy. © 2017 Rose, Luthert, Jayasena, Verity and Rose.","Melanoma; Ocular melanoma; Orbital malignancy; Orbital surgery; Primary orbital melanoma",Article,Scopus

In turn, defects in vitamin D receptor signaling or vitamin D status can lead to numerous clinical disorders such as osteomalacia, alopecia, increased cancer prevalence, and compromised immune and wound repair responses. In recent years it has become evident that microRNAs (miRNAs) are important mediators of vitamin D signaling. miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that orchestrate dynamic posttranscriptional regulatory networks. Not only do miRNAs impact vitamin D signaling but vitamin D also regulates miRNA networks during homeostasis and disease across species. Although improved methods have identified a diverse set of miRNAs that provide a better understanding of genome regulation, the ultimate goal is to go beyond profiling toward miRNA-based transformative clinical applications for vitamin D-regulated disorders and conditions. In this chapter we acknowledge and discuss the dynamic and emerging interactions between miRNAs and the vitamin D signaling system. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, here we bring in the concept of decade old 'Reverse Current Technology', wherein the direction of a current could be reversed without altering its magnitude. Identifying the magnitude and direction of the current passing through the cancerous cells, and applying this concept would help in suppressing this favorable condition for the tumor. This concept is backed by the fact that, the electric field produced by a current in one particular direction will be opposite to the electric field produced by the same current in the reverse direction.

In the first stage, cancer will spread to one extra-lymphatic organ or site and in remaining stages it will spread to another part of the human body. In this work, we develop a computational tool for predicting the appropriate drug at accurate dosage for each stage of Lymphoma. We are going to apply ten to twenty Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma drugs which are taken from drug bank. Using alignment method we are predicting the stages of lymphoma, once the sequence is aligned high matches and less number of mismatches, gap, deletion and insertion can be considered as stage 1. According to the result obtained, we consider the people affected by four stages of Lymphoma and then predict the protein structural changes in each person. Simultaneously, multiple drug interact and the result is analyzed. If the obtained result has high binding affinity in docking, then the drug is adaptable for that stage.

New therapies offer exciting prospects for improved survival, but the development of resistance is a major problem and there remains a need for additional effective melanoma therapy. Platinum compounds, such as cisplatin, are the most effective chemotherapeutics for a number of major cancers, but are ineffective on metastatic melanoma. They cause monofunctional adducts and intrastrand crosslinks that are repaired by nucleotide excision repair, as well as the more toxic interstrand crosslinks that are repaired by a combination of nuclease activity and homologous recombination. Methods: We investigated the mechanism of melanoma resistance to cisplatin using a panel of melanoma and control cell lines. Cisplatin-induced changes in levels of the key homologous recombination protein RAD51 and compensatory changes in translesion synthesis DNA polymerases were identified by western blotting and qRT-PCR. Flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and western blotting were used to compare the cell cycle and DNA damage response and the induction of apoptosis in cisplatin-treated melanoma and control cells. Ectopic expression of a tagged form of RAD51 and siRNA knockdown of translesion synthesis DNA polymerase zeta were used to investigate the mechanism that allowed cisplatin-treated melanoma cells to continue to replicate. Results: We have identified and characterised a novel DNA damage response mechanism in melanoma. Instead of increasing levels of RAD51 on encountering cisplatin-induced interstrand crosslinks during replication, melanoma cells shut down RAD51 synthesis and instead boost levels of translesion synthesis DNA polymerase zeta to allow replication to proceed. This response also resulted in synthetic lethality to the PARP inhibitor olaparib. Conclusions: This unusual DNA damage response may be a more appropriate strategy for an aggressive and rapidly growing tumour like melanoma that enables it to better survive chemotherapy, but also results in increased sensitivity of cultured melanoma cells to the PARP inhibitor olaparib. © 2017 The Author(s).","Chemotherapy; Cisplatin; DNA polymerase zeta; DNA repair; Melanoma; PARP inhibitor; RAD51; Synthetic lethality; Translesion synthesis",Article,Scopus

METHODS Two hundred and seventy patients with benign and malignant hepatobiliary system diseases (hepatolithiasis, liver abscess, choledocholithiasis, cholecystitis, primary hepatocellular carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma) treated at our hospital from February 2015 to February 2017 were included. The levels of a-fetoprotein (AFP), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen19-9 (CA19-9), and cancer antigen 125 (CA125) were detected in all patients by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and their value in disease diagnosis and curative effect monitoring was assessed. RESULTS There was no significant difference in serum levels of tumor markers between the normal control group and the benign liver disease group (P > 0.05). The levels of tumor markers in the malignant hepatobiliary disease group were significantly higher than those in the benign liver disease group (P < 0.05). In malignant liver diseases, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of AFP were the highest among all single detections; compared with single detection, the sensitivity of combined detection was increased significantly (P < 0.05), but the specificity and accuracy were decreased (P > 0.05). In malignant biliary diseases, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CA19-9 were the highest among all single detections; compared with single detection, the sensitivity of combined detection was increased significantly (P < 0.05), but the specificity and accuracy were decreased (P > 0.05). Compared with the values before treatment, the levels of AFP, CEA, CA19-9, and CA125 in patients with malignant hepatobiliary diseases significantly decreased after treatment (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Compared with single detection, the combined detection of tumor markers can significantly improve the value of diagnosis and curative effect monitoring in benign and malignant diseases of the hepatobiliary system. © The Author(s) 2017.

The presence of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and enzymes involved in activation and inactivation of vitamin D in testis and human spermatozoa supports a role in reproduction. In this chapter, functional and clinical studies investigating the role of vitamin D in male reproduction will be discussed. VDR is expressed in immature Sertoli cells, germ cells, Leydig cells, human spermatozoa, and the epithelial cells lining the male reproductive tract so the effects on male reproduction are multifaceted. The specific vitamin D effects are difficult to assess especially in humans due to the close link between vitamin D and calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Here, we try to discriminate direct versus indirect effects. Vitamin D seems to exert a positive effect on semen quality, sperm function, estrogen signaling, and testicular cancer.

Many of above-mentioned studies aimed to optimize the cultivation conditions. Factors like the light intensity and quality, the nitrogen source, or different modes of growth (auto-, hetero-, or mixotrophic) have been studied in detail. The scaling-up of the biomass production using photobioreactors, either closed or open, was also investigated to increase the production of useful compounds. The richness of nutrients contained in the genus Arthrospira can be used for promising applications in the biomedical domain. Ingredients such as the calcium spirulan, immulina, C-phycocyanin, and γ-linolenic acid (GLA) show a strong biological activity.

Consistent with this, phosphorylated 4EBP1 levels were elevated in HH signaling-driven medulloblastomas in mice and humans. In mice, an mTORC1 inhibitor suppressed medulloblastoma driven by a mutant SMO that is inherently resistant to existing SMO inhibitors, prolonging the survival of the mice. Our study reveals that mTORC1-mediated translation is a key component of HH signaling and an important target for treating medulloblastoma and other cancers driven by HH signaling. Wu et al. show that Hedgehog (HH) signaling promotes protein synthesis via a non-canonical, mTORC1/4EBP1-dependent pathway and that mTORC1/4EBP1-dependent translation is a prerequisite for canonical HH signaling. They show further that inhibition of mTORC1 signaling suppresses HH-dependent cerebellar growth and the development of HH-driven medulloblastoma. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","4EBP1; brain tumor; cerebellum; granule neuron; Hedgehog; medulloblastoma; mTOR; mTORC1; Smoothened; translation",Article,Scopus

We recently adapted a commercial silica-based column kit used in genomics to manually isolate DNA under mild conditions from FFPE tissues of rodents and humans and successfully measured DNA adducts of several carcinogens including aristolochic acid I (AA-I), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) (Yun et al.

The DNA retrieval methodology is robust; however, the procedure is time-consuming and labor intensive, and not amenable to rapid throughput processing. In this study, we have employed the Promega Maxwell 16 MDx system, which is commonly used in large scale genomics studies, for the rapid throughput extraction of DNA. This system streamlines the DNA isolation procedure and increases the sample processing rate by about 8-fold over the manual method (32 samples versus 4 samples processed per hour). High purity DNA is obtained in satisfactory yield for the measurements of DNA adducts by ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray-ionization-ion trap-multistage scan mass spectrometry. The measurements show that the levels of DNA adducts of AA-I, 4-ABP, and PhIP in FFPE rodent and human tissues are comparable to those levels measured in DNA from matching tissues isolated by the commercial silica-based column kits and in DNA from fresh frozen tissues isolated by the conventional phenol-chloroform extraction method. The isolation of DNA from tissues is one major bottleneck in the analysis of DNA adducts. This rapid throughput methodology greatly decreases the time required to process DNA and can be employed in large-scale epidemiology studies designed to assess the role of chemical exposures and DNA adducts in cancer risk. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,Article,Scopus

Its proliferation and differentiation are regulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) and calcium acting through their respective receptors, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the calcium-sensing receptor. The keratinocyte makes its own 1,25(OH)2D from the vitamin D produced in the skin. The epidermis maintains a steep calcium gradient with highest concentration in the stratum granulosum. VDR and CYP27B1 have their highest expression in the stratum basale. Calcium and 1,25(OH)2D have overlapping and generally synergistic effects on keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. Control of the different stages of differentiation is mediated in part via the differential distribution of coactivators. In the absence of VDR the epidermis is prone to tumor formation through a number of mechanisms including loss of the E-cadherin/catenin complex important for calcium signaling, decreased DNA damage repair, activation of Hedgehog signaling, and abnormalities in beta-catenin signaling. Similarly loss of VDR in conjunction with low calcium reduces stem cell activation thus delaying the epidermal response to wounding.

Chemical and virus induction are two major risk factors, however, the potential molecular mechanisms of their differences remain elusive. In this study, to identify the similarities and differences between chemical and virus induced HCC models, we compared the gene expression profiles between DEN and HBx mice models, as well as the differences among tumor, para-tumor and normal tissues. Methods: We sequenced both gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression for HCC tumor tissues, para-tumor and normal liver tissues from DEN model mice (30-week-old) and downloaded the corresponding microarray expression data of HBx model from GEO database. Then differentially expressed genes (DEGs), miRNAs and transcription factors (TFs) were detected by R packages and performed functional enrichment analysis. To explore the gene regulatory network in HCC models, miRNA and TF regulatory networks were constructed by target prediction. Results: For model comparison, although DEGs between tumor and normal tissues in DEN and HBx models only had a small part of overlapping, they shared common pathways including lipid metabolism, oxidation-reduction process and immune process. For tissue comparisons in each model, genes in oxidation-reduction process were down-regulated in tumor tissues and genes in inflammatory response showed the highest expression level in para-tumor tissues. Genes highly expressed in both tumor and para-tumor tissues in two models mainly participated in immune and inflammatory response. Genes expressed in HBx model were also involved in cell proliferation and cell migration etc. Network analysis revealed that several miRNAs such as miR-381-3p, miR-142a-3p, miR-214-3p and TFs such as Egr1, Atf3 and Klf4 were the core regulators in HCC. Conclusions: Through the comparative analyses, we found that para-tumor tissue is a highly inflammatory tissue while the tumor tissue is specific with both inflammatory and cancer signaling pathways. The DEN and HBx mice models have different gene expression pattern but shared pathways.

Efficient lysophagy is ensured by additional layers of regulation, including modulation by the ubiquitin-directed AAA-ATPase VCP/p97. Lysophagy shares many features with mitophagy, the macroautophagic removal of damaged mitochondria.

The reversal of DNA methylation, or DNA demethylation, is mediated by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) protein family of dioxygenases. Although it has been widely reported that aberrant DNA methylation and demethylation are associated with developmental defects and cancer, how these epigenetic changes directly contribute to the subsequent alteration in gene expression or disease progression remains unclear, largely owing to the lack of reliable tools to accurately add or remove DNA modifications in the genome at defined temporal and spatial resolution.

Here, we describe methods for introducing a chemical-inducible epigenome remodeling tool (CiDER), based on an engineered split-TET2 enzyme, into mammalian cells and quantifying the chemical inducible production of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) with immunostaining, flow cytometry or a dot-blot assay.

Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective long-term treatment for obesity. In addition to weight loss, bariatric surgery produces additional health benefits such as remission of type 2 diabetes, remission of hypertension, and decreased risk of developing certain types of cancer. The mechanisms beyond weight loss for these benefits remain incompletely defined. Therefore, animal models of bariatric surgery are being developed and validated to identify the mechanisms leading to these benefits, with the goal of improving understanding of gastrointestinal physiology and identifying new therapeutic targets. VSG has become the most commonly performed bariatric procedure in the clinic in the United States because it is highly effective at producing weight loss and metabolic improvement, and is simpler to perform than other bariatric procedures. Therefore, we have developed and validated a murine model of VSG. This murine VSG model recapitulates many of the effects of VSG seen in humans, including improved glucose and blood pressure regulation. The method is based on isolation of the stomach, ligation of gastric vessels, and removal of 70% of the stomach by transecting along the greater curvature of the stomach. We have successfully applied this surgical protocol to various genetically modified mouse lines to define the mechanistic contributors to the benefits of VSG. Furthermore, this murine VSG model has been combined with other surgical techniques, to achieve deeper mechanistic insight. Therefore, this is a simple and versatile model for studying gastrointestinal physiology and the health benefits of bariatric surgery. © 2017 Journal of Visualized Experiments.","Biomedical Engineering; Diabetes; Issue 130; Mouse; Murine; Obesity; Type 2 diabetes; Vertical sleeve gastrectomy",Article,Scopus

Integrity of endothelial cells also play a prominent role in the outcome of surgical procedures and organ transplant. Endothelial barrier function and integrity are regulated by a plethora of highly specialized transmembrane receptors, including claudin family proteins, occludin, junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs), vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, and the newly identified immunoglobulin (Ig) and proline-rich receptor-1 (IGPR-1) through various distinct mechanisms and signaling. On the other hand, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its tyrosine kinase receptor, VEGF receptor-2, play a central role in the destabilization of endothelial barrier function. While claudins and occludin regulate cell-cell junction via recruitment of zonula occludens (ZO), cadherins via catenin proteins, and JAMs via ZO and afadin, IGPR-1 recruits bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 [also called dystonin (DST) and SH3 protein interacting with Nck90/WISH (SH3 protein interacting with Nck)]. Endothelial barrier function is moderated by the function of transmembrane receptors and signaling events that act to defend or destabilize it. Here, I highlight recent advances that have provided new insights into endothelial barrier function and mechanisms involved.

Although several reports have proposed potential therapeutic agents, no effective treatments have been found for muscle atrophy. We searched for myogenic modulators from medicinal plants to treat muscle diseases. We isolated six alkaloids from Corydalis turtschaninovii and evaluated their myogenic potential by using the MyoD reporter gene assay in C2C12 cells. Among the tested compounds, canadine showed the strongest transactivation of MyoD and increased MHC expression during myogenesis. The activation of p38 MAP kinase and Akt are major mechanisms that contribute to the myogenesis by canadine. Canadine increased the number of multinucleated and cylinder-shaped myotubes during myogenesis of C2C12 myoblasts. To determine the preventive effect of canadine in cancer-induced muscle wasting, differentiated C2C12 myotubes were treated with conditioned media from CT26 colon carcinoma culture (CT26 CM) in the presence of canadine.

The attribution method has been proposed to identify which conditions contribute most to disability using cross-sectional data. Although the original method was based on binary outcomes, we recently proposed an extension to multinomial responses, since different disability levels are often investigated in surveys. This is the first application of the extended method to evaluate differences in the contribution of chronic conditions to functional limitations in the older population of Brazil and Belgium. Methods: Representative data from individuals aged ≥65 years who participated in the 2008 or 2013 Health Interview Surveys in Belgium (N = 4521) or in the 2008 National Household Sample Survey in Brazil (N = 28,437) were analysed. Individuals were classified as without, moderate or severe functional limitations, based on three activities of daily living: eating, showering, and toileting. Six chronic conditions common to the surveys - diabetes, heart diseases, musculoskeletal conditions, depression, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancer - were included in the analysis. Separate multinomial additive hazards models by gender for each country were fitted. Results: The prevalence of moderate functional limitations was larger in men in Brazil (8.4%) compared to Belgium (6.0%) and similar in women (approximately 12.0%). Conversely, the severe prevalence in men was similar in the two countries (around 8.0%) and higher in women from Belgium (16.6%) than from Brazil (9.1%). Musculoskeletal conditions were the main contributors to the prevalence of functional limitations in men and women in Belgium but only in men and women with moderate functional limitations in Brazil. Depression and heart diseases contributed most to the severe prevalence of functional limitations in men and women in Brazil, respectively. Conclusions: Our findings provide a better understanding of differences in the prevalence of different levels of functional limitations in Brazil and Belgium. These differences can be related to differences in socioeconomic conditions, health care access and quality, disease diagnosis, stage of epidemiology transition, life expectancy, and the prevalence of lifestyle risk factors in the two countries. © 2017 The Author(s).","ADL; Belgium; Brazil; Chronic conditions; Functional limitations; Multinomial; Survey",Article,Scopus

While bisphosphonates are shown to be effective in reducing vertebral fractures and pain, their role in improving overall survival (OS) remains unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2002 and previously updated in 2010 and 2012. Objectives: To assess the evidence related to benefits and harms associated with use of various types of bisphosphonates (aminobisphosphonates versus non-aminobisphosphonates) in the management of patients with MM. Our primary objective was to determine whether adding bisphosphonates to standard therapy in MM improves OS and progression-free survival (PFS), and decreases skeletal-related morbidity. Our secondary objectives were to determine the effects of bisphosphonates on pain, quality of life, incidence of hypercalcemia, incidence of bisphosphonate-related gastrointestinal toxicities, osteonecrosis of jaw (ONJ) and hypocalcemia. Search methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase (September 2011 to July 2017) and the CENTRAL (2017, Issue 7) to identify all randomized controlled trial (RCT) in MM up to July 2017 using a combination of text and MeSH terms. Selection criteria: Any randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing bisphosphonates versus placebo/no treatment/bisphosphonates and observational studies or case reports examining bisphosphonate-related ONJ in patients with MM were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors extracted the data. Data were pooled and reported as hazard ratio (HR) or risk ratio (RR) using a random-effects model. We used meta-regression to explore statistical heterogeneity. Network meta-analysis using Bayesian approach was conducted. Main results: In this update, we included four new studies (601 participants), resulting in a total of 24 included studies. Twenty RCTs compared bisphosphonates with either placebo or no treatment and four RCTs involved another bisphosphonate as a comparator. The 24 included RCTs enrolled 7293 participants. Pooled results showed that there was moderate-quality evidence of a reduction in mortality with on OS from 41% to 31%, but the confidence interval is consistent with a larger reduction and small increase in mortality compared with placebo or no treatment (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.07; 14 studies; 2706 participants). There was substantial heterogeneity among the included RCTs (I2 = 65%) for OS. To explain this heterogeneity we performed a meta-regression assessing the relationship between bisphosphonate potency and improvement in OS, which found an OS benefit with zoledronate but limited evidence of an effect on PFS. This provided a further rationale for performing a network meta-analyses of the various types of bisphosphonates that were not compared head-to-head in RCTs. Results from network meta-analyses showed evidence of a benefit for OS with zoledronate compared with etidronate (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.87) and placebo (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.91). However, there was no evidence for a difference between zoledronate and other bisphosphonates. The effect of bisphosphonates on disease progression (PFS) is uncertain. Based on the HR of 0.75 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.00; seven studies; 908 participants), 47% participants would experience disease progression without treatment compared with between 30% and 47% with bisphosphonates (low-quality evidence). There is probably a similar risk of non-vertebral fractures between treatment groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.56; six studies; 1389 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Pooled analysis demonstrated evidence for a difference favoring bisphosphonates compared with placebo or no treatment on prevention of pathological vertebral fractures (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.89; seven studies; 1116 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and skeletal-related events (SREs) (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88; 10 studies; 2141 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The evidence for less pain with bisphosphonates was of very low quality (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.95; eight studies; 1281 participants). Bisphosphonates may increase ONJ compared with placebo but the confidence interval is very wide (RR 4.61, 95% CI 0.99 to 21.35; P = 0.05; six studies; 1284 participants; low-quality evidence). The results from the network meta-analysis did not show any evidence for a difference in the incidence of ONJ (eight RCTs, 3746 participants) between bisphosphonates. Data from nine observational studies (1400 participants) reported an incidence of 5% to 51% with combination of pamidronate and zoledronate, 3% to 11% with zoledronate alone, and 0% to 18% with pamidronate alone. The pooled results showed no evidence for a difference in increase in frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms with the use of bisphosphonates compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.59; seven studies; 1829 participants; low-quality evidence).The pooled results showed no evidence for a difference in increase in frequency of hypocalcemia with the use of bisphosphonates compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 2.19, 95% CI 0.49 to 9.74; three studies; 1090 participants; low-quality evidence). The results from network meta-analysis did not show any evidence for differences in the incidence of hypocalcemia, renal dysfunction and gastrointestinal toxicity between the bisphosphonates used. Authors' conclusions: Use of bisphosphonates in participants with MM reduces pathological vertebral fractures, SREs and pain. Bisphosphonates were associated with an increased risk of developing ONJ. For every 1000 participants treated with bisphosphonates, about one patient will suffer from the ONJ. We found no evidence of superiority of any specific aminobisphosphonate (zoledronate, pamidronate or ibandronate) or non-aminobisphosphonate (etidronate or clodronate) for any outcome. However, zoledronate was found to be better than placebo and first-generation bisposphonate (etidronate) in pooled direct and indirect analyses for improving OS and other outcomes such as vertebral fractures. Direct head-to-head trials of the second-generation bisphosphonates are needed to settle the issue if zoledronate is truly the most efficacious bisphosphonate currently used in practice. © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

As a result, prostate cancer cells harboring SPOP mutations are more resistant to BET inhibitors. Therefore, our results help to elucidate the tumor suppressor role of SPOP in the prostate cancer setting by negatively controlling BET proteins stability. More importantly, our results also provide a molecular basis for using combination with BET inhibitors and other inhibitors to treat prostate cancer patients with SPOP mutations. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","BET; Cell proliferation; Resistance; SPOP; Ubiquitin",Article,Scopus

In this study, we demonstrate that Pfn1 overexpression reduces the stem-like phenotype (a key biologic feature associated with higher tumor-initiating potential) of MDA-MB-231 (MDA-231) triple-negative breast cancer cells. Interestingly, the stem-like trait of MDA-231 cells is also attenuated upon depletion of Pfn1. A comparison of cancer stem cell gene (CSC) gene expression signatures between depleted and elevated conditions of Pfn1 further suggest that Pfn1 may be somehow involved in regulating the expression of a few CSC-related genes including MUC1, STAT3, FZD7, and ITGB1. Consistent with the reduced stem-like phenotype associated with loss-of-function of Pfn1, xenograft studies showed lower tumor-initiating frequency of Pfn1-depleted MDA-231 cells compared to their control counterparts. In MMTV:PyMT mouse model, homozygous but not heterozygous deletion of Pfn1 gene leads to severe genetic mosaicism and positive selection of Pfn1-proficient tumor cells further supporting the contention that a complete lack of Pfn1 is likely not conducive for efficient tumor initiation capability of breast cancer cells. In summary, these findings suggest that the maintenance of optimal stemness and tumor-initiating ability of breast cancer cells requires a balanced expression of Pfn1. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Breast cancer; Profilin1; stemness; tumorigenicity",Article,Scopus

It has been shown that patients with higher resilience have better quality of life. Social support systems are important protective factors that are necessary for the process of resilience to occur. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the role of social support in the relationship between resilience and quality of life among Chinese patients with breast cancer. Material/Methods: A demographic-disease survey, the Chinese version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 25, Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Breast Cancer Version 3 were used to interview 98 patients with breast cancer from a teaching hospital in Chongqing, China. Data analysis was performed by descriptive statistics, independent-sample t test, one-way ANOVA, and regression analyses. Results: The mean scores of resilience, social support, and quality of life were 54.68, 61.73, and 80.74 respectively, which were in the moderate range. Participants with stronger social support had higher resilience and better quality of life. Social support played a partial mediator role in the relationship between resilience and quality of life. The mediation effect ratio was 28.0%. Conclusions: Social support is essential for the development of resilience and the improvement of quality of life in Chinese patients with breast cancer.

CVD and cancer share risk factors such as obesity and diabetes mellitus and have common diagnostic biomarkers such as interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein. Thus, timely and accurate diagnosis of these two correlated diseases is of high interest to both the research and healthcare communities. Most conventional methods for CVD and cancer biomarker detection such as microwell plate-based immunoassay and polymerase chain reaction often suffer from high costs, low test speeds, and complicated procedures. Recently, lab-on-a-chip (LoC)-based platforms have been increasingly developed for CVD and cancer biomarker sensing and analysis using various molecular and cell-based diagnostic biomarkers. These new platforms not only enable better sample preparation, chemical manipulation and reaction, high-throughput and portability, but also provide attractive features such as label-free detection and improved sensitivity due to the integration of various novel detection techniques. These features effectively improve the diagnostic test speed and simplify the detection procedure. In addition, microfluidic cell assays and organ-on-chip models offer new potential approaches for CVD and cancer diagnosis. Here we provide a mini-review focusing on recent development of LoC-based methods for CVD and cancer diagnostic biomarker measurements, and our perspectives of the challenges, opportunities and future directions. © 2017, MDPI AG.

The functions and related mechanism of FBXW7 controlled lung cancer stem cells' signatures is barely unknown, and the miR-367 regulations of FBXW7 via Wnt signaling have not been explored. Cancer stem cells of either ALDH1+ or CD133+ phenotype were found to be referred to advanced stages in patients with NSCLC (non-small cell lung carcinoma). To study the roles of miR-367, we found greater miR-367 level or FBXW7 level was reserved in NSCLC than that of paired adjacent normal tissues, and their upregulations were positively correlated with Wnt signaling activation. On the contrary, increased miR-367 was correlated with Let-7 repression. MiR-367 was related to stronger sphere forming ability in stem cells of NSCLC. We then explored the functions of the endogenous miR-367 in stem-like cells isolated from NSCLC cell lines. In HEK-293 cells, we identified FBXW7 as the direct downstream gene of miR-367, which consequently released the LIN-28 dependent inhibition of suppressive Let-7. Through informatics analysis, miR-367 was predicated to function through Wnt signaling, and decreased Let-7 played the pivotal role to maintain TCF-4/Wnt pathway activity. The reintroduction of FBXW7 abolished the oncogenic stimulation of miR-367 on TCF-4 activity, with Wnt signaling factors depression. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated the oncogenic roles of miR-367 exerting on the self-renewal ability of cancer stem-like cells through degrading the suppressive FBXW7, eventually helping to maintain Wnt signaling activation through a LIN28B/Let-7 dependent manner. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Cancer stem cells; FBXW7; Let-7; MiR-367; Wnt signaling",Article,Scopus

Here, we used tandem ubiquitin-binding entities (TUBEs) to analyze the ubiquitylation pattern observed in MCF7 or MCF7ADR cells. While in MCF7, the level of total ubiquitylation increased up to six-fold in response to ADR, in MCF7ADR cells only a two-fold response was found. To further explore these differences, we looked for cellular factors presenting ubiquitylation defects in MCF7ADR cells. Among them, we found the tumor suppressor p53 and its ubiquitin ligase, Mdm2. We also observed a drastic decrease of proteins known to integrate the TUBE-associated ubiquitin proteome after ADR treatment of MCF7 cells, like histone H2AX, HMGB1 or β-tubulin. Only the proteasome inhibitor MG132, but not the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine partially recovers the levels of total protein ubiquitylation in MCF7ADR cells. p53 ubiquitylation is markedly increased in MCF7ADR cells after proteasome inhibition or a short treatment with the isopeptidase inhibitor PR619, suggesting an active role of these enzymes in the regulation of this tumor suppressor. Notably, MG132 alone increases apoptosis of MCF7ADR and multidrug resistant ovarian cancer A2780DR1 and A2780DR2 cells. Altogether, our results highlight the use of ubiquitylation defects to predict resistance to ADR and underline the potential of proteasome inhibitors to treat these chemoresistant cells. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Adriamycin; breast cancer; chemoresistance; degradation; ovarian cancer; p53; proteasome; TUBEs; Ubiquitylation",Article,Scopus

In this study, we established NVP-BEZ235, a potent dual kinase inhibitor, could induce neuroblastoma cells proliferation inhibition without apoptosis activation. Moreover, we showed NVP-BEZ235 could induce neuroblastoma cells arrested at G0/G1 phase accompanied with significant reduction of the cyclin D1 and E1 proteins in a dose dependent manner at nanomole concentration. Additionally we found that GSK3β was dephosphorylated and activated by NVP-BEZ235 and then triggered cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 degradation through ubiquitination proteasome pathway, based on the evidences that NVP-BEZ235 induced downregulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 were obviously recovered by proteasome inhibitor and the blockade of GSK3β contributed to remarkable rescue of cyclin D1 and cyclin E1. Analogous results about its anti-proliferation effects and molecular mechanism were observed on neuroblastoma xenograft mouse model in vivo. Therefore, these results indicate that NVP-BEZ235-induced cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 degradation, which happened through activating GSK3β, and GSK3β-dependent down-regulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 should be available for anticancer therapeutics. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","cyclin D1; cyclin E1; GSK3β; neuroblastoma; NVP-BEZ235",Article,Scopus

Temozolomide (TMZ) is the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent in gliomas. However, therapeutic benefits of TMZ could be very limited and all patients would finally suffer from tumor progression as the tumors develop resistance to TMZ. In this study, we aim to investigate the underlying mechanism of chemoresistance in glioma cell line and to identify whether there is still a close link between epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and TMZ resistance in gliomas. The real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to measure the expression of EMT markers in TMZ-resistant cells. The migration and invasion assays were conducted to detect the cell motility activity in TMZ-resistant cells. The transfection was used to down-regulate the Cdc20 expression. The student t-test was applied for data analysis. We established stable TMZ-resistant glioma cells and designated as TR. Our results revealed that TR cells exhibited a significantly increased resistance to TMZ compared with their parental cells. Moreover, TMZ-resistant cells had acquired EMT-like changes. For the mechanism study, we measured a significant increased expression of CDC20 and decreased expression of Bim in TR cells. Moreover, upon suppression of CDC20 by shRNA transfection, TR cells underwent a reverse of EMT features. Importantly, knockdown of CDC20 enhanced the drug sensitivity of TR cells to TMZ. Our results suggested that inactivation of CDC20 could contribute to the future therapy that possibly overcomes drug resistance in human cancers. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Cdc20; Chemoresistance; EMT; Glioma; Temozolomide",Article,Scopus

Several studies demonstrated that citrinin exerts cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in both in vivo and in vitro systems. However, the precise mechanisms of action (MOA), particularly in intestinal cells remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine the precise MOA of citrinin in vitro. Data demonstrated that CTN significantly decreased the number of viable human intestinal HCT116 cells and induced apoptotic events including (1) decrease in ΔѰm indicative of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, (2) activation of caspase 3, (3) elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and (4) relative persistence of plasma membrane integrity. Further, the genetic deficiency of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax protected cells against CTN-induced apoptosis, indicating that Bax is required for CTN-mediated toxicity. It was also found that CTN triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activated different arms of the unfolded protein response (UPR) as demonstrated by increase in expression of GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein-78), GRP94 (glucose-regulated protein-94), GADD34 (growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein-34), the protein disulfide isomerase associated 6 (PDIA6), CHOP (C/EBP-homologous protein) and the splicing of XBP1 (X-Box Binding Protein 1). Pretreatment of cells with the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA), known to alleviate ER stress, prevented significantly the apoptotic process triggered by CTN. Taken together, these results suggest that CTN exerts its cytotoxic effects in HCT116 cells by inducing apoptosis, at least in part, through induction of ER stress. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,Article,Scopus

An understanding of the mechanism(s) underlying silica-induced pulmonary toxicity is critical for the intervention and/or prevention of its adverse health effects. Rats were exposed by inhalation to crystalline silica at a concentration of 15 mg/m3, 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 3, 6 or 12 weeks. Pulmonary toxicity and global gene expression profiles were determined in lungs at the end of each exposure period. Crystalline silica was visible in lungs of rats especially in the 12-week group. Pulmonary toxicity, as evidenced by an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and albumin content and accumulation of macrophages and neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), was seen in animals depending upon silica exposure duration. The most severe histological changes, noted in the 12-week exposure group, consisted of chronic active inflammation, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, and fibrosis. Microarray analysis of lung gene expression profiles detected significant differential expression of 38, 77, and 99 genes in rats exposed to silica for 3-, 6-, or 12-weeks, respectively, compared to time-matched controls. Among the significantly differentially expressed genes (SDEG), 32 genes were common in all exposure groups. Bioinformatics analysis of the SDEG identified enrichment of functions, networks and canonical pathways related to inflammation, cancer, oxidative stress, fibrosis, and tissue remodeling in response to silica exposure.

Colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer in men and women, after prostate and breast cancer, respectively, with a median age of 72years at diagnosis. Statins induce mitochondrial damage leading to accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the cell. Reactive oxygen species can cause mutations in mitochondrial as well as nuclear DNA leading to the development of cancer. Our hypothesis was that statins increase the risk for colorectal cancer. Methods: A case study was performed on consecutive cases of colorectal cancer diagnosed at Norrlands University Hospital (NUS) in Umeå between 2012 and 2015 (n=325). Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type II (DM II n=65) were excluded in the primary endpoint analysis (occurrence of colorectal cancer). As control, three databases were used to create an age-matched population in order to calculate the proportion of inhabitants using statins in the county of Västerbotten, Sweden. A secondary endpoint was cancer-specific survival among our study group of colorectal cancer patients, including those with DM II, investigating whether there was a difference if the patient was a 'recent' statin user or not at the time of diagnosis. Results: Statin use at the time of colorectal cancer diagnosis in the study group was 23.8%. The corresponding figure in an age-matched population in Västerbotten was 24.6%. Using a one-proportional one-sided z test, there was no significant difference between these (23.8%, 95% CI 18.6-29.0%, p=0.601). When comparing groups 20-64years of age, the difference was greater with recent statin use in 17.8% in the study population and 11.9% in Västerbotten (17.8%, 95% CI 9.0-26.6%, p=0.059). When considering cancer-specific survival, no significant difference in survival was seen when comparing 'former/never' statin users as reference category with 'recent' users diagnosed with colorectal cancer (HR 1.39, 95% CI 0.89-2.16). Conclusions: No significant increase in risk for developing colorectal cancer among patients (type II diabetics excluded) medicated with statins was found. We found no correlation between 'recent' statin use at the time of diagnosis and cancer-specific survival. © 2017 The Author(s).","Colorectal cancer; Diabetes mellitus; Mitochondrial DNA damage; Reactive oxygen species; Risk factor; Statin",Article,Scopus

The liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry technique using highly-selective multiple reaction monitoring mode and labeled internal standards for each analyzed compound was applied. Performed statistical analyses showed that amino acids are potentially useful as OC biomarkers, especially as variables in multi-marker models.

The TF/VIIa complex acts as the main initiator of the clotting cascade in blood and a trigger of intracellular signaling that changes gene expression and the cellular phenotype. However, pathways mediating these changes are still poorly characterized and especially the impact of TF signals on regulatory microRNA (miR) networks in cancer remains unknown. We show that the monoclonal antibody that selectively neutralises the signaling (but not coagulant) function of human TF (CNTO 2559) inhibits progression of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenografts in mice and prolongs animal survival. CNTO 2559 blocks FVIIa-induced expression of interleukin 8 (IL-8) by cancer cells without impacting factor Xa (FXa) generation.

Personalised ovarian cancer risk prediction, based on genetic and epidemiological information and risk stratified management in adult women could improve outcomes. Examining health care professionals' (HCP) attitudes to ovarian cancer risk stratified management, willingness to support women, self-efficacy (belief in one's own ability to successfully complete a task), and knowledge about ovarian cancer will help identify training needs in anticipation of personalised ovarian cancer risk prediction being introduced. Methods: An anonymous survey was distributed online to HCPs via relevant professional organisations in the UK. Kruskal-Wallis tests and pairwise comparisons were used to compare knowledge and self-efficacy scores between different types of HCPs, and attitudes toward population-based genetic testing and risk stratified management were described. Content analysis was undertaken of free text responses concerning HCPs willingness to discuss risk management options with women. Results: One hundred forty-six eligible HCPs completed the survey: oncologists (31%); genetics clinicians (30%); general practitioners (22%); gynaecologists (10%); nurses (4%); and 'others'. Scores for knowledge of ovarian cancer and genetics, and self-efficacy in conducting a cancer risk consultation were generally high but significantly lower for general practitioners compared to genetics clinicians, oncologists, and gynaecologists. Support for population-based genetic testing was not high (<50%). Attitudes towards ovarian cancer risk stratification were mixed, although the majority of participants indicated a willingness to discuss management options with patients. Conclusions: Larger samples are required to investigate attitudes to population-based genetic testing for ovarian cancer risk and to establish why some HCPs are hesitant to offer testing to all adult female patients. If ovarian cancer risk assessment using genetic testing and non-genetic information including epidemiological information is rolled out on a population basis, training will be needed for HCPs in primary care to enable them to provide appropriate support to women at each stage of the process. © 2017 The Author(s).","Genetic testing; Health care professionals; Ovarian cancer; Risk stratification",Article,Scopus

We found that inherent risk was predicted by body mass index (BMI) and dense area (DA) or percent dense area (PDA), but not by non-dense area (NDA). Masking, however, was best predicted by PDA but not BMI. In this study, we aimed to investigate if these associations vary by tumor characteristics and mode of detection. Methods: We conducted a case-control study nested within the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study of 244 screen-detected cases matched to 700 controls and 148 interval cases matched to 446 controls. DA, NDA and PDA were measured using the Cumulus software. Tumor characteristics included size, grade, lymph node involvement, and ER, PR, and HER2 status. Conditional and unconditional logistic regression were applied as appropriate to estimate the Odds per Adjusted Standard Deviation (OPERA) adjusted for age and BMI, allowing the association with BMI to be a function of age at diagnosis. Results: For screen-detected cancer, both DA and PDA were associated to an increased risk of tumors of large size (OPERA ~ 1.6) and positive lymph node involvement (OPERA ~ 1.8); no association was observed for BMI and NDA. For risk of interval versus screen-detected breast cancer, the association with risk for any of the three mammographic measures did not vary by tumor characteristics; an association was observed for BMI for positive lymph nodes (OPERA ~ 0.6). No associations were observed for tumor grade and ER, PR and HER2 status of tumor. Conclusions: Both DA and PDA were predictors of inherent risk of larger breast tumors and positive nodal status, whereas for each of the three mammographic density measures the association with risk of masking did not vary by tumor characteristics. This might raise the hypothesis that the risk of breast tumours with poorer prognosis, such as larger and node positive tumours, is intrinsically associated with increased mammographic density and not through delay of diagnosis due to masking. © 2017 The Author(s).","Breast cancer; Detection mode; Mammographic density; Tumor characteristics",Article,Scopus

Here, we aimed to determine the downstream genes of PLK1 and their effects on the carcinogenesis and progression of bladder cancer. Methods: Specific siRNA was utilized to silence the target gene expression. The cell proliferation, invasion and migration of bladder cancer cells by MTT assay, BrdU assay and transwell assay. The differential expression genes were identified using Affymetrix HTA2.0 Array. The KEGG, GO and STRING analysis were used to analyze the signaling pathway and protein-protein interaction. Spearman analysis was used to analyze the correlation between protein and protein, between protein and clincopathologic characteristics. Results: PLK1 siRNA hindered the proliferation, invasion and migration of bladder cancer cells, as determined by the MTT, BrdU and transwell assays. A total of 561 differentially expressed genes were identified using an Affymetrix HTA2.0 Array in PLK1 knockdown T24 cells. According to KEGG, GO and STRING analysis, five key genes (BUB1B, CCNB1, CDC25A, FBXO5, NDC80) were determined to be involved in cell proliferation, invasion and migration. PLK1 knockdown decreased BUB1B, CCNB1, CDC25A and NDC80 expressions but increased FBXO5 expression. BUB1B, CCNB1, CDC25A and NDC80 were positively correlated with cell proliferation, invasion, migration and PLK1 expression in tissues, but FBXO5 was negatively correlated with each of those factors. The results showed that the five genes expressions were significantly correlation with the PLK1 expression in normal bladder tissues and bladder cancer tissues. Four of them (BUB1B, CCNB1, CDC25A, NDC80) were obviously positive correlations with pT stage and metastasis. But FBXO5 was negative correlated with pT stage and metastasis. Furthermore, significant correlations were found between CCNB1 or CDC25A or NDC80 and histological grade; between BUB1B or NDC80 and recurrence. Conclusion: Five downstream genes of PLK1 were associated with the regulation of cell proliferation, invasion and migration in bladder cancer. Furthermore, these genes may play important roles in bladder cancer and become important biomarkers and targets for cancer treatment. © 2017 The Author(s).","Bladder cancer; BUB1B; CCNB1; CDC25A; FBXO5; Go; KEGG; NDC80; PLK1",Article,Scopus

EBNA1 is reported to contribute to tumor progression through an increase in reactive oxygen species via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of EBNA1-induced ROS accumulation in gastric cancer is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that miR34a regulation by EBNA1 determined cell fate in EBV-infected gastric cancer cells. ROS content and NOX2 expression were higher in EBNA1-expressing SNU719 cells than in EBNA1-nonexpressing SNU638 cells. Downregulation of NOX2 using siRNA technology in SNU719 cells decreased cell viability and ROS content. Regulation of EBNA1 expression in EBV-associated gastric cancers modulated NOX2 expression, ROS content and cell viability. We also showed that upregulation of NOX2 by EBNA1 was mediated by downregulating miRNA34a. Finally, overexpression of miR34a in EBNA1-expressing SNU719 cells induced typical apoptosis, suggesting that reactivation of miR34a in EBNA1-expressing gastric cancer cells could be a strategy for treatment of EBV-infected gastric cancer cells. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","EBNA1; EBV; miR34a; NOX2; ROS",Article,Scopus

Models to shift from haphazard, suboptimal and fragmented episodes of care to an integrated cancer care continuum must be developed, tested and implemented. Numerous studies demonstrate improved care when follow-up is assured by both oncology and primary care providers rather than either group alone. However, there is little data on the roles assumed by specialized oncology teams and primary care providers and the extent to which they work together. This study aims to develop, pilot test and measure outcomes of an innovative risk-based coordinated cancer care model for patients transitioning from specialized oncology teams to primary care providers. Methods/design: This multiple case study using a sequential mixed-methods design rests on a theory-driven realist evaluation approach to understand how transitions might be improved. The cases are two health regions in Quebec, Canada, defined by their geographic territory. Each case includes a Cancer Centre and three Family Medicine Groups selected based on differences in their determining characteristics. Qualitative data will be collected from document review (scientific journal, grey literature, local documentation), semi-directed interviews with key informants, and observation of care coordination practices. Qualitative data will be supplemented with a survey to measure the outcome of the coordinated model among providers (scope of practice, collaboration, relational coordination, leadership) and patients diagnosed with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer (access to care, patient-centredness, communication, self-care, survivorship profile, quality of life). Results from descriptive and regression analyses will be triangulated with thematic analysis of qualitative data. Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods data will be interpreted within and across cases in order to identify context-mechanism associations that explain outcomes. Discussion: The study will provide empirical data on a risk-based coordinated model of cancer care to guide actions at different levels in the health system. This in-depth multiple case study using a realist approach considers both the need for context-specific intervention research and the imperative to address research gaps regarding coordinated models of cancer care. © 2017 The Author(s).","Case study; Coordination; Intervention; Mixed methods; Primary care; Realist evaluation; Risk-based cancer care",Article,Scopus

Also, Smad3 is an essential intracellular mediator of TGF-β1-induced transcriptional responses during carcinogenesis. Therefore, it is highly advantageous to identify and develop inhibitors targeting Smad3 linker phosphorylation for the treatment of cancers. Galangin (3,5,7-trihydroxyflavone) has been known to be an active flavonoid showing a cytotoxic effect on several cancer cells. However, the mechanism of action of galangin in various cancers remains unclear, and there has been no report concerning regulation of Smad3 phosphorylation by galangin. In the present study, we show that galangin significantly induced apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation in the presence of TGF-β1 in both human prostate and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Particularly, galangin effectively inhibits phosphorylation of the Thr-179 site at Smad3 linker region through suppression of CDK4 phosphorylation.

However, recent reports reveal that plant extracts may function as inducers of autophagy of cancer cells. In general, autophagy confers survival advantage for cells responding to stress conditions, thus representing an important mechanism for chemo-resistance. This study was aimed to investigate the effectiveness of combined use of Salidroside (Sal, a phenylpropanoid glycosides from Rhodiola rosea L) with anti-tumor agents against colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, and moreover to evaluate the potential role of autophagy in the combined therapy. Methods: CRC cells, HCT-116, were incubated with Sal alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy agents including oxaliplatin (OXA), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and Doxorubicin (ADM). Cell proliferative characteristics were evaluated by cell viability and apoptosis rate. The protein expression was assessed by Immunofluorescent and Western blot assays. Results: Sal, alone or in combination with anti-tumor agents, increased expression of autophagic biomarkers, including LC3B and Becline-1, suggesting an autophagy induction. Except for the up-regulation of p-AMPK, p-mTOR, p-NF-ΚB (p65), TGF-β, p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 were down-regulated by Sal. Because autophagy is positively correlated with the activation of AMPK/mTOR, NF-ΚB, TGFβ1 and JAK2/STAT3 cascades, the autophagy induced by Sal may associate with AMPK activation. Indeed, blockage of AMPK signaling via Compound C or AMPK knockdown inhibited the autophagy. The blockage of AMPK signaling or a direct inhibition of autophagy via 3-MA increased effectiveness of combined use of Sal with anti-tumor agents against CRC. Conclusions: Inhibition of autophagy enhances synergistic effects of Sal and anti-tumor agents against colorectal cancer. This study provides experimental evidence and theoretical reference for improvement of a novel chemotherapy treatment protocol. © 2017 The Author(s).","AMPK signaling; Anti-tumor agents; Autophagy; Colorectal cancer; Salidroside",Article,Scopus

For patients with localised NSCLC (stages I to III), it has been speculated that immunotherapy may be helpful for reducing postoperative recurrence rates, or improving the clinical outcomes of current treatment for unresectable tumours. While several new agents have now entered phase III clinical trials, we felt a systematic review was needed to address the question of the effectiveness and safety of immunotherapy in patients with stages I to III NSCLC. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of immunotherapy (excluding checkpoint inhibitors) in patients with localised NSCLC (stages I to III) who received surgery or radiotherapy with curative intent. Search methods: We searched the following databases (from inception to 20 January 2017): CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL, and five trial registers. We also manually checked abstracts or reports from relevant conference proceedings and the reference lists of included trials. Selection criteria: We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults (≥ 18 years) with histologically-confirmed early-stage (stages I to III) NSCLC after surgical resection, and those with unresectable locally advanced stage III NSCLC who had received radiotherapy with curative intent. For patients who had received primary surgical treatment, postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy was allowed if it was used for both experimental and control groups. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected eligible trials, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We used survival analysis to pool time-to-event data, expressing the intervention effect as a hazard ratio (HR). We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data, and mean differences for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Due to clinical heterogeneity (immunotherapeutic agents with different underlying mechanisms), we used random-effects models for our meta-analyses. Main results: We identified nine eligible trials that randomised 4940 participants, who had received surgical resection or curative radiotherapy, to either an immunotherapy group or a control group. Included immunological interventions were active immunotherapy (i.e. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)), adoptive cell transfer (i.e. transfer factor (TF), tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), dendritic cell-cytokine induced killer (DC-CIK), and antigen-specific cancer vaccines (melanoma-associated antigen 3 (MAGE-A3) and L-BLP25). Except for one small trial, which provided insufficient information for risk assessment, we assessed five studies at high risk of bias for at least one of the seven biases studied; we considered the risk of bias in the other three trials to be low. We included data from seven of the nine trials in the meta-analyses (4695 participants). We pooled data from 3693 participants from the three high quality RCTs to evaluate overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). We found a small, but not statistically significant, improvement in OS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.06; P = 0.35), and PFS (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07; P = 0.19; high-quality evidence). The addition of immunotherapy resulted in a small, but not statistically significant, increased risk of having any adverse event (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.37; P = 0.11, three trials, 3955 evaluated participants, moderate-quality evidence), or severe adverse events (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.39; four trials, 4362 evaluated participants; low-quality evidence). We analysed data from six studies for one-, two-, and three-year survival rates (4265 participants), and from six studies for five-year survival rates (4234 participants). We observed no clear between-group differences (low-quality evidence for one- and two-year survival rates, and moderate-quality evidence for three- and five-year survival rate). No trial reported the overall response rates; only one trial provided health-related quality of life results. Authors' conclusions: The current literature does not provide evidence that suggests a survival benefit from adding immunotherapy (excluding checkpoint inhibitors) to conventional curative surgery or radiotherapy, for patients with localised NSCLC (stages I to III). The addition of vaccine-based immunotherapy might increase the risk of adverse events. Several ongoing trials with immune checkpoints inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1) might bring new insights for role of immunotherapy for patients with stages I to III NSCLC. © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Contrarily, there are recent evidence indicating that preoperative plasma fibrinogen, but not D-dimer might represent a prognostic factor in non-metastatic gastrointestinal cancers. Methods: In a single-center prospective study, we enrolled 62 patients undergoing surgery for pathologically confirmed PDAC without detectable venous thrombosis. Intraoperatively, the sample of the blood from the portal vein was obtained. DD concentration in these samples was measured. Patients were followed postoperatively until time of death from any cause. Results: We found that OS for patients with portal blood DD values above 2700 (ng/mL) (n=22 from 62 patients) was higher by 158% than that for the patients (n=42) with DD values ≤2700 (416days versus 161days, p=0.05). On the contrary to the studies investigating DD concentration in peripheral blood, we have found that patients with higher DD level in the portal vein had longer mean OS than patients with lower ones. Conclusions: Further investigation is necessary both to confirm our results in a larger patient population and to elucidate the mechanism for the correlation between portal blood D-dimer concentrations and survival time. Along with other authors, we conclude that portal circulation is characterized by unique, biological environment that requires further evaluation. © 2017 The Author(s).","D-dimers; Overall survival; Pancreatic cancer; Portal blood",Letter,Scopus

Nevertheless, the expression and prognostic values of DBC1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still not well understood. The following study investigated the clinical significance and biological function of DBC1 in HCC. Briefly, overexpression of DBC1 at transcriptional and translational levels in human HCC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues was observed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) approach. Furthermore, upregulated DBC1 was significantly correlated with tumor size (p = 0.005), N stage (p = 0.016), M stage (p = 0.011), tumor differentiation (p < 0.001), and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage (p = 0.001). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that DBC1 was an independent prognosis predictor for disease-free survival (DFS) (p < 0.001) and overall survival (OS) (p < 0.001). In addition, by using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assays and colony formation assays, we found that the knockdown of DBC1 significantly suppressed the proliferation of HCC cells in vitro.

Many types of cytochalasins have been identified and some of them have been reported to interfere with the formation of the autophagosome, although only limited data are available to assess their potential effects. Therefore, in this study, we examined the effects of cytochalasins and structurally related compounds on cell survival and the regulation of autophagy in human lung A549 adenocarcinoma cells. Cytochalasin D (CD) and cytochalasin E (CE) prominently inhibited the growth of A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Following treatment with CE, F-actin filaments were disrupted, and the proportion of binucleated cells increased, whereas no such effects were observed with the seven other cytochalasins tested. We found that cytochalasin H (CH), CD, and especially CE could induce the up-regulation of autophagy-related protein (LC3-II) and SQSTM1/p62. Using bafilomycin A1, we demonstrated that CD, CE, and CH inhibited autophagosome turnover, resulting in a dysfunctional autophagic process. The results of this study reveal that CE is the most potent cytochalasin in terms of its ability to induce cell death and inhibit autophagy.

To effectively treat HCC, new molecular targets and therapeutic approaches must be identified. 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/inosine monophosphate (IMP) cyclohydrolase (ATIC), a bifunctional protein enzyme, catalyzes the last two steps of the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway. Whether ATIC contributes to cancer development remains unclear. Methods: ATIC mRNA levels in different types of human HCC samples or normal tissues were determined from Gene Expression across Normal and Tumor tissue (GENT) database. The expression level of ATIC in human HCC samples or cell lines were examined by RT-PCR and western blot. Overall survival and disease-free survival of HCC patients in the ATIC low and ATIC high groups were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Effects of ATIC knockdown by lentivirus infection were evaluated on cell-proliferation, cell-apoptosis, colony formation and migration. The mechanisms involved in HCC cells growth, apoptosis and migration were analyzed by western blot and Compound C (C-C) rescue assays. Results: Here, we first demonstrated that expression of ATIC is aberrantly up-regulated in HCC tissues and high level of ATIC is correlated with poor survival in HCC patients. Knockdown of ATIC expression resulted in a dramatic decrease in proliferation, colony formation and migration of HCC cells. We also identified ATIC as a novel regulator of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream signaling mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). ATIC suppresses AMPK activation, thus activates mTOR-S6 K1-S6 signaling and supports growth and motility activity of HCC cells. Conclusion: Taken together, our results indicate that ATIC acts as an oncogenic gene that promotes survival, proliferation and migration by targeting AMPK-mTOR-S6 K1 signaling. © 2017 The Author(s).","AMPK; ATIC; Hepatocellular carcinoma",Article,Scopus

In colorectal cancer (CRC), EMT is associated with an invasive or metastatic phenotype. In this review, we discuss recent studies exploring novel regulation mechanisms of EMT in CRC, including the identification of new CRC EMT regulators. Upregulation of inducers can promote EMT, leading to increased invasiveness and metastasis in CRC. These inducers can downregulate E-cadherin and upregulate N-cadherin and vimentin (VIM) through modulating EMT-related signaling pathways, for instance WNT/β-catenin and TGF-β, and EMT transcription factors, such as zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) and ZEB2. In addition, several microRNAs (miRNAs), including members of the miR-34 and miR-200 families, are found to target mRNAs of EMT-transcription factors, for example ZEB1, ZEB2, or SNAIL. Downregulation of these miRNAs is associated with distant metastasis and advanced stage tumors. Furthermore, the role of EMT in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is also discussed. Mesenchymal markers on the surface of EMT CTCs were found to be associated with metastasis and could serve as potential biomarkers for metastasis. Altogether, these studies indicate that EMT is orchestrated by a complicated network, involving regulators of different signaling pathways. Further studies are required to understand the mechanisms underlying EMT in CRC. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Colorectal cancer; EMT; Metastasis",Review,Scopus

Several scoring models have been proposed to predict the outcome. However, none of these included immunohistochemical (IHC) markers as possible prognosticators. Methods: In this multicenter study, we collected clinical data and formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks of patients with histologically proven SFTP which had been surgically resected between 2000 und 2015. After systematic and extensive IHC staining on tissue microarrays, the results were analyzed and compared to histomorphological and clinical data for their possible prognostic value. Results: In total, 78 patients (mean age 61±11years) were included. Of these, 9 patients (11%) had an adverse outcome including SFTP recurrence (n=6) or SFTP-related death (n=3). Mean overall survival was 172±13months. 1 and 10-year event-free survival rates were 99% and 93%.

Conclusion: A high proliferation rate by MIB-1 IHC was associated with impaired outcome. Upon this, we established a new score using mitosis, necrosis, size of the tumor and MIB-1, which performed better than the traditional scores in our data set.

Hypoxia is a crucial factor influencing transcription process via protein modulation, which was shown i.e. in pancreatic cancer. Until now, hypoxia has been defined as associated with poorer outcome and inducing chemotherapy resistance in solid tumors. The unique phenomenon of pseudo-hypoxia connected with vhl mutation was observed in clear-cell, but not in papillary RCC, and the treatment of this subtype of cancer is still challenging. Despite the introduction of new antiangiogenic targeted therapies (inter alia tyrosine kinase inhibitors, TKIs), patients still develop both primary and acquired resistance. Overcoming resistance to TKIs, also in papillary RCC, may be possible by finding significantly modified protein expression. To do this, hypoxic 3D in vitro models must be developed to mimic both molecular pathways typical for low oxygen tension and cell-cell dynamics in tumor-like spatial structures. Results: Clear-cell and papillary renal cell carcinoma (cc and pRCC) cell lines were used in the study to determine the impact of hypoxia on primary drug resistance phenomenon previously observed in papillary, but not in ccRCC. Resistance was confirmed in monolayer culture and in 3D models in soft agar and suspension culture. Human papillary kidney cancer stem-like cells (HKCSCs) cultured in hypoxia developed resistance to sorafenib, while when cultured in normoxia resistance to axitinib has developed. Flow cytometry revealed that hypoxia decreased proliferation rates in all investigated RCC cells. In HKCSCs, there was an increase of quiescent cells (Ki67-) and percentage of cells arrested in S phase. It also appeared that map2k1 and eif4b protein expression is altered in papillary RCC resistant to tested drugs at different oxygen tensions. Also, HKCSCs did not express vegfr-1, braf nor c-kit, TKIs target receptors, which were present in ccRCC cells sensitive to TKI treatment. Conclusions: The results confirm that low oxygen tension affects RCC cells. Hypoxia facilitates induction of sorafenib resistance in pRCC and induces map2k1 overexpression, while normoxic axitinib-resistant cells up-regulated eif4b. Further studies may determine if map2k1 or eif4b proteins play a role in pRCC resistance to TKIs. It is also of interest to establish if other than vegfr-1, braf, c-kit receptors can serve as potential molecular targets for more effective anti-RCC strategies. © 2017 The Author(s).","3D cell culture; Clear-cell; Drug resistance; Hypoxia; Papillary; Renal cell carcinoma; Tyrosine kinase inhibitors",Article,Scopus

Immunohistochemical and statistical analysis showed that the expression of TRIP6 significantly correlated with HCC patients’ clinical stage and poor survival. Moreover, we demonstrated that overexpressing TRIP6 significantly enhanced, whereas silencing endogenous TRIP6 inhibited, the proliferation and the anchorage-independent growth ability of HCC cells. In addition, overexpression of TRIP6 accelerated, while inhibition of TRIP6 retarded, G1-S phase transition in HCC cells. We further found that overexpression of TRIP6 increased the activation of AKT and suppressed the transactivity of FOXO3a.

Methods: This is a prospective descriptive study of patients with CLM receiving preoperative chemotherapy before curative liver resection from November 2013 to June 2014. All patients had preoperative elastography and hepatic hemodynamic evaluation. We analyzed clinical preoperative data and postoperative outcomes after grouping the patients by chemotherapy type, development of sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS), and development of major complications. Results: Eleven from the 20 patients included in the study received preoperative oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (OBC). Nine patients had SOS at pathological analysis and five patients developed major complications. Patients receiving preoperative OBC had higher values of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and developed more SOS and major complications. Patients developing SOS had higher values of HVPG and developed more major complications. Patients with major complications had higher values of HVPG, and patients with a HVPG of 5mmHg or greater had more major complications than those under 5mmHg (20 vs 80%, p=0.005). Conclusions: OBC and SOS impair liver hemodynamics in CLM patients.

Our results demonstrated that all the urinary bladder SmCCs were associated with high grade UCas. They were more commonly seen in older male patients with a smoking history and had a poor prognosis. Based on the reported molecular subtyping, the UCas could be immunohistochemically subclassified into luminal, basal, dual and null types, which showed different clinicopathologic and IHC features. Compared to non-SmCC associated UCa, the subtypes of UCa in the combined SmCCs and UCas were characterized by: 1) Although overall luminal type was still relatively more common in men, basal marker-expressing subtypes were significantly increased in incidence and were more common in women. 2) Her2/Neu overexpression was more commonly observed in luminal than basal cell marker-expressing UCas. 3) IHC overexpression of p53 was common in all the subtypes, with UCas and SmCCs sharing the same p53 expression pattern. Although limited by relatively a small number of cases, the results of this study will enhance our understanding of the combined SmCC and UCa entity and potentially lead to a future therapeutic management. © 2017 Arányi Lajos Foundation","Immunohistochemistry; Molecular subtype; Small cell carcinoma of urinary bladder; Urothelial carcinoma",Article in Press,Scopus

Therapeutic options are limited in GBM and involve surgical resection followed by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Adjuvant therapies, including antiangiogenic treatments (AATs) targeting the VEGF–VEGFR pathway, have witnessed enhanced infiltration of bone marrow-derived myeloid cells, causing therapy resistance and tumor relapse in clinics and in preclinical models of GBM. This review article is focused on gathering previous clinical and preclinical reports featuring major challenges and lessons in GBM. Potential combination therapies targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME) to overcome the myeloid cell-mediated resistance problem in GBM are discussed. Future directions are focused on the use of TME-directed therapies in combination with standard therapy in clinical trials, and the exploration of novel therapies and GBM models for preclinical studies. We believe this review will guide the future of GBM research and therapy. © 2017 by the authors.

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) belongs to a family of lipid mediators. LPA and its naturally occurring analogues interact with G protein-coupled receptors on the cell surface and an intracellular nuclear hormone receptor. In addition, several enzymes that utilize LPA as a substrate or generate it as a product are under its regulatory control. Recent studies have demonstrated that the endogenously produced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) antagonist cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA), which is structurally similar to LPA, inhibits cancer cell invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. We recently observed that cPA negatively regulates PPARγ function by stabilizing the binding of the co-repressor protein, a silencing mediator of retinoic acid, and the thyroid hormone receptor. We also showed that cPA prevents neointima formation, adipocyte differentiation, lipid accumulation, and upregulation of PPARγ target gene transcription.

Ictus is a medical condition with a high prevalence in Spanish population. One of its most common consequences is aphasia. Nowadays, aphasia is treated with both neuropsychological and pharmacological therapy. However, in recent years, transcranial direct current stimulation has been presented as a complement to classical therapies. Aims. To familiarize the reader with transcranial direct current stimulation and to critically review the evidence on the benefits of this technique in aphasia rehabilitation. Development. The first part of this paper describes what transcranial electrical stimulation is. Subsequently, an analysis of the efficacy of this technique in the treatment of aphasia is presented. To achieve this, we searched in PubMed database and found 19 different scientific papers, published between 2008 and 2016, which used transcranial electrical stimulation in the treatment of aphasia. Conclusions. These studies suggest that, when it is used in conjunction with speech therapy, transcranial direct current electrical stimulation is effective in the treatment of aphasia. In addition, its benefits are observed when a minimum of five sessions with intensities higher than 1 mA, stimulating perilesional areas, and in those patients with fluent aphasias. However, the reviewed studies also suggest that this technique is not a substitutive of speech therapy, but a way to prime the brain to it. © 2017 Revista de Neurología.","Aphasia; Language; Neuropsychology; Rehabilitation; Stroke; TDCS; Transcranial direct current electrical stimulation",Review,Scopus

This study examines the impact of UVR exposure pattern on tumor development. Hairless C3.Cg/TifBomTac immunocompetent pigmented mice (n = 351) were irradiated with 12 standard erythema doses (SED)/week, given as 2 SED ×6, 3 SED ×4, 4 SED ×3, or 6 SED ×2 (dose–delivery study) or 0, 0.6, 1.2, 2, 3 or 4 SED ×3/week (dose–response study). All mice were irradiated until development of 3 tumors of 4 mm each. Pigmentation was measured once monthly. In the dose–delivery study, the median time until tumor development was independent of dose fractions. In the dose–response study, higher UVR doses resulted in faster tumor appearance. When the weekly UVR dose was decreased from 12 to 6 SED, the cumulative UVR dose needed for tumor development was reduced by 40%. In conclusion, delivery schedules of a fixed weekly UVR dose did not affect tumor development. When using different weekly UVR doses, longer time to tumor development was observed using lower UVR doses. Lower weekly UVR doses however resulted in lower cumulative UVR doses to induce tumors in hairless pigmented mice. © 2017 by the authors.

Studies had confirmed that HCC cell proliferation is associated with the cell cycle's G1 phase, but the detailed molecular mechanism has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A1 (eEF1A1) is an evolutionarily conserved elongation factor protein and is involved in tumor cell proliferation. However, which phase of the cell cycle is regulated by eEF1A1 to influence cell proliferation in HCC and its detailed molecular mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we observed that eEF1A1 influences HCC cell proliferation by regulating the cell cycle's G1 phase. In addition, eEF1A1 influences G1 phase by regulating cyclin D1 expression, promoting HCC cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, our results indicated that eEF1A1 regulates cyclin D1 expression through STAT1 signaling. STAT1 increases the transcriptional activity of cyclin D1 by binding to the cyclin D1 promoter. Taken together, these findings enabled us to identify a novel mechanism by which eEF1A1 regulates the cell cycle's G1 phase to promote tumor proliferation by regulating cyclin D1 expression through STAT1 signaling in HCC. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Cell cycle; Cyclin D1; eEF1A1; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Proliferation",Article,Scopus

However, few studies have investigated the effectiveness of 3D SonoAVC transvaginal ultrasound technology, particularly in infertile women. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the usefulness of three-dimensional (3D) SonoAVC transvaginal ultrasound technology for antral follicle count and its correlation to conventional two-dimensional (2D) transvaginal ultrasound and serum levels of anti-Müllerian hormone in infertile women. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 42 infertile women with age lower than 40years that underwent treatment at a private fertility clinic between June and December 2015. Patient data included age, body mass index and cause of infertility. On cycle day 3 the following hormone levels were measured: serum levels of anti-Müllerian hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, cancer antigen 125, prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone and oestradiol; the number of antral follicles was counted as well. The scanning were performed through 2D and 3D technology transvaginal ultrasound. Results: Using a Bland-Altman test we demonstrated that both technologies are quite equivalent. However, antral follicle count is higher using 3D ultrasound technology compared to 2D technology (p<0.001; Wilcoxon test), this finding is mainly remarkable in ovaries with more than 20 antral follicles. Moreover, the mean time required for manual 2D ultrasound and 3D SonoAVC measurements were 275±109 and 103±57s, respectively (p<0.001). Serum AMH concentration correlated to the total number of early antral follicles (correlation coefficients=0.678 and 0.612; p<0.001 by 2D ultrasound and 3D SonoAVC, respectively; Spearman's correlation test). Conclusions: Antral follicle count is better estimated using 3D ultrasound compared to 2D technology. A great advantage of 3D SonoAVC was less time required for an examination and the visual advantage when it need to count more than 20 follicles. Trial registration:CAAE: 35141114.4.0000.5327.

However, when caught early while the cancer is at a local stage, the 5-year survival rates rise to 83% and 79%, respectively. The oral carcinoma cancer is typically diagnosed by an oral health care provider by visual screening. However, many of these cancers are discovered when they have already progressed to a later stage. The goal of this research is to evaluate oral microbiome based biomarkers for early oral carcinoma detection. The outcome of this research is a machine-learning based framework for microbiome-based early cancer detection. The ability to identify at risk patients using minimally invasive biomarkers will allow for more rapid treatment plan development and improved outcome. The early diagnosis and treatment of cancer is essential for increasing patient survival odds and mitigating patient suffering. © 2017 IEEE.","biomarkers; cancer; feature extraction; machine learning; microbiome",Conference Paper,Scopus

We investigated the all-cause and cause-specific mortality dynamics in relation to baseline DM, statin use and metformin use. The study population consisted of 39,900 incident cancer cases from Finland, 19,822 patients were free of DM at the start of follow-up and 20,078 had DM. Mortality from all causes, and cancer, cardiovascular (CVD) and other causes was analysed using Poisson regression model with the following variables: sex, age, DM, statin and metformin usage in baseline, cancer type and stage and calendar period. Statin usage was associated with a reduced cancer-specific mortality with incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.69–0.74), IRR for CVD mortality was 0.95 (0.88–1.02) and for other causes 0.64 (0.56–0.74). In a sub-population of DM patients, IRR for metformin in all-cause mortality was 0.74 (0.71–0.78), in cancer mortality 0.75 (0.72–0.79), in CVD mortality 0.75 (0.68–0.83) and other causes 0.68 (0.60–0.78). In conclusion, our register-based study of survival after cancer diagnosis showed that patients with diabetes had substantially poorer outcome in all measures. An association between baseline statin usage and lower all-cause, cancer and cardiovascular mortality was modified by cancer type. The effect of statin use was largest for breast and colorectal cancer. Metformin usage in a subpopulation of oral antidiabetic users was in general associated with lower mortality, but this association was modified by cancer type. The association was strongest for liver, colorectal and breast cancer. © 2017 UICC","cancer survival; diabetes; metformin; statins",Article,Scopus

This may partly be attributable to subgroups of cancer patients who seek medical attention at late disease stages. It is unknown if differences in usual (i.e. customary) consultation frequency in general practice are associated with cancer prognosis. We aimed to estimate the cancer prognosis of cancer patients stratified by their usual consultation frequency in general practice. We performed a population-based cohort study including 123,943 incident cancer patients aged 50 to 89 years diagnosed in Denmark in 2009 to 2013. We estimated associations between the patient's usual general practitioner (GP) consultation frequency 19 to 36 months before the cancer diagnosis and all-cause mortality by using hazard ratios (HR), estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression. We also estimated the associations between the patient's usual GP consultation frequency and tumour stage, by using logistic regression estimates of odds ratios (ORs). Patients who usually did not see their GP (non-consulters) had higher all-cause mortality [HR = 1.39 (95% CI: 1.33–1.44)] compared to patients who usually saw their GP three to five times during an 18 months period (average consulters). Non-consulters had higher odds of having distant tumour stage [OR = 1.46 (95% CI: 1.38–1.57)] than average consulters. Similar, yet less strong, patterns were seen among patients with low usual GP consultation frequency, yet not statistically significant for all cancer types. In conclusion, the association between usual GP non-consultation and cancer prognosis is a combination of at least two things: a mechanism through more advanced tumour stage and other independent factors. © 2017 UICC","(early) diagnosis; Denmark; general practice; mortality; neoplasm; neoplasm staging; non-attendance; prognosis",Article,Scopus

The CONCORD program established worldwide surveillance of population-based cancer survival in 2015, analyzing individual data on 26 million patients (including 10 million US patients) diagnosed between 1995 and 2009 with 1 of 10 common malignancies. METHODS: In this Cancer supplement, we analyzed data from 37 state cancer registries that participated in the second cycle of the CONCORD program (CONCORD-2), covering approximately 80% of the US population. Data quality checks were performed in 3 consecutive phases: protocol adherence, exclusions, and editorial checks. One-, 3-, and 5-year age-standardized net survival was estimated using the Pohar Perme estimator and state- and race-specific life tables of all-cause mortality for each year. The cohort approach was adopted for patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2003, and the complete approach for patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2009. RESULTS: Articles in this supplement report population coverage, data quality indicators, and age-standardized 5-year net survival by state, race, and stage at diagnosis. Examples of tables, bar charts, and funnel plots are provided in this article. CONCLUSIONS: Population-based cancer survival is a key measure of the overall effectiveness of services in providing equitable health care. The high quality of US cancer registry data, 80% population coverage, and use of an unbiased net survival estimator ensure that the survival trends reported in this supplement are robustly comparable by race and state. The results can be used by policymakers to identify and address inequities in cancer survival in each state and for the United States nationally. Cancer 2017;123:4982-93. Published 2017.

The timing of pubertal growth—as measured by age at menarche and age at attained height—may also influence risk. We evaluated associations of adult height, age at attained height, and age at menarche with incidence of invasive breast cancer in 55,687 African American women in the prospective Black Women's Health Study. Over 20 years, 1,826 invasive breast cancers [1,015 estrogen receptor (ER) positive; 542 ER negative] accrued. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations with breast cancer overall and by ER status, mutually adjusted for the three factors of interest. Adult height was associated with increased risk of ER+ breast cancer (HR for ≥70 inches vs ≤63 inches: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.89) but not ER− (corresponding HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.71) (p heterogeneity = 0.34).

Results for age at menarche (≤11 vs ≥14 years) were similar for ER+ and ER− breast cancer (HR for breast cancer overall: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.50). We confirmed height as a strong risk factor for ER+ breast cancer in African American women and identified early age at attained height as a risk factor for both ER+ and ER− breast cancer, albeit without statistical significance of the latter associations. While adult height and timing of pubertal growth are inter-related, our findings suggest that they may be independent risk factors for breast cancer. © 2017 UICC","African American; breast cancer; epidemiology; height; pubertal growth; risk",Article,Scopus

The strong influence of hormones and reproductive factors on ovarian cancer suggests that endocrine disruptors may impact lifetime risk. Exposure to pesticides and other environmental agents may also increase the risk of ovarian cancer, but these studies are limited in number. Experimental models are of crucial importance to understand the biological and genetic factors that influence cancer development and to determine which environmental factors have an impact upon tumorigenic processes. Rodent models reflect very well the biology and histological appearance of a subset of human ovarian tumor types, notably the germ cell, sex cord-stromal and granulosa cell tumors; however, rodents do not spontaneously develop epithelial cancers that resemble human epithelial ovarian cancer, the most common type. Recent developments in genetically engineered models better reflect the potential for epithelial ovarian cancers to originate in the ovarian or fallopian tube (oviductal) epithelium. This article summarizes the wide range of spontaneous, experimentally derived, and genetically modified rodent models of ovarian tumors. Continuing improvements that enhance their clinical relevance will increase the value of these model systems for the assessment of environmental and toxicological agents that may impact ovarian cancer risk. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Epithelial ovarian cancer; Fallopian tube; Germ cell tumor; Granulosa cell; Mouse model; Ovarian cancer; Ovarian surface epithelium; Ovarian tumor; Oviductal epithelium; Sex cord-stromal tumor; Transgenic; Tumor histology",Book Chapter,Scopus

Monitoring breast cancer survival can help evaluate the effectiveness of health services, quantify inequities in outcomes between states or population subgroups, and inform efforts to improve the effectiveness of cancer management and treatment. METHODS: We analyzed breast cancer survival using individual patient records from 37 statewide registries that participated in the CONCORD-2 study, covering approximately 80% of the US population. Females were diagnosed between 2001 and 2009 and were followed through December 31, 2009. Age-standardized net survival at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years after diagnosis was estimated by state, race (white, black), stage at diagnosis, and calendar period (2001-2003 and 2004-2009). RESULTS: Overall, 5-year breast cancer net survival was very high (88.2%). Survival remained remarkably high from 2001 through 2009. Between 2001 and 2003, survival was 89.1% for white females and 76.9% for black females. Between 2004 and 2009, survival was 89.6% for white females and 78.4% for black females. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer survival was more than 10 percentage points lower for black females than for white females, and this difference persisted over time. Reducing racial disparities in survival remains a challenge that requires broad, coordinated efforts at the federal, state, and local levels. Monitoring trends in breast cancer survival can highlight populations in need of improved cancer management and treatment. Cancer 2017;123:5100-18. Published 2017.

The current study evaluates the activity and efficacy of the oral selective AR modulator RAD140 in in vivo and in vitro models of AR/ER+ breast cancer. Experimental Design: A series of in vitro assays were used to determine the affinity of RAD140 to 4 nuclear receptors and evaluate its tissue-selective AR activity. The efficacy and pharmacodynamics of RAD140 as monotherapy or in combination with palbociclib were evaluated in AR/ER+ breast cancer xenograft models. Results: RAD140 bound AR with high affinity and specificity and activatedARin breast cancer but not prostate cancer cells. Oral administration of RAD140 substantially inhibited the growth of AR/ER+ breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Activation of AR and suppression of ER pathway, including the ESR1 gene, were seen with RAD140 treatment. Coadministration of RAD140 and palbociclib showed improved efficacy in the AR/ER+ PDX models. In line with efficacy, a subset of AR-repressed genes associated with DNA replication was suppressed with RAD140 treatment, an effect apparently enhanced by concurrent administration of palbociclib. Conclusions: RAD140 is a potent AR agonist in breast cancer cells with a distinct mechanism of action, including the ARmediated repression of ESR1. It inhibits the growth of multiple AR/ER+ breast cancer PDX models as a single agent, and in combination with palbociclib.

This study reports ovarian cancer survival by state, race, and stage at diagnosis using data from the CONCORD-2 study, the largest and most geographically comprehensive, population-based survival study to date. METHODS: Data from women diagnosed with ovarian cancer between 2001 and 2009 from 37 states, covering 80% of the US population, were used in all analyses. Survival was estimated up to 5 years and was age standardized and adjusted for background mortality (net survival) using state-specific and race-specific life tables. RESULTS: Among the 172,849 ovarian cancers diagnosed between 2001 and 2009, more than one-half were diagnosed at distant stage. Five-year net survival was 39.6% between 2001 and 2003 and 41% between 2004 and 2009. Black women had consistently worse survival compared with white women (29.6% from 2001-2003 and 31.1% from 2004-2009), despite similar stage distributions. Stage-specific survival for all races combined between 2004 and 2009 was 86.4% for localized stage, 60.9% for regional stage, and 27.4% for distant stage. CONCLUSIONS: The current data demonstrate a large and persistent disparity in ovarian cancer survival among black women compared with white women in most states. Clinical and public health efforts that ensure all women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer receive appropriate, guidelines-based treatment may help to decrease these disparities. Future research that focuses on the development of new methods or modalities to detect ovarian cancer at early stages, when survival is relatively high, will likely improve overall US ovarian cancer survival.

Although incidence and death rates are now low, stomach cancer remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in black, Asian and Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native populations. METHODS: Data from the CONCORD-2 study were used to analyze stomach cancer survival among males and females aged 15 to 99 years who were diagnosed in 37 states covering 80% of the US population. Survival analyses were corrected for background mortality using state-specific and race-specific (white and black) life tables and age-standardized using the International Cancer Survival Standard weights. Net survival is presented up to 5 years after diagnosis by race (all, black, and white) for 2001 through 2003 and 2004 through 2009 to account for changes in collecting Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Summary Stage 2000 data from 2004. RESULTS: Almost one-third of stomach cancers were diagnosed at a distant stage among both whites and blacks. Age-standardized 5-year net survival increased between 2001 to 2003 and 2004 to 2009 (26.1% and 29%, respectively), and no differences were observed by race.

CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicate high fatality for stomach cancer, especially soon after diagnosis. Although improvements in stomach cancer survival were observed, survival remained relatively low for both blacks and whites. Primary prevention through the control of well-established risk factors would be expected to have the greatest impact on further reducing deaths from stomach cancer. Cancer 2017;123:4994-5013.

The objective of the current study was to evaluate recent changes in standardized thyroid cancer mortality using data from Statistics Korea. METHODS: Population and mortality data from 1985 through 2015 were obtained from Statistics Korea. Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) from thyroid cancer per 100,000 population were calculated based on the World Health Organization standard population. RESULTS: In Korea, the ASMRs from thyroid cancer increased from 0.17 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-0.18) per 100,000 in 1985 to 0.85 (95% CI, 0.83-0.86) per 100,000 in 2004, which was the highest among all countries. Subsequently, the ASMRs continuously decreased to 0.42 (95% CI, 0.41-0.43) per 100,000 between 2004 and 2015. The estimated annual percent change (APC) from 1985 to 2004 was 7.94 (95% CI, 6.43-9.46), and the corresponding value from 2004 to 2015 was −4.10 (95% CI, −5.76 to −2.40). Changes in the ASMRs reflected similar patterns in men (1985-2003: APC, 8.51; 2003-2015: APC, −4.32) and women (1985-2004: APC, 7.62; 2004-2015: APC, −4.38) and were also observed in older patients (aged ≥ 55 years). CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid cancer mortality in Korea increased until 2004 and then continuously decreased until 2015. Increases in the early diagnosis of thyroid cancer, changes in exposure to risk factors, and standardization in diagnosis and treatment may be associated with the decrease in thyroid cancer mortality in Korea.

We determined whether Glut1 silencing might enhance anti-proliferative effect of chemotherapeutic agents. Contrary to our hypothesis, ablation of Glut1 attenuated apoptosis and increased drug resistance via upregulation of p-Akt/p-GSK-3β (Ser9)/β-catenin/survivin.

Clustering based on comprehensive multi-omic molecular profiling can often achieve better results than those using a single data type, since each omic data type may contain complementary information. However, it is challenging to integrate heterogeneous omic data directly. Based on one popular method - Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), we presented Affinity Network Fusion (ANF), an 'upgrade' of SNF with several advantages. Similar to SNF, ANF treats each omic data type as one view of patients and learns a fused affinity matrix for clustering. We applied ANF to a harmonized TCGA dataset consisting of 2193 patients, and generated promising results on clustering patients into correct disease types. Our experimental results also demonstrated the power of feature selection and transformation combined with using ANF in patient clustering. Moreover, eigengap analysis suggests that the learned affinity matrices of four cancer types using our proposed framework may have successfully captured patient group structure and can be used for discovering unknown cancer subtypes. © 2017 IEEE.",,Conference Paper,Scopus

Methods: A 36-item survey was distributed to 3343 OHPs. Items included socio-demographic and work-related characteristics; self-assessed knowledge of oral cancer; perceived level of confidence in discussing oral health behaviors with patients; oral cancer screening practices; and self-evaluated need for additional training on screening procedures for oral cancer. Results: A total of 380 OHPs responded this survey, achieving an overall response rate of 9.4%. Forty-five were excluded from further analysis. Of these 335 OHP, 72% were dentists; (n=241); either GDP or Dental Specialists; 13.7% (n=46) were dental hygienists; 12.2% (n=41) were oral health therapists, and the remaining 2.1% (n=7) were dental therapists. While the majority (95.2%) agreed that oral cancer screening should be routinely performed, in actual practice around half (51.4%) screened all their patients. Another 12.8% ""Very rarely"" conducted screening examinations. The probability of routinely conducting an oral cancer screening was explored utilising Logistic Regression Analysis. Four variables remained statistically significant (p<0.0001). Results indicate that the likelihood of conducting an oral cancer screening rose with increasing levels of OHPs' confidence in oral cancer-related knowledge (OR=1.35; 95% CI: 1.09-1.67) and with higher levels of confidence in discussing oral hygiene practices with patients (OR=1.25; 95% CI: 1.03-1.52). Results also showed that dental specialists were less likely to perform oral cancer screening examinations compared with other OHPs (OR=0.18; 95% CI: 0.07-0.52) and the likelihood of performing an oral cancer screening decreased when the ""patient complained of a problem"" (OR=0.21; 95% CI: 0.10-0.44). Conclusion: Only half the study sample performed oral cancer screening examinations for all of their patients. This study provides evidence of the need for further oral cancer-related education and screening training for OHPs, which is vital to enhance oral cancer prevention and early detection. © 2017 The Author(s).","Australia; Oral cancer; Oral health professionals; Screening practices; Self-confidence",Article,Scopus

It accounts for 18.2% of all cancer deaths worldwide. Although somatic mutations play important roles in cancer development and prognosis, the outcome predictions are largely based on the expression of marker genes. We submit that developing an innovative prognostic model incorporating somatic mutations with gene expression can improve survival prediction of cancer. We studied the whole genome-wide gene expression and somatic mutations of 1091 breast invasive carcinoma cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We identified expression of 118 genes that could be used to build the predictor for breast cancer survival risks (log rank p < 0.0001 and c-index=0.63627122). Multiple breast cancer survival-Analysis-related genes are found in this gene set, such as FOXR2, FOXD1, MTNR1B, SDC1, PF4, IGF2BP1, ZIC3, OXT2, and PID1. We then selected between different survival-risk groups of 2000 mutated genes with different mutation rates. We applied enrichment analysis to the mutated gene list and identified 25 functional annotations, 15 gene ontology, and 14 gene pathway enriched terms that were related the cancer outcomes. We built the novel predictor and our results showed that combining the different features helps improved performance of survival prediction (c-index = 0. 64033769).

Clinicopathological factors alone are limited in detecting these patients, resulting in potential under/over-treatment. We sought to identify a prognostic tumor mutational profile that could predict CRC recurrence. Methods: Whole-exome sequencing data were obtained for 207 patients with stage II/III CRC from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Mutational landscape in relapse-free versus relapsed cohort was compared using Fisher's exact test, followed by multivariate Cox regression to identify genes associated with cancer recurrence. Bootstrap-validation was used to examine internal/external validity. Results: We identified five prognostic genes (APAF1, DIAPH2, NTNG1, USP7, and VAV2), which were combined to form a prognostic mutation panel. Patients with ≥1 mutation(s) within this five-gene panel had worse prognosis (3-yr relapse-free survival [RFS]: 53.0%), compared to patients with no mutation (3-yr RFS: 84.3%). In multivariate analysis, the five-gene panel remained prognostic for cancer recurrence independent of stage and high-risk features (hazard ratio 3.63, 95%CI [1.93-6.83], P < 0.0001). Furthermore, its prognostic accuracy was superior to the American Joint Commission on Cancer classification (concordance-index: 0.70 vs 0.54). Conclusions: Our proposed mutation panel identifies CRC patients at high-risk for recurrence, which may help guide adjuvant therapy and post-operative surveillance protocols. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adjuvant chemotherapy; colonic neoplasms; colorectal surgery; DNA mutational analysis; neoplasm recurrence; surgical oncology",Article,Scopus

The number of Americans who are diagnosed with and die of liver cancer has been rising slowly each year. Using data from the CONCORD-2 study, this study examined population-based survival by state, race, and stage at diagnosis. METHODS: Data from 37 statewide registries, which covered 81% of the US population, for patients diagnosed during 2001-2009 were analyzed. Survival up to 5 years was adjusted for background mortality (net survival) with state- and race-specific life tables, and it was age-standardized with the International Cancer Survival Standard weights. RESULTS: Liver cancer was diagnosed overall more often at the localized stage, with blacks being more often diagnosed at distant and regional stages than whites. 5-year net survival was 12.2% in 2001-2003 and 14.8% in 2004-2009. Whites had higher survival than blacks in both calendar periods (11.7% vs 9.1% and 14.3% vs 11.4%, respectively). During 2004-2009, 5-year survival was 25.7% for localized-stage disease, 9.5% for regional-stage disease, and 3.5% for distant-stage disease. CONCLUSIONS: Some progress has occurred in survival for patients with liver cancer, but 5-year survival remains low, even for those diagnosed at the localized stage. Efforts directed at controlling well-established risk factors such as hepatitis B may have the greatest impact on reducing the burden of liver cancer in the United States. Cancer 2017;123:5059-78.

Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, this study was designed to assess the association between health insurance status and childhood cancer survival. METHODS: Data on cancers diagnosed among children less than 15 years old from 2007 to 2009 were obtained from the SEER 18 registries. The effect of health insurance at diagnosis on 5-year childhood cancer mortality was estimated with marginal survival probabilities, restricted mean survival times, and Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression analyses, which were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and county-level poverty. RESULTS: Among 8219 childhood cancer cases, the mean survival time was 1.32 months shorter (95% confidence interval [CI], −4.31 to 1.66) after 5 years for uninsured children (n = 131) versus those with private insurance (n = 4297), whereas the mean survival time was 0.62 months shorter (95% CI, −1.46 to 0.22) for children with Medicaid at diagnosis (n = 2838). In Cox PH models, children who were uninsured had a 1.26-fold higher risk of cancer death (95% CI, 0.84-1.90) than those who were privately insured at diagnosis. The risk for those with Medicaid was similar to the risk for those with private insurance at diagnosis (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.93-1.21). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results suggest that cancer survival is largely similar for children with Medicaid and those with private insurance at diagnosis. Slightly inferior survival was observed for those who were uninsured in comparison with those with private insurance at diagnosis. The latter result is based on a small number of uninsured children and should be interpreted cautiously. Further study is needed to confirm and clarify the reasons for these patterns.

However, the basis for its overexpression and its growth-inhibitory effects are mitigated and uncertain. Here, we report that PACE4 pre-mRNA undergoes DNA methylation–sensitive alternative splicing of its terminal exon 30 untranslated region, generating an oncogenic, C-terminally modified isoform (PACE4-altCT). We found this isoform to be strongly expressed in prostate cancer cells, where it displayed an enhanced autoactivating process and a distinct intracellular routing that prevented its extracellular secretion. Together, these events led to a dramatic increase in processing of the progrowth differentiation factor pro-GDF15 as the first PACE4 substrate to be identified in prostate cancer. We detected robust expression of PACE4-altCT in other cancer types, suggesting that an oncogenic switch for this proenzyme may offer a therapeutic target not only in advanced prostate cancer but perhaps also more broadly in human cancer. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",,Article,Scopus

The fusion gene is formed by chromosomal mutations and is an important factor in causing cancer. Studies have shown that only a small number of identified fusion genes play a role in the carcinogenesis process. Identifying those genes is important for the study and treatment of cancer. There are only few methods for measuring importance of cancer fusion genes due to the research level remaining in start stage. It is known that the importance of fusion gene can be obtained through the gene network. In this paper, the importance of cancer fusion gene based on synchronization stability theory is proposed. The algorithm evaluates the importance of nodes in the gene network based on the theory of 'destructive equal importance', and evaluates the importance of the corresponding fusion genes through the importance of gene nodes. In the process of assessing the importance of nodes, the theory of synchronization stability is introduced to relatively stabilize the gene network. The degree of damage of the nodes is calculated by using the network difference calculation method, which indicates the importance of the gene nodes. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a good evaluation effect on cancer fusion gene measurement. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the importance of cancer fusion genes, and proposes a fusion gene importance evaluation algorithm, which is helpful for the identification of important fusion genes in cancer pathogenesis. © 2017 IEEE.","Cancer genomics; cancer susceptibility gene; gene fusion; gene prioritzing; network synchronization algorithm",Conference Paper,Scopus

This analysis sought to determine whether adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with increased survival in NSCLC patients with residual N1 disease at resection. Methods: Patients from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) with cN1T1-2M0 NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and definitive resection between 2006 and 2012 were identified. Treatment groups were defined as those receiving no additional therapy or adjuvant chemotherapy ± radiation after resection. Five-year overall survival (OS) was estimated for each group. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate hazard ratios adjusting for demographic, clinical, and facility characteristics. Results: Among 90 eligible patients, 5-year OS was 43% and 56% for patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and no additional treatment, respectively (P < 0.56). With multivariable analysis, the estimated hazard ratio was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.61-2.64, P = 0.51) for adjuvant chemotherapy compared to no additional therapy. Conclusion: This analysis suggests that adjuvant chemotherapy is not associated with increased survival in NSCLC patients with pathologic N1 NSCLC following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and resection. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","national cancer database (NCDB); neoadjuvant chemotherap; non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)",Article,Scopus

Here, we show that in advanced ovarian cancers NFkB signaling via the RelB transcription factor supports TIC populations by directly regulating the cancer stem-like associated enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Loss of RelB significantly inhibited spheroid formation, ALDH expression and activity, chemoresistance, and tumorigenesis in subcutaneous and intrabursal mouse xenograft models of human ovarian cancer. RelB also affected expression of the ALDH gene ALDH1A2. Interestingly, classical NFkB signaling through the RelA transcription factor was equally important for tumorigenesis in the intrabursal model, but had no effect on ALDH. In this case, classical signaling via RelA was essential for proliferating cells, whereas the alternative signaling pathway was not. Our results show how NFkB sustains diverse cancer phenotypes via distinct classical and alternative signaling pathways, with implications for improved understanding of disease recurrence and therapeutic response. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",,Article,Scopus

Methods: Using Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium registry data from 2010 through 2014, we identified women with an incident non-metastatic breast cancer and determined use of preoperative MRI and initial surgical treatment (mastectomy, with or without contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM), reconstruction, and breast conserving surgery ± radiation). Clinical and sociodemographic covariates were included in multivariable logistic regression models to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results: Of the 13 097 women, 2217 (16.9%) had a preoperative MRI. Among the women with MRI, results indicated 32% higher odds of unilateral mastectomy compared to breast conserving surgery and of mastectomy with CPM compared to unilateral mastectomy.

Because there are different miRNAs implicated in all the stages of cancer, for example, functioning as oncogenes, this makes these small molecules suitable targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy. RNA-mediated interference has been one major approach for sequence-specific regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic organisms. Recently, the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 system, first identified in bacteria and archaea as an adaptive immune response to invading genetic material, has been explored as a sequence-specific molecular tool for editing genomic sequences for basic research in life sciences and for therapeutic purposes. There is growing evidence that small noncoding RNAs, including miRNAs, can be targeted by the CRISPR/Cas9 system despite their lacking an open reading frame to evaluate functional loss. Thus, CRISPR/Cas9 technology represents a novel gene-editing strategy with compelling robustness, specificity, and stability for the modification of miRNA expression. Here, I summarize key features of current knowledge of genomic editing by CRISPR/Cas9 technology as a feasible strategy for globally interrogating miRNA gene function and miRNA-based therapeutic intervention.

Methods: A total of 25,038 Black and White adults were included in the analysis. Metabolic dysregulation was defined in two ways: 1) using the joint harmonized criteria for metabolic syndrome (MetS) and 2) based on factor analysis of 15 variables characterizing metabolic dysregulation. We estimated hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of MetS and metabolic dysregulation with cancer mortality during follow-up using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: About 46% of Black and 39% of White participants met the criteria for MetS. Overall, participants with MetS (HR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.03-1.45) were at increased risk of cancer-related death. In race-stratified analysis, Black participants with MetS had significantly increased risk of cancer mortality compared with those without MetS (HR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.01-1.72), increasing to more than a 2-fold risk of cancer mortality among those with five metabolic syndrome components (HR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.01-5.51). Conclusions: There are marked racial differences in the prevalence of metabolic dysregulation defined as MetS based on the harmonized criteria. The strong positive associations between MetS and cancer mortality suggests that efforts to improve cancer outcomes in general, and racial disparities in cancer outcomes specifically, may benefit from prevention and management of MetS and its components. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cancer; Cancer mortality; Metabolic syndrome; Racial disparities; Survival",Article,Scopus

Clinical presentation, electrocardiogram, laboratory data, and transthoracic echocardiogram results registered during the acute phase and follow-up were collected. All patients underwent coronary angiography. The most frequent presenting symptoms were chest pain in 63.3% of the patients and shortness of breath/dyspnea on exertion in 27% of the patients. T-wave inversion was a more common electrocardiographic presentation (60%) than ST elevation (13.3%). The median and interquartile range of peak creatine kinase MB fraction, troponin I, and brain natriuretic peptide were creatine kinase MB fraction 8.9, 4.6 to 21.1; troponin I 1.31, 0.7 to 3.3; and brain natriuretic peptide 1,124, 453.5 to 2,369.5.

Median time to resume cancer treatment was 20 days after SC. None of the patients experienced recurrence of SC and other cardiac events. In conclusion, SC should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cancer patients who present with chest pain and ECG findings characteristic of acute coronary syndrome.

Filipinos in the United States are known to have high rates of thyroid cancer incidence and disease recurrence. To the authors' knowledge, it is unknown whether Filipinos also have higher thyroid cancer mortality rates. METHODS: The authors studied thyroid cancer mortality in Filipino, non-Filipino Asian (NFA), and non-Hispanic white (NHW) adults using US death records (2003-2012) and US Census data. Age-adjusted mortality rates and proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) were calculated. Sex, nativity status, age at death, and educational attainment also were examined. RESULTS: The authors examined 19,940,952 deaths. The age-adjusted mortality rates due to thyroid cancer were highest in Filipinos (1.72 deaths per 100,000 population; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.51-1.95) compared with NFAs (1.03 per 100,000 population; 95% CI, 0.95-1.12) and NHWs (1.17 per 100,000 population; 95% CI, 1.16-1.18). Compared with NHWs, higher proportionate mortality was observed in Filipino women (3-5 times higher) across all age groups, and among Filipino men, the PMR was 2 to 3 times higher in the subgroup aged >55 years. Filipinos who completed a higher educational level had a notably higher PMR (5.0) compared with their counterparts who had not (3.5). CONCLUSIONS: Negative prognostic factors for thyroid cancer traditionally include age >45 years and male sex. The results of the current study demonstrate that Filipinos die of thyroid cancer at higher rates than NFA and NHW individuals of similar ages. Highly educated Filipinos and Filipino women may be especially at risk of poor thyroid cancer outcomes. Filipino ethnicity should be factored into clinical decision making in the management of patients with thyroid cancer.

In this study, the known GC signaling contexts including cancer hallmarks (DNA repair, WNT signaling, Notch signaling) were inspected in terms of mutational co-occurrences, in particular, for a specific GC phenotype, microsatellite instability (MSI) statuses. By using correlations for measuring mutational co-occurrences of gene pairs belonging to the cancer hallmarks, we constructed mutational co-occurring networks for each MSI status.

""Ovarian stem cells"" expressing germline pluripotent markers serve as novel paradigm with potential to address infertility, menopause, and probably influence tumor initiation. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) pose vital role in tumor recurrence and hence it is extremely important to study them with respect to ovarian stem cells across various cancer stages and normal ovaries. Pluripotent (OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, SSEA1, and SSEA4), germline (IFITM3, VASA/DDX4), and cancer stem (CD44, LGR5) cell specific markers were characterized for protein and mRNA expression in tumor tissues to understand their distribution in the surface epithelium and ovarian cortex in benign, borderline, and high-grade malignant stages. To elucidate whether pluripotent ovarian germline stem cells and CSCs are common subset of stem cells in tumor tissues, VASA was colocalized with known pluripotent stem (OCT4, SSEA1, SSEA4) and CSC (CD44, LGR5) specific markers by confocal microscopy. Single, smaller spherical (≤5 μm), and larger elliptical fibroblast like (≥10 μm) cells (also in clusters or multiples) were detected implying probable functional behavioral significance of cells in tumor initiation and metastasis across various cancer stages. Cells revealed characteristic staining pattern in ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) and cortex regions exclusive for each marker. Co-expression studies revealed specific subpopulations existing simultaneously in OSE and cortex and that a dynamic hierarchy of (cancer) stem cells with germline properties prevails in normal ovaries and cancer stages. Novel insights into CSC biology with respect to ovarian and germline stem cell perspective were obtained. Understanding molecular signatures and distribution within ovarian tissue may enable identification of precise tumor-initiating CSC populations and signaling pathways thus improving their efficient targeting and strategies to prevent their dissemination causing fatal relapse. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Cancer stem cells; DDX4/VASA; germline stem cells; ovarian cancer; ovarian stem cells; ovarian surface epithelium",Article,Scopus

METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base was reviewed for the period of 2006-2014, and patients with HNSCC undergoing surgery and PORT were identified. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, Cox regression analysis, and propensity score matching were used to determine the effects of initiating PORT within 6 weeks of surgery and different time-to-PORT intervals on survival. RESULTS: This study included 41,291 patients. After adjustments for covariates, starting PORT >6 weeks postoperatively was associated with decreased OS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.13; 99% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.19). This finding remained in the propensity score–matched subset (hazard ratio, 1.21; 99% CI, 1.15-1.28). In comparison with starting PORT 5 to 6 weeks postoperatively, initiating PORT earlier was not associated with improved survival (aHR for ≤ 4 weeks, 0.93; 99% CI, 0.85-1.02; aHR for 4-5 weeks, 0.92; 99% CI, 0.84-1.01). Increasing durations of delay beyond 7 weeks were associated with small, progressive survival decrements (aHR, 1.09, 1.10, and 1.12 for 7-8, 8-10, and >10 weeks, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Nonadherence to NCCN guidelines for initiating PORT within 6 weeks of surgery was associated with decreased survival. There was no survival benefit to initiating PORT earlier within the recommended 6-week timeframe. Increasing durations of delay beyond 7 weeks were associated with small, progressive survival decrements.

METHODS: Data from CONCORD-2 were used to analyze net survival among patients with lung cancer (aged 15-99 years) who were diagnosed in 37 states covering 80% of the US population. Survival was corrected for background mortality using state-specific and race-specific life tables and age-standardized using International Cancer Survival Standard weights. Net survival was estimated for patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2003 and between 2004 and 2009 at 1, 3, and 5 years after diagnosis by race (all races, black, and white); Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Summary Stage 2000; and US state. RESULTS: Five-year net survival increased from 16.4% (95% confidence interval, 16.3%-16.5%) for patients diagnosed 2001-2003 to 19.0% (18.8%-19.1%) for those diagnosed 2004-2009, with increases in most states and among both blacks and whites. Between 2004 and 2009, 5-year survival was lower among blacks (14.9%) than among whites (19.4%) and ranged by state from 14.5% to 25.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer survival improved slightly between the periods 2001-2003 and 2004-2009 but was still low, with variation between states, and persistently lower survival among blacks than whites. Efforts to control well established risk factors would be expected to have the greatest impact on reducing the burden of lung cancer, and efforts to ensure that all patients receive timely and appropriate treatment should reduce the differences in survival by race and state.

We assessed the effect of pCR and nCRT schedule in EC. Methods: Patients with T1N+/T2-4aN0-3/M0 EC treated in different centers, with either carboplatin/paclitaxel/41.4 Gy (CROSS: n = 134) or Cisplatin/5-fluorouracil/45-50.4 Gy (Cis/5FU: n = 88) followed by surgery were included. The effect of pCR on distribution and site-specific recurrence was determined for the CROSS group. After propensity score matching we compared the impact of both schedules (n = 63 each) on the recurrence pattern. Results: Overall (P = 0.005) and disease-free survival (P = 0.002) were significantly longer after pCR (n = 24). The pattern of recurrence differed between pCR and non-pCR group (P = 0.001) for locoregional (0 vs 7; 6.4%), distant (5; 20.8% vs 36; 32.7%), and combined local and distant (0 vs 21; 19.1%), respectively. After pCR, less local and distant recurrences were seen (P = 0.008). With equal median time to recurrence, the distribution of metastases only differed for lung metastases (P = 0.029), with 15 (23.8%) in the CROSS group versus 6 (9.5%) following Cis/5FU. Conclusions: Patients with pCR have less local and distant recurrence.

Tobacco products are estimated to cause approximately 90% of lung cancer cases. Experimental studies in laboratory animals have collectively demonstrated the carcinogenicity of cigarette smoke and cigarette smoke condensates. There are over 5000 identified chemicals and more than 60 known carcinogens in cigarette smoke, with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and the tobacco-specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone likely being the most important respiratory carcinogens. The carcinogenicity of cigarette smoke can also be enhanced by the presence of tumor promoters and cocarcinogens. The reaction of carcinogens with DNA can cause mutations and, if unrepaired, can lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor suppressors. Epigenetic changes may also occur from exposure to tobacco carcinogens, leading to a change in gene expression. While the majority of lung cancer results from cigarette smoking, only 15% of smokers get lung cancer. Studies indicate that this may be due to genetic factors that contribute to a person's susceptibility to tobacco-induced cancers. Biomarkers have been developed to monitor uptake and activation of tobacco carcinogens, and perhaps could be used to predict susceptibility to lung cancer. Chemoprevention has developed as an approach to prevent or delay the onset of tobacco-induced lung cancer. However, cessation of tobacco products is the best way to prevent lung cancer. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","1,3-Butadiene; 3-Methylindole; Acrolein; Aldehydes; Benzo[a]pyrene; Biomarker; Carcinogen; Carcinogenesis; Chemoprevention; Chromium; Cigarette smoke; DNA adduct; Environmental tobacco smoke; Lung cancer; NNK; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Respiratory carcinogen; Secondhand smoke; Tobacco; Tobacco-specific nitrosamines; Urinary metabolite; α-Hydroxylation",Book Chapter,Scopus

Prior research has suggested that cancer survival is influenced by multiple factors from multiple levels. Most of existing analyses of cancer survival used data from a single source. Nevertheless, there are key challenges in integrating variables from different sources. Data integration is a daunting task because data from different sources can be heterogeneous in syntax, schema, and particularly semantics. Thus, we propose to adopt a semantic data integration approach that generates a universal conceptual representation of ""information"" including data and their relationships.

The CONCORD-2 study (2015) enabled the examination of survival trends between 1995 and 2009 for US states by race and stage. METHODS: The authors analyzed data from 37 state population-based cancer registries, covering approximately 80% of the US population, for patients who were diagnosed with colon cancer between 2001 and 2009 and were followed through 2009. Survival up to 5 years was corrected for background mortality (net survival) using state-specific and race-specific life tables and age-standardized using the International Cancer Survival Standard weights. Survival is presented by race (all, black, white), stage, state, and calendar period (2001-2003 and 2004-2009) to account for changes in methods used to collect stage. RESULTS: Five-year net survival increased by 0.9%, from 63.7% between 2001 and 2003 to 64.6% between 2004 and 2009. More black than white patients were diagnosed with distant-stage disease between 2001 and 2003 (21.5% vs 17.2%) and between 2004 and 2009 (23.3% vs 18.8%).

The absolute difference between blacks and whites decreased by only 1% during the decade. CONCLUSIONS: Five-year net survival from colon cancer increased slightly over time. Survival among blacks diagnosed between 2004 and 2009 had still not reached the level of that among whites diagnosed between 1990 and 1994, some 15 to 20 years earlier. These findings suggest a need for more targeted efforts to improve screening and to ensure timely, appropriate treatment, especially for blacks, to reduce this large and persistent disparity in survival.

The current study examined whether the observed mortality reduction was due primarily to the prevention of incident CRC via removal of adenomatous polyps or to the early detection of cancer and improved survival. METHODS: The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial randomized 154,900 men and women aged 55 to 74 years. Individuals underwent FS screening at baseline and at 3 or 5 years versus usual care. CRC-specific survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and proportional hazards modeling. The authors estimated the percentage of CRC deaths averted by early detection versus primary prevention using a model that applied intervention arm survival rates to CRC cases in the usual-care arm and vice versa. RESULTS: A total of 1008 cases of CRC in the intervention arm and 1291 cases of CRC in the usual-care arm were observed. Through 13 years of follow-up, there was no significant difference noted between the trial arms with regard to CRC-specific survival for all CRC (68% in the intervention arm vs 65% in the usual-care arm; P =.16) or proximal CRC (68% vs 62%, respectively; P =.11) cases; however, survival in distal CRC cases was found to be higher in the intervention arm compared with the usual-care arm (77% vs 66%; P<.0001). Within each arm, symptom-detected cases had significantly worse survival compared with screen-detected cases. Overall, approximately 29% to 35% of averted CRC deaths were estimated to be due to early detection and 65% to 71% were estimated to be due to primary prevention. CONCLUSIONS: CRC-specific survival was similar across arms in the PLCO trial, suggesting a limited role for early detection in preventing CRC deaths. Modeling suggested that approximately two-thirds of avoided deaths were due to primary prevention. Future CRC screening guidelines should emphasize primary prevention via the identification and removal of precursor lesions.

Epigenetic changes including DNA methylation, histone modifications and ncRNAs/miRNAs are associated with regulation of DNA chromatin and specifically, gene transcription. Hence, these produce eminent effects upon proto-oncogenes, tumor-suppressors and key cancer-regulatory signaling pathways. Understanding of epigenomic regulation of HER2 overexpression and signaling may help uncover the unmatchable physiology of HER2 gene/protein. Moreover, this may also aid in resolving the major issue of resistance-development towards HER2 targeted agents (trastuzumab and lapatinib), since epigenetic alterations are important therapeutic markers and modulate the response towards HER2 targeted therapy. Therefore, in this review the information regarding various epigenetic markers implicated in HER2 positive breast cancer susceptibility and therapeutic-strategies has been compiled. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS","DNA methylation; HER2 positive breast cancer; Histone modifications; miRNA; ncRNA; Susceptibility; Therapy",Review,Scopus

In this study, we used computational methods and The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset analysis to identify novel miRNAs that target CDK4/6 and exhibit potential for therapeutic development in colorectal cancer. The 30UTR of CDK4/6 mRNAs are targeted by a family of miRNAs, which includes miR-6883-5p, miR-149, miR-6785-5p, and miR-4728-5p. Ectopic expression of miR-6883-5p or miR-149 downregulated CDK4 and CDK6 levels in human colorectal cancer cells. RNA-seq analysis revealed an inverse relationship between the expression of CDK4/6 and miR-149 and intronic miRNA-6883-5p encoding the clock gene PER1 in colorectal cancer patient samples. Restoring expression of miR-6883-5p and miR-149 blocked cell growth leading to G0–G1 phase cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. CDK4/6 targeting by miR-6883-5p and miR-149 could only partially explain the observed antiproliferative effects. Notably, both miRNAs synergized with the frontline colorectal cancer chemotherapy drug irinotecan. Further, they resensitized mutant p53-expressing cell lines resistant to 5-fluorouracil.

Objective of the current study was to describe cervical cancer survival trends among US women and examine differences by race and stage. METHODS: This study used data from the CONCORD-2 study to compare survival among women (aged 15-99 years) diagnosed in 37 states covering 80% of the US population. Survival was adjusted for background mortality (net survival) with state- and race-specific life tables and was age-standardized with the International Cancer Survival Standard weights. Five-year survival was compared by race (all races, blacks, and whites). Two time periods, 2001-2003 and 2004-2009, were considered because of changes in how the staging variable was collected. RESULTS: From 2001 to 2009, 90,620 women were diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer. The proportion of cancers diagnosed at a regional or distant stage increased over time in most states. Overall, the 5-year survival was 63.5% in 2001-2003 and 62.8% in 2004-2009. The survival was lower for black women versus white women in both calendar periods and in most states; black women had a higher proportion of distant-stage cancers. CONCLUSIONS: The stability of the overall survival over time and the persistent differences in survival between white and black women in all US states suggest that there is a need for targeted interventions and improved access to screening, timely treatment, and follow-up care, especially among black women.

The sequences were analyzed for viruses based on two bioinformatics algorithms (paracel-blast (sensitive for detection of known viruses) and hidden Markov model (HMM; sensitive for distantly related viruses)). Among the 62 NMSCs, the virus family detected in the largest proportion of specimens was Mimiviridae (9/62 NMSCs). The majority of the virus-related reads belonged to Papillomaviridae.

We included broad exposure occurred in a range of wood-processing occupation across varied industries in four Nordic countries. A population-based case-control study was conducted on all male cases with nasal adenocarcinoma (393 cases), other types of nasal cancer (2,446) and nasopharyngeal cancer (1,747) diagnosed in Finland, Sweden, Norway and Iceland between 1961 and 2005. For each case, five male controls, who were alive at the time of diagnosis of the case (index date), were randomly selected, matched by birth-year and country. Cumulative exposures (CE)s to wood dust and formaldehyde before the index date were quantified based on a job-exposure matrix linked to occupational titles derived from population censuses. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the CE of wood dust were estimated by conditional logistic regression, adjusted for CE to formaldehyde and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. There was an increasing risk of nasal adenocarcinoma related to wood dust exposure. The HR in the highest CE category of wood dust (≥ 28.82 mg/m3-years) was 16.5 (95% CI 5.05–54.1). Neither nonadenocarcinoma of the nose nor nasopharyngeal cancer could be linked to wood dust exposure.

Many supervised learning methods have been applied to classification of cancer subtypes in the past few years, especially of deep learning based methods. Recently, a deep forest model has been proposed as an alternative of deep neural networks to learn hyper-representations by using cascade ensemble decision trees, and it has been proved that deep forest model has competitive or even better performance than deep neural networks. However, the original deep forest may face under-fitting and ensemble diversity problems when dealing with small sample size, and high-dimension biology data. It is important to improve the deep forest model to work better on small-scale biology data. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model to follow the mission of cancer subtype classification on small-scale biology data sets, which can be viewed as modification of original deep forest model. Our model distinguishes from the original deep forest model with two main contributions: First, a named multi-class-scanning method is proposed to train multiple simple binary classifiers to encourage diversity of ensemble. Meanwhile, the fitting quality of each classifier is considered in representations learning. Second, we propose a boosting strategy to emphasize more important features in cascade forests of representations learning, thus to propagate the benefits of discriminative features among layers to improve the overall classification performance. Systematical experiments on both microarray and RNA-seq data sets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the most state-of-the-art classification methods in application of cancer subtype classifications. © 2017 IEEE.","cancer subtype; classification; deep forsest; deep learning",Conference Paper,Scopus

Here, we examined the effects of age at first and last births and age at use of COCs using data from studies conducted in Los Angeles County, California, USA (1,632 cases, 2,340 controls). After adjusting for the number of births, every 5 years that a first birth was delayed reduced the risk of ovarian cancer by 13% (95% CI 5–21%; p = 0.003); a first birth after age 35 was associated with a 47% lower risk than a first birth before age 25. COC use before age 35 was associated with greater protection per year of use than COC use at older ages. Considering previously published results as well as the results presented here, increasing parity and a later age at births are both important protective factors against ovarian cancer and the protection extends over 30 or more years from last birth.

We estimated the cumulative lifetime risk (CLR) of cervical cancer and excisional treatment, and change in adverse obstetric outcomes in HPV unvaccinated women and cohorts offered vaccination (>70% coverage in 12–13 years) for the Australian cervical screening program. Two-yearly cytology screening (ages 18–69 years) was compared to 5-yearly primary HPV screening with partial genotyping for HPV16/18 (ages 25–74 years). A dynamic model of HPV transmission, vaccination, cervical screening and treatment for precancerous lesions was coupled with an individual-based simulation of obstetric complications. For cytology screening, the CLR of cervical cancer diagnosis, death and treatment was estimated to be 0.649%, 0.198% and 13.4% without vaccination and 0.182%, 0.056% and 6.8%, in vaccinated women, respectively. For HPV screening, relative reductions of 33% and 22% in cancer risk for unvaccinated and vaccinated women are predicted, respectively, compared to cytology. Without the implementation of vaccination, a 4% increase in treatment risk for HPV versus cytology screening would have been expected, implying a possible increase in pre-term delivery (PTD) and low birth weight (LBW) events of 19 to 35 and 14 to 37, respectively, per 100,000 unvaccinated women. However, in vaccinated women, treatment risk will decrease by 13%, potentially leading to 4 to 41 fewer PTD events and from 2 more to 52 fewer LBW events per 100,000 vaccinated women. In unvaccinated women in cohorts offered vaccination as 12–13 year olds, no change to lifetime treatment risk is expected with HPV screening. In unvaccinated women in cohorts offered vaccination as 12–13 year olds, no change to lifetime treatment risk is expected with HPV screening. HPV screening starting at age 25 in populations with high vaccination coverage, is therefore expected to both improve the benefits (further decrease risk of cervical cancer) and reduce the harms (reduce treatments and possible obstetric complications) associated with cervical cancer screening. © 2017 UICC","cervical screening; excisional treatment; HPV testing; low birth weight; obstetric outcomes; pre-term delivery",Article,Scopus

We hypothesized that higher tumor CASR expression might be associated with improved survival among colorectal cancer patients. We evaluated tumor expression levels of CASR by immunohistochemistry in 809 incident colorectal cancer patients within the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate multivariable hazard ratio (HR) for the association of tumor CASR expression with colorectal cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. We adjusted for potential confounders including tumor biomarkers such as microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, LINE-1 methylation level, expressions of PTGS2, VDR and CTNNB1 and mutations of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA. There were 240 colorectal cancer-specific deaths and 427 all-cause deaths. The median follow-up of censored patients was 10.8 years (interquartile range: 7.2, 15.1). Compared with patients with no or weak expression of CASR, the multivariable HRs for colorectal cancer-specific mortality were 0.80 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.55–1.16] in patients with moderate CASR expression and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.32–0.79) in patients with intense CASR expression (p-trend = 0.003). The corresponding HRs for overall mortality were 0.85 (0.64–1.13) and 0.81 (0.58–1.12), respectively. Higher tumor CASR expression was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer-specific mortality.

The development of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, and a continuing decrease in the rates of other common neoplasms, such as lung and stomach since mid-1980s, prostate cancer has become one of the most common cancers among men. Prostate cancer (PC) is the second most common cancer in men, preceded only by lung cancer, and its early diagnosis is crucial for a successful treatment, that will prolong survival and improve quality of life. The main objective of our study was to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) in detecting prostatic pathologies and staging of prostate cancer by correlating these methods with histopathological results. Material/Methods: The study is a cross-sectional diagnostic study performed in 66 patients with a high degree of clinical suspicion of prostatic pathology. All patients underwent TRUS, T1W, T2W, DWI, and 3D PRESSMRS sequences, and we also calculated ADC values and Cho Cr/Cit MRS ratios for all patients. Results: Combination of MRI and MRS showed the highest diagnostic accuracy among the imaging modalities in detecting of prostatic neoplasm, followed by MRI, and then by TRUS. MRS plays a complementary role to MRI, by increasing its diagnostic accuracy. Due to a high cost, limited availability and increased scanning time, combination of MRI and MRS is currently not recommended as a first line investigation for detecting prostate neoplasms, hence USG (TRUS) remains the first line investigation due to its low cost, easy availability, time effectiveness and comparable efficacy. Conclusions: MRI MRS has more diagnostic accuracy than MRI alone for detection of prostate pathologies.

Understanding work experiences in a contemporary population-based sample is necessary to inform initiatives to reduce the burden of cancer care. METHODS: Women who were 20 to 79 years old and had been diagnosed with stage 0 to II breast cancer, as reported to the Georgia and Los Angeles Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries in 2014-2015, were surveyed. Of the 3672 eligible women, 2502 responded (68%); 1006 who reported working before their diagnosis were analyzed. Multivariate models evaluated correlates of missing work for >1 month and stopping work altogether versus missing work for ≤1 month. RESULTS: In this diverse sample, most patients (62%) underwent lumpectomy; 16% underwent unilateral mastectomy (8% with reconstruction); and 23% underwent bilateral mastectomy (19% with reconstruction). One-third (33%) received chemotherapy. Most (84%) worked full-time before their diagnosis; however, only 50% had paid sick leave, 39% had disability benefits, and 38% had flexible work schedules. Surgical treatment was strongly correlated with missing >1 month of work (odds ratio [OR] for bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction vs lumpectomy, 7.8) and with stopping work altogether (OR for bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction vs lumpectomy, 3.1). Chemotherapy receipt (OR for missing >1 month, 1.3; OR for stopping work altogether, 3.9) and race (OR for missing >1 month for blacks vs whites, 2.0; OR for stopping work altogether for blacks vs whites, 1.7) also correlated. Those with paid sick leave were less likely to stop working (OR, 0.5), as were those with flexible schedules (OR, 0.3). CONCLUSIONS: Working patients who received more aggressive treatments were more likely to experience substantial employment disruptions.

It has been well-documented that human microRNAs contribute in the disease development, such as cancers and obesity. While most microRNA functional studies heavily rely on the regulatory interactions between microRNAs and their target messenger RNAs, the accumulating evidence has shown that the altered availability of microRNAs, their target, and other types of endogenous RNAs competing are able to affect the microRNA-target interactions efficiently, which reflects the dynamic and conditional property of microRNA-mediated gene regulation. Here we present a new computational pipeline, miRDR-OSG, that utilizing the high-throughput computing resource provided by Open Science Grid to study the dynamic regulation of microRNAs in cancer development with the consideration of both competing and cooperative mechanisms. A large-scale genomic dataset from over four thousand patients with 9 major types of cancer was used to demonstrate the usage of miRDR-OSG. As a result, we identified 10,726 microRNA regulatory interactions that only occurred in a specific stage and/or cancer type.

However, a miRNA biomarker derived from the standard normal v.s tumor differential expression analysis is not robust, as its functional interactions with messenger-RNA targets may change between different lung cancer subtypes. Furthermore, as evidence suggests miRNA dysregulations and synergistic regulations are important to understanding many cancer diseases, it is important to consider the changes in miRNA-target associations among different lung cancer subtypes. We proposed a pipeline to identify miRNA synergistic modules with high context-specific functional similarity by constructing the MicroRNA Dysregulational Synergistic Network (MDSN). Then, we incorporated the extracted miRNA modules as prior knowledge to a Sparse Group Lasso classifier for more relevant selection of microRNA biomarkers, thereby improving classification results. We applied the method to the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma dataset and found extracted miRNA modules from independent subtypes differential analyses to have high agreement with known miRNA family assignments. Cross-validation test also demonstrates clustering miRNAs by considering the dysregulation between miRNAs and its targets results in more accurate prediction of cancer stage. © 2017 IEEE.","biomarker selection; group lasso; miRNA dysregulation; scale-free network",Conference Paper,Scopus

Although complete regression and long-term survival is achieved in some patients, but a large proportion of patients did not benefit from the therapy. Then, combination therapy can overcome this limitation. Pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy hade excellent performance and had become first line therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The objective response rate (ORR) of ipilimumab combined with nivolumab has significantly improved compared with nivolumab. Therefore, this combination therapy has been the first line therapy in patients with melanoma.

Almost 100% of AIS patients can be cured with complete resection. In contrast, the five-year survival rate for those diagnosed with invasive lung adenocarcinoma is only about 4%. In order to get a better understanding of adenocarcinoma and identify marks indicating its evaluation and progression, what needs to be done is a genome-wide evaluation of the disease. In this study, we used RNA-seq data from normal, AIS, and invasive lung cancer samples to identify gene module with differential gene expressions that represents the properties of AIS, distinct from normal and invasive tumor. Utilizing the differential expression patterns of protein-coding genes and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) between AIS and other conditions, we obtained a small group of 72 AIS-specific genes consisting 41 protein-coding genes, 5 annotated lncRNAs, and 26 novel lncRNA transcripts that expressed specifically in AIS samples. We consider that twelve of the protein-coding genes are lung cancer driver genes with located driver somatic mutations. Moreover, these AIS-specific genes show capabilities (98% accuracy in an independent data set) for indicating early stage lung cancer and normal situations. These genes are determined based on cell-adhesion functioning, including angiogenesis and fibronectin, etc., that are highly related to cancer development. The comparison of AIS with normal and invasive tumor provides the gene list revealing the mechanisms that accounts for AIS progression to invasive cancer. Furthermore we identified important signatures contributing to the early diagnosis of lung cancer, providing auxiliary studies to our ongoing precision medicine research. © 2017 IEEE.","Adenocarcinoma In Situ (AIS); Deep Belief Network (DBN); Deep Learning; Early Diagnosis; Invasive Lung Cancer; Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)",Conference Paper,Scopus

Methods: Patients with pathologically confirmed AS from 1994 to 2014 referred to Mount Sinai Hospital/Princess Margaret Cancer Centre were included. Primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes were disease-free survival (DFS), clinicopathologic characteristics, patterns of recurrence and factors predictive of survival. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests were used for OS and DFS. Results: Twenty-six patients were included: 6 with sporadic AS and 20 with RAAS. Median follow-up was 24 months. Five-year OS for RAAS and sporadic subgroups were 44% and 40%, respectively (P = ns). Five-year DFS for RAAS and sporadic subgroups were 23% and 20%, respectively (P = ns).

An effective screening program leading to early detection of disease would severely reduce the mortality of CRC. Alterations in the gut microbiota have been linked to CRC, but the potential of microbial markers for use in CRC screening has been largely unstudied. We used a nested case–control study of 238 study subjects to explore the use of microbial markers for clbA+ bacteria harboring the pks pathogenicity island, afa-C+ diffusely adherent Escherichia coli harboring the afa-1 operon, and Fusobacterium nucleatum in stool as potential screening markers for CRC. We found that individual markers for clbA+ bacteria and F. nucleatum were more abundant in stool of patients with CRC, and could predict cancer with a relatively high specificity (81.5% and 76.9%, respectively) and with a sensitivity of 56.4% and 69.2%, respectively. In a combined test of clbA+ bacteria and F. nucleatum, CRC was detected with a specificity of 63.1% and a sensitivity of 84.6%. Our findings support a potential value of microbial factors in stool as putative noninvasive biomarkers for CRC detection. We propose that microbial markers may represent an important future screening strategy for CRC, selecting patients with a “high-risk” microbial pattern to other further diagnostic procedures such as colonoscopy. © 2017 The Authors International Journal of Cancer published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of UICC","clbA; colorectal cancer; F. nucleatum; gut microbiota; screening; stool",Article,Scopus

Compared to Asian American women who did not have any of the metabolic conditions, those with 1, 2 or 3 conditions showed a steady increase in risk (respective odds ratios were 1.12, 1.42 and 1.62; P trend = 0.001) with adjustment for covariates including body mass index.

PB has also shown efficacy in many cancers and so far, all of its anti-tumor activity has been attributed to the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition. As PDK1/PDH controls the critical switch between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in cancer cells, PDK1 is a key target in tumor metabolism for anti-cancer treatment. We hypothesize that the therapeutic effects of PB in cancers might also depend on suppressing PDK1 and promoting PDH activity, in addition to its proposed role as HDAC inhibitor. We showed that PB directly inhibited the kinase activity of PDK1 and increased the activity of PDH in an enzyme assay. In several different cancer cell lines, PB reduced the phosphorylation level of PDH, increased the mitochondrial respiration, decreased glycolysis in cytoplasm, reversed mitochondrial hyperpolarization, activated several proteins in apoptotic signaling pathway and then induced the apoptosis of cells. In summary, this is the first study indicated that PB could exert its anti-cancer effects through inhibiting PDK1, altering the mitochondrial bioenergetics and inducing apoptosis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cancer; Phenyl butyrate; Pyruvate dehydrogenase; Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1; Tumor metabolism",Article,Scopus

Although Pasifika women have a lower incidence of breast cancer compared to New Zealand European women, they have higher breast cancer mortality and lower five-year survival. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics and tumour biology of Pasifika women and to compare New Zealand European women to identify what factors impact on early (Stage 1 and 2) vs advanced stage (Stage 3 and 4) at diagnosis. METHOD: Data on all Pasifika and New Zealand European women diagnosed with breast cancer (C50) during the period 1 June 2000 to 31 May 2013 was extracted from the Auckland and Waikato Breast Cancer Registries. Descriptive tables and Chi-square test were used to examine di erences in characteristics and tumour biology between Pasifika and New Zealand European women. Logistic regression was used to identify factors that contributed to an increased risk of advanced stage at diagnosis. RESULTS: A significantly higher proportion of Pasifika women had advanced disease at diagnosis compared to New Zealand European women (33.3% and 18.3%, respectively). Cancer biology in Pasifika women was more likely to be: 1) HER2+, 2) ER/PR negative and 3) have a tumour size of ≥50mm. Pasifika women live in higher deprivation areas of 9–10 compared to New Zealand European women (55% vs 14%, respectively) and were less likely to have their cancer identified through screening. Logistic regression showed that if Pasifika women were on the screen-detected pathway they had similar odds (not sig.) of having advanced disease at diagnosis to New Zealand European women. CONCLUSION: Mode of detection, deprivation, age and some biological factors contributed to the di erence in odds ratio between Pasifika and New Zealand European women. For those of screening age, adherence to the screening programme and improvements in access to earlier diagnosis for Pasifika women under the current screening age have the potential to make a substantial di erence in the number of Pasifika women presenting with late-stage disease. © NZMA.",,Article,Scopus

When stratified by age, 93.7%, 92.1%, 90.8%, 87.6%, 80.9%, and 55.2% of high-risk patients and 96.1%, 94.7%, 93.4%, 89.7%, 82.7%, and 62.8% of intermediate-risk patients ages <60, 60 to 64, 65 to 69, 70 to 74, 75 to 79, and ≥80 years received definitive therapy, respectively. For both high-risk and intermediate-risk patients, increasing age was significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving definitive therapy overall (both P <.001) and a greater likelihood of receiving primary ADT among those who did not receive definitive therapy (both P <.001). CONCLUSIONS: Older age was significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving definitive therapy and an increased likelihood of receiving primary ADT in this national cohort of patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk prostate cancer. Notably, approximately 40% to 45% of patients aged ≥80 years did not receive definitive therapy. These findings are alarming given the dismal outcomes of conservatively managed unfavorable-risk prostate cancer.

Using data from1992-2013 from 13 US cancer registries in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we assessed such disparities according to histological type, based on a variety of disparity metrics. The age-standardized incidence rate of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was highest among black persons, while adenocarcinoma mainly affected white men. The rate of SCC decreased over time in all racial/ethnic groups, and this was most pronounced in black persons (by 5.7%per year among men and 5.0%among women). The adenocarcinoma rate rose among non-Hispanic whites and among black men. Racial/ethnic disparities in the incidence of total esophageal cancer decreased over time, which was duemainly to reduced disparities in SCC. The 2 absolute disparity measures - range difference and between-group variance - for adenocarcinoma rose by 3.2%and 6.8% per year, respectively, in men and by 1.8%and 5.3% per year, respectively, in women.

Methods: Tumor lengths were examined retrospectively for 389 esophagectomy patients with respect to Endoscopy, EUS (Endoscopic Ultrasound), CT and PET-CT, and pathology. Correlations between the measurements on the different approaches were assessed, and associations between tumor length and survival were analyzed. Results: Only the tumor lengths assessed on pathology were found to be significantly associated with overall (P = 0.001) and recurrence free (P < 0.001) survival on univariable analysis. The median overall survival was 47.1 months in those patients with tumor lengths <3.0 cm, falling to 19.6 and 18.0 months in those with 3.0-4.4 and 4.5+ cm tumors, respectively, demonstrating a reduction in patient survival at a tumor length of around 3 cm. Tumor length on pathology was significantly correlated with tumor differentiation and both T- and N-categories. After accounting for these factors, tumor length on pathology was a significant independent predictor of recurrence-free (P = 0.016), but not overall (P = 0.128) survival. Conclusions: Tumor lengths on pathology were found to be the most predictive of patient outcome.

On May 20, 2013, our institution changed the definition of negative margins from 2 mm to “no ink on tumor.”. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of patients who had surgery at our institution with clinical stage I/II breast cancers between June 1, 2011 and May 1, 2015. In the pre-guideline cohort (pre) and post-guideline cohort (post), negative margins were 2 mm and “no ink on tumor,” respectively. Results: Implementation of the guideline resulted in a significant decrease in the positive/close margin rate (29.6% pre vs 10.1% post; P < 0.001) and numerical decrease in re-excision rate (20.4% pre vs 16.3% post; P = 0.104). No significant difference was found in local recurrence between the cohorts with limited follow-up (1.2% pre vs 1.5% post; P = 0.787). Conclusion: The implementation of the “no ink on tumor” guideline at our institution has resulted in a significant decrease in positive margin rates and a numerical decrease in margin re-excisions.

The authors updated these findings and examined survival by stage and race. METHODS: The authors used data from the CONCORD-2 study for males (ages 15-99 years) who were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 37 states, covering 80% of the US population. Survival was adjusted for background mortality (net survival) using state-specific and race-specific life tables and was age-standardized. Data were presented for 2001 through 2003 and 2004 through 2009 to account for changes in collecting SEER Summary Stage 2000. RESULTS: Among the 1,527,602 prostate cancers diagnosed between 2001 and 2009, the proportion of localized cases increased from 73% to 77% in black males and from 77% to 79% in white males. Although the proportion of distant-stage cases was higher among black males than among white males, they represented less than 6% of cases in both groups between 2004 and 2009. Net survival exceeded 99% for localized stage between 2004 and 2009 in both racial groups. Overall, and in most states, 5-year net survival exceeded 95%. CONCLUSIONS: Prostate cancer survival has increased since the first CONCORD study, and the racial gap has narrowed. Earlier detection of localized cancers likely contributed to this finding. However, racial disparities also were observed in overall survival. To help understand which factors might contribute to the persistence of this disparity, states could use local data to explore sociodemographic characteristics, such as survivors’ health insurance status, health literacy, treatment decision-making processes, and treatment preferences.

The effects of this requirement on enrollment rates, enrollment durations, and patient selection have not been fully elucidated. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed data generated by patients who consented to 1 or more interventional lung cancer clinical trials at the University of California-Los Angeles Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center between January 2013 and December 2014. Trials were considered to require a biopsy when enrollment was conditional on the procurement of tissue without intervening therapy between procurement and enrollment. RESULTS: In total, 311 patients underwent 368 screening incidents for 1 or more of 19 trials. Trials that required a new biopsy had a longer median screening duration (34 vs 14 days) than trials that did not require a biopsy (P <.001). Trials that required a biopsy had a greater screen failure rate (49.1% vs 26.5%; P <.001), which was largely driven by patients who did not undergo the required biopsy or lacked the required biomarker. Worsening performance status led to the majority of screen failures (56.5%) among biomarker-eligible patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although the scientific benefits of obtaining a new biopsy and requiring specific results for trial enrollment are clear, these requirements lead to a lengthening of the screening period, which, in some patients, is associated with clinical decline before enrollment. Implications for the interpretation of data from studies of this design should be explored.

However, such somatic aberration and its association with prognostic factors have neither been studied in aWest African population nor been systematically reviewed in the context of racial differences. We used immunohistochemistry to assess oncoprotein encoded by the ERG gene as the established surrogate of ERG fusion genes among 262 prostate cancer biopsies from the Ghana Prostate Study (2004-2006). Poisson regression with robust variance estimation provided prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals of ERG expression in relation to patient characteristics. We found that 47 of 262 (18%) prostate cancers were ERG-positive, and being negative for ERG staining was associated with higher Gleason score. We further conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of TMPRSS2:ERG fusions in relation to race, Gleason score, and tumor stage, combining results from Ghana with 40 additional studies. Meta-analysis showed the prevalence of TMPRSS2:ERG fusions in prostate cancer to be highest in men of European descent (49%), followed by men of Asian (27%) and then African (25%) descent. The lower prevalence of TMPRSS2:ERG fusions in men of African descent implies that alternative genomic mechanisms might explain the disproportionately high prostate cancer burden in such populations. © The Author(s) 2017.

METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods study on a prospective cohort of hospitalized patients with advanced cancer. Two physicians used a consensus-driven medical record review to characterize processes that led to code status order transitions from full code to DNR. RESULTS: In total, 1047 hospitalizations were reviewed among 728 patients. Admitting clinicians did not address code status in 53% of hospitalizations, resulting in code status orders of “presumed full.” In total, 275 patients (26.3%) transitioned from full code to DNR, and 48.7% (134 of 275 patients) of those had an order of “presumed full” at admission; however, upon further clarification, the patients expressed that they had wished to be DNR before the hospitalization. We identified 3 additional processes leading to order transition from full code to DNR acute clinical deterioration (15.3%), discontinuation of cancer-directed therapy (17.1%), and education about the potential harms/futility of CPR (15.3%). Compared with discontinuing therapy and education, transitions because of acute clinical deterioration were associated with less patient involvement (P =.002), a shorter time to death (P <.001), and a greater likelihood of inpatient death (P =.005). CONCLUSIONS: One-half of code status order changes among hospitalized patients with advanced cancer were because of full code orders in patients who had a preference for DNR before hospitalization.

N-myristoyltransferases (NMT) catalyze co- or posttranslational myristoylation of Src family kinases and other oncogenic proteins, thereby regulating their function. In this study, we provide genetic and pharmacologic evidence that inhibiting the N-myristoyltransferase NMT1 suppresses cell-cycle progression, proliferation, and malignant growth of prostate cancer cells. Loss of myristoylation abolished the tumorigenic potential of Src and its synergy with androgen receptor in mediating tumor invasion. We identified the myristoyl-CoA analogue B13 as a small-molecule inhibitor of NMT1 enzymatic activity. B13 exposure blocked Src myristoylation and Src localization to the cytoplasmic membrane, attenuating Src-mediated oncogenic signaling. B13 exerted its anti-invasive and antitumor effects against prostate cancer cells, with minimal toxic side-effects in vivo. Structural optimization based on structure–activity relationships enabled the chemical synthesis of LCL204, with enhanced inhibitory potency against NMT1.

The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene plays an important role in the DNA DSB repair pathway. DNA damage is a major cytotoxic effect that can be caused by radiation, and the ability to repair DNA after damage varies among different tissues. Impaired DNA repair pathways are associated with high sensitivity to radiation exposure. Hence, ATM gene polymorphisms are thought to influence the risk of cancer and radiation-induced pneumonitis (RP) risk in cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. However, the results of previous studies are inconsistent. We therefore conducted this comprehensive meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) and Wanfang databases to identify studies that investigated the association between the ATM gene polymorphisms and both lung cancer and RP radiotherapy-treated lung cancer (the last search was conducted on Dec.10, 2015). The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to investigate the strength of these relationships. Funnel plots and Begg's and Egger's tests were conducted to assess the publication bias. All analyses were performed in STATA 13.0 software. Results: Ten eligible case-control studies (4731 cases and 5142 controls) on lung cancer susceptibility and four (192 cases and 772 controls) on RP risk were included. The results of the overall and subgroup analyses indicated that in the ATM gene, the rs189037 (-111G>A, -4519G>A), rs664677 (44831C>T, 49238C>T) and rs664143 (131,717T>G) polymorphisms were significantly associated with lung cancer susceptibility (OR=1.21, 95% CI=1.04-1.39, P=0.01; OR=1.26, 95% CI=1.06-1.49, P=0.01; OR=1.43, 95% CI=1.15-1.78, P<0.01). Additionally, the rs189037 variant was significantly associated with RP risk (OR=1.74, 95% CI=1.02-2.97, P=0.04). No publication bias was found in the funnel plots, Begg's tests or Egger's tests. Conclusions: The results indicate that the ATM rs189037, rs664677 and rs664143 gene polymorphisms are risk factors for lung cancer, while the ATM rs189037 variant was significantly associated with RP risk. © 2017 The Author(s).","Ataxia telangiectasia mutated; Lung cancer; Meta-analysis; Polymorphism; Radiation-induced pneumonitis",Article,Scopus

This study combined for the first time the HSP90 inhibitor ganetespib (Gan) and the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib (Carf) to target key mechanisms of homeostasis in pancreatic cancer. It was hypothesized that Gan plus Carf would elicit potent antitumor activity by modulating complementary homeostatic processes. METHODS: In vitro and in vivo effects of this combination on mechanisms of cell growth and viability were evaluated with human pancreatic cancer cell lines (MIA PaCa-2 and HPAC). RESULTS: Combined treatment with Gan and Carf significantly decreased cell viability. The mechanism varied by cell line and involved G2-M cell-cycle arrest accompanied by a consistent reduction in key cell-cycle regulatory proteins and concomitant upregulation of p27. Further studies revealed increased autophagy markers, including the upregulation of autophagy related 7 and light chain 3 cleavage, and evidence of apoptosis (increased Bax expression and processing of caspase 3). Immunoblot analyses confirmed the modulation of other pathways that influence cell viability, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and nuclear factor κB. Finally, the treatment of athymic mice bearing HPAC tumors with Gan and Carf significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo. An immunoblot analysis of freshly isolated tumors from animals at the end of the study confirmed in vivo modulation of key signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal Gan plus Carf to be a promising combination with synergistic antiproliferative, apoptotic, and pro-autophagy effects in preclinical studies of pancreatic cancer and will further the exploration of the utility of this treatment combination in clinical trials.

We evaluated AR CN in cfDNA using 2 different real-time PCR assays and 2 reference genes (RNaseP and AGO1). DNA amount of 60 ng was used for each assay combination. AR CN gain was confirmed using Digital PCR as a more accurate method. CN variation analysis has already been demonstrated to be informative for the prediction of treatment resistance in the setting of mCRPC, but it could be useful also for other purposes in different patient settings.

A growing body of epidemiological evidence links diabetes to several types of cancer but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. The signalling cascade connecting insulin and FOXO proteins provides a compelling example for a conserved pathway at the interface between insulin signalling and cancer. FOXOs are transcription factors that orchestrate programs of gene expression known to control a variety of processes in response to cellular stress. Genes regulated by this family of proteins are involved in the regulation of cellular energy production, oxidative stress resistance and cell viability and proliferation. Accordingly, FOXO factors have been shown to play an important role in the suppression of tumour growth and in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis.

Patients and Methods: The study comprised 588 patients with a non-pathologic complete response who received anthracycline and/or taxane-based regimens in NAC setting. HER2 status was assessed before NAC and in residual invasive tumor of the surgical specimens. The associations between the change in HER2 status and clinicopathological factors were assessed. Results: Before NAC, 489 (83%) of the 588 patients had HER2-negative tumors and 99 patients (17%) had HER2-positive tumors. Eleven (2.2%) of the HER2-negative tumors changed to HER2-positive, while 33 (33%) of the HER2-positive tumors changed to HER2-negative. ER and PR-positivity before NAC were associated with loss of HER2-positivity, whereas receiving trastuzumab was not. In terms of disease-free survival, there was no difference between patients with and those without change in HER2 status after NAC in either the patients with HER2-negative tumors (P = 0.26) or with HER2-positive tumors before NAC (P = 0.23). Conclusion: Our results showed that changes in HER2 status did not affect patients’ prognosis.

Accordingly, among 190,325 postmenopausal participants in the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study (1995-2011), we compared the association between risk factors and incident ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS; n = 1,453) with that of risk factors and invasive ductal carcinomas (n = 7,525); in addition, we compared the association between risk factors and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS; n = 186) with that of risk factors and invasive lobular carcinomas (n = 1,191). Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated from multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. We used case-only multivariable logistic regression to test for heterogeneity in associations. Younger age at menopause was associated with a higher risk of DCIS but lower risks of LCIS and invasive ductal carcinomas (P for heterogeneity < 0.01). Prior breast biopsy was more strongly associated with the risk of LCIS than the risk of DCIS (P for heterogeneity = 0.04). Increased risks associated with use of menopausal hormone therapy were stronger for LCIS than DCIS (P for heterogeneity = 0.03) and invasive lobular carcinomas (P for heterogeneity < 0.01). Associations were similar for race, age at menarche, age at first birth, family history, alcohol consumption, and smoking status, which suggests thatmost risk factor associations are similar for in situ and invasive cancers and may influence early stages of tumorigenesis. The differential associations observed for various factors may provide important clues for understanding the etiology of certain breast cancers. © The Author(s) 2017.

The Kaplan- Meier method and Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate genotype associations with overall mortality at 36 months postdiagnosis, adjusting for age, sex, race, and tumor stage. Results: Patients homozygous for the minor allele (GG) of rs942190 had poorer survival compared with those carrying AA alleles, with a HR of 1.36 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08- 1.72, P= 0.01), but no association with survival was observed for patients carrying the AG genotype (HR = 1.04, 95% CI, 0.84- 1.29, P = 0.72).

With three PARPi now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, olaparib (Lynparza™), niraparib (Zejula™), and rucaparib (Rubraca™) in 2014 (and 2017 for the tablet formulation), 2016, and 2017, respectively, these drugs have now entered routine clinical practice. The marked single-agent efficacy of PARPi either as maintenance following response to platinum-based chemotherapy or as up-front treatment in these indications is based on the well-known concept of synthetic lethality. PARPi themselves work by blocking the repair of single-strand DNA breaks by the base excision/single-strand break repair pathway and can also be directly cytotoxic by the mechanism of PARP trapping. The greatest benefit in terms of progression-free survival, in all three PARPi maintenance registration studies, was seen in women with platinum-sensitive BRCA mutation-associated HGSOC. However, it is clear that non-BRCA HGSOC can benefit from PARPi and the ongoing challenge of biomarker driven studies is how best to define these patients. PARPi are well tolerated, but more information is needed to assess the longer-term/later onset toxicities as these agents are investigated in the first-line setting. The future direction and challenges for PARPi will be to continue to expand beyond BRCA and ovarian cancer by identifying molecular or functional signatures of response; to see if the durable responses in ovarian cancer can be improved and efficacy can be achieved in other cancer sub-types by combining with novel targeted agents.

RESULTS: A total of 81 eligible patients were identified and included in the study. The average overall survival in the studied cohort was 46.59 months (95%CI = 39.11-54.06). Patients that were optimally debulked and patients that had a platinum-free interval larger than 12 months had significantly longer survival in the current series (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: the average overall survival of advanced stage HGSC patients in the studied series was 46.59 months (95%CI = 39.11-54.06). Patients aged 65 years or younger tended to live approximately ten months longer than patients older than 65 years, but this difference was not statistically significant. There was no difference in HGSC survival in the groups of patients with grade 2 and grade 3 disease. However, optimal surgical debulking and platinum sensitivity were associated with significantly better overall survival. © 2017 Igor Aluloski, Mile Tanturovski, Rubens Jovanovic, Slavica Kostadinova-Kunovska, Gordana Petrusevska, Igor Stojkovski, Bojana Petreska.","High grade; Ovarian cancer; Surgical cytoreduction; Survival",Article,Scopus

A retrospective, single-center study. Objective. Investigation of the changes in the treatment outcomes of patients with lung cancer derived metastatic spine tumors. Summary of Background Data. Metastatic spine tumors derived from lung cancer had been progressive, and their prognosis is poor. It has recently been reported that the use of molecularly targeted drugs and bone-modifying agents (BMAs) improved the treatment outcomes of patients with lung cancer, but no detailed information about the treatment of metastatic spine tumors has been reported. Methods. Two hundred seven patients with lung cancer derived metastatic spine tumors who were examined after 2000 were analyzed. They were divided into 54 patients who were treated in or before 2005 (surgical treatment: 25 patients, conservative treatment: 29 patients) (group B) and 153 patients who were treated from 2006 onwards, when a molecularly targeted drug and BMA were introduced (surgical treatment: 24, conservative treatment: 129) (group A), and the treatment outcomes of the two groups were compared. Results. Significant differences in age and the affected vertebral level, paralysis grade, and Tokuhashi score (general condition, the number of vertebral metastases, and the total score) were detected between the groups. Regarding treatment outcomes, the mean duration of the post-treatment survival period was 5.1 and 9.3 months in groups B and A, respectively, that is, it was significantly longer in group A (P<0.05). No significant intergroup difference in pain improvement was noted, and no significant post-treatment improvement in paralysis was achieved in either group. The post-treatment discharge-to-home eligibility rate did not differ significantly between the groups, but the Barthel Index improved significantly after treatment in group A (P<0.05). Conclusion. After molecularly targeted drugs and BMA were introduced as treatments for lung cancer derived metastatic spine tumors, the survival periods of patients with such tumors increased, and their activity of daily living after treatment improved. © Copyright 2017 The Author(s).

Therefore, more sensitive and early diagnostic methods for CRC are urgently needed. In this study, an efficient electrochemical biosensor for early diagnosis of adenoma-to-carcinoma progression that employs a series of chemically modified affinity peptides was developed. A series of amino acid-substituted and cysteine-incorporated synthetic peptides with flexible linkers was chemically synthesized and immobilized to a gold sensor layer; performance of the sensor was monitored using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Potential affinity peptides (LRG1 BP1–BP4) specific for the LRG1 biomarker as a target protein were chosen according to a quantitative current decrease and dynamic impedance increase by CV and EIS, respectively. Using EIS, the Kd value of the LRG1 BP3 peptide was found to be 8.3 ± 2.7 nM. The applicability of the sensor to detect LRG1 proteins was confirmed in human plasma from colorectal adenomas and carcinomas (n = 20 in each group). The detection of LRG1 in accordance with the ΔRct value (electron-transfer resistance at the electrode surface) of the sensor layer incorporating LRG1 BP3 peptides showed a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.001) between adenomas and carcinomas, indicating that the potential use of this biosensing platform for detecting the CRC biomarker, as well as for monitoring the colorectal adenoma-to-carcinoma transition in an electrochemically miniaturized biosensor (e-chem biosensor) in point-of-care testing, is possible. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Affinity peptide; Colon cancer; Electrochemical sensor; LRG1; Sensitivity",Article,Scopus

For that goal we built denoising autoencoders (DAE) and stacked denoising autoencoders and we studied the influence of the input nodes on the final representation of the DAE. We have also compared these deep learning approaches with other existing approaches. Our study is divided into two main tasks. First, we built and compared the performance of several feature extraction methods as well as data sampling methods using classifiers that were able to distinguish the samples of thyroid cancer patients from samples of healthy persons. In the second task, we have investigated the possibility of building comprehensible descriptions of gene expression data by using Denoising Autoencoders and Stacked Denoising Autoencoders as feature extraction methods. After extracting information related to the description built by the network, namely the connection weights, we devised post-processing techniques to extract comprehensible and biologically meaningful descriptions out of the constructed models.

One of a critical step to identify target molecules is to determine the most representative features for different patient's sub-groups. Breast cancer, one of the most heterogeneous cancer has five main subtypes, so accurately identify gene signatures associated with intrinsic subtypes based on currently available data resource will benefit for precision medicine. Traditional ways to identify subtype-specific targeted molecular biomarkers are based on the platforms such as microarray, or immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers. Very few studies using RNAseq data to predict cancer subtype, due to the limited data resource. Gene expression in RNAseq platform is highly correlated with the microarray. However, it shows superior benefits than microarray in many ways, such as detection of low abundance transcripts, the broader dynamic range of gene expression in both coding and non-coding genes. Therefore, RNAseq platform will become the predominant tool for transcriptome analysis in the long term. To benefit the identification of molecule targets for transcriptomic data including RNAseq and microarray expression, we developed a new feature selection method. Our results of classification accuracy for intrinsic subtypes and prognostic evaluation of selected genes outperform than the traditional PAM50 gene signature, which is derived from microarray and widely used in clinical practice. © 2017 IEEE.","breast cancer; gene signature; intrinsic subtypes; machine learning; survival analysis",Conference Paper,Scopus

An unhealthy lifestyle is a well-known risk factor for this disease. Multiple randomised controlled trials have shown that screening programmes with faecal occult blood tests (FOBT), guaiac-FOBT (gFOBT) and immunochemical FOBT (iFOBT), represent a good prevention strategy. More early stage cancers can be detected through these programmes and the mortality rate can be reduced. Most studies favour iFOBT, because it is easy to use and has a higher detection rate, which results in a higher uptake of screening. A higher uptake is also achieved by mailing of the test, instead of obtaining it from the general practitioner, and by use of reminder letters. Overall the uptake of screening is higher in women than in men, although more cancers are diagnosed in men than in women. This can be explained by a lower sensitivity of FOBT in women. Furthermore, there is a strong correlation between a low socio-economic status and a low uptake of screening. Caucasians and natives possibly have a higher uptake. The screening age lies between 50-74 years. There is a higher uptake among people of 65-69 years.

Consideration of body composition may be useful in individualizing chemotherapy dosing, but to the authors' knowledge few studies to date have examined the association of body composition with chemotherapy tolerance in patients with colon cancer. METHODS: The authors identified patients with nonmetastatic colon cancer who were diagnosed from 2006 through 2011 at Kaiser Permanente and who received leucovorin calcium/calcium folinate, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as initial adjuvant chemotherapy (533 patients). Patients' muscle mass was quantified using clinically acquired computed tomography scans. The authors quantified chemotherapy doses, treatment dates, and related toxicities using the electronic medical record. In logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage of disease, the authors examined associations of muscle tertiles with early treatment discontinuation (&lt;6 cycles), treatment delay (&gt;3 days off schedule for ≥3 times), and/or dose reduction (relative dose intensity ≤ 0.70, based on planned treatment). RESULTS: The average age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 58.7 years; BSA was 1.9 m2 and body mass index was 28.7 kg/m2. Compared with the highest sex-specific tertile of muscle mass, patients in the lowest tertile were more likely to experience toxicities and had twice the risk of adverse outcomes while receiving FOLFOX; for early discontinuation, the odds ratio (OR) was 2.34 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.04-5.24; P for trend =.03), whereas the ORs were 2.24 (95% CI, 1.37-3.66; P for trend =.002) for treatment delay and 2.28 (95% CI, 1.19-4.36; P for trend =.01) for dose reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Lower muscle mass is associated with greater toxicity and poor chemotherapy adherence among patients receiving FOLFOX. Many chemotherapy drugs are dosed based on BSA, but treatment may be better individualized if muscle mass is considered.

This is particularly so in more metastatic tumors where changes in the karyoplasmic ratio are used in both diagnosis and prognosis for several tumor types. However, the direction of nuclear size changes differs for particular tumor types: for example in breast cancer, larger nuclear size correlates with increased metastasis, while for lung cancer smaller nuclear size correlates with increased metastasis. Thus, there must be tissue-specific drivers of the nuclear size changes, but proteins thus far linked to nuclear size regulation are widely expressed. Notably, for these tumor types, ploidy changes have been excluded as the basis for nuclear size changes, and so, the increased metastasis is more likely to have a basis in the nuclear morphology change itself. We review what is known about nuclear size regulation and postulate how such nuclear size changes can increase metastasis and why the directionality can differ for particular tumor types. © 2017 The Author(s).",,Review,Scopus

Many malignant tumors, including papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and ATC, are associated with increased expression of ICAM-1, providing a rationale for utilizing ICAM-1-targeting agents for the treatment of aggressive cancer. We developed a third-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting ICAM-1 to leverage adoptive T-cell therapy as a new treatment modality. Experimental Design: ICAM-1 CAR T cells were applied to multiple malignant and nonmalignant target cells to investigate specific target cell death and ""off-tumor"" toxicity in vitro. In vivo therapeutic efficacy of ICAM-1 CAR T cells was examined in ATC mouse models established from a cell line and patient-derived tumors that rapidly develop systemic metastases. Results: ICAM-1 CAR T cells demonstrated robust and specific killing of PTC and ATC cell lines in vitro. Interestingly, although certain ATC cell lines showed heterogeneous levels of ICAM-1 expression, addition of cytotoxic CAR T cells induced increased ICAM-1 expression such that all cell lines became targetable. In mice with systemic ATC, a single administration of ICAM-1 CAR T cells mediated profound tumor killing that resulted in long-term remission and significantly improved survival. Patient-derived ATC cells overexpressed ICAM-1 and were largely eliminated by autologous ICAM-1 CAR T cells in vitro and in animal models.

We previously found that cancer-derived IL-6 induces T cell suppression of MDSCs in vitro via the activation of STAT3/IDO signaling pathway. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We found that in primary breast cancer tissues, cancer-derived IL-6 was positively correlated with infiltration of MDSCs in situ, which was accompanied by more aggressive tumor phenotypes and worse clinical outcomes. In vitro IL-6 stimulated the amplification of MDSCs and promoted their T cell suppression ability, which were fully inhibited by an IL-6-specific blocking antibody. Our results demonstrate that IL-6-dependent suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) suppression in MDSCs induced phosphorylation of the JAK1, JAK2, TYK2, STAT1, and STAT3 proteins, which was correlated with T cell suppression of MDSCs in vitro. Therefore, dysfunction in the SOCS feedback loop promoted long-term activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and predominantly contributed to IL-6-mediated effects on MDSCs. Furthermore, IL-6-induced inhibition of SOCS3 and activation of the JAK/STAT pathway was correlated with an elevated expression of IL-6 receptor a (CD126), in which the soluble CD126-mediated IL-6 trans-signaling pathway significantly regulated IL-6-mediated effects on MDSCs. Finally, IL-6-induced SOCS3 dysfunction and sustained activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway promoted the amplification and immunosuppressive function of breast cancer MDSCs in vitro and in vivo, and thus blocking the IL-6 signaling pathway is a promising therapeutic strategy for eliminating and inhibiting MDSCs to improve prognosis. © 2017 Jiang, Chen, Zhang, Zhang, Ye, Liu, Yu, Wei, Ren and Yu.","Breast cancer; Interleukin-6; Myeloid-derived suppressor cells; Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3; The JAK/STAT signaling pathway; Trans-signaling pathway",Article,Scopus

The presence of serum antibodies to HPV-16 early (E) antigens is associated with an increased risk for OPC. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of antibodies to a panel of HPV-16 E antigens in screening for OPC. METHODS: This case-control study included 378 patients with OPC, 153 patients with nonoropharyngeal head and neck cancer (non-OPC), and 782 healthy control subjects. The tumor HPV status was determined with p16 immunohistochemistry and HPV in situ hybridization. HPV-16 E antibody levels in serum were identified with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A trained binary logistic regression model based on the combination of all E antigens was predefined and applied to the data set. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay for distinguishing HPV-related OPC from controls were calculated. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for the association of head and neck cancer with the antibody status. RESULTS: Of the 378 patients with OPC, 348 had p16-positive OPC. HPV-16 E antibody levels were significantly higher among patients with p16-positive OPC but not among patients with non-OPC or among controls. Serology showed high sensitivity and specificity for HPV-related OPC (binary classifier: 83% sensitivity and 99% specificity for p16-positive OPC). CONCLUSIONS: A trained binary classification algorithm that incorporates information about multiple E antibodies has high sensitivity and specificity and may be advantageous for risk stratification in future screening trials.

This report describes the survival of children with ALL in the United States using the most comprehensive and up-to-date cancer registry data. METHODS: Data from 37 state cancer registries that cover approximately 80% of the US population were used. Age-standardized survival up to 5 years was estimated for children aged 0-14 years who were diagnosed with ALL during 2 periods (2001-2003 and 2004-2009). RESULTS: In total, 17,500 children with ALL were included. The pooled age-standardized net survival estimates for all US registries combined were 95% at 1 year, 90% at 3 years, and 86% at 5 years for children diagnosed during 2001-2003, and 96%, 91%, and 88%, respectively, for those diagnosed during 2004-2009. Black children who were diagnosed during 2001-2003 had lower 5-year survival (84%) than white children (87%) and had less improvement in survival by 2004-2009. For those diagnosed during 2004-2009, the 1-year and 5-year survival estimates were 96% and 89%, respectively, for white children and 96% and 84%, respectively, for black children. During 2004-2009, survival was highest among children aged 1 to 4 years (95%) and lowest among children aged <1 year (60%). CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicate that overall net survival from childhood ALL in the United States is high, but disparities by race still exist, especially beyond the first year after diagnosis. Clinical and public health strategies are needed to improve health care access, clinical trial enrollment, treatment, and survivorship care for children with ALL. Cancer 2017;123:5178-89.

We tested this hypothesis by evaluating the association between urinary PGE2 metabolites (PGE-M), a biomarker of in vivo PGE2 overproduction, and pancreatic cancer risk. We conducted a case–control study with 722 subjects (239 cases and 483 controls) nested within two prospective cohort studies, the Shanghai Women's Health Study (SWHS) and Shanghai Men's Health Study (SMHS). Pre-diagnosis urine samples were measured for PGE-M using a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric method. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI), with adjustment for potential confounders. Compared to those with the lowest urine level of PGE-M (the first quartile), individuals with higher urine levels of PGE-M had an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer, with adjusted ORs (95%CI) of 1.63 (0.98–2.73), 1.55 (0.90–2.69) and 1.94 (1.07–3.51), for the second to the fourth quartile groups, respectively (p for trend = 0.054).

After excluding cases diagnosed in the first year of follow-up and their matched controls, this positive association persisted (p for trend = 0.037) and the interaction became statistically significant (p for interaction = 0.017).

We also examined 3'-deoxy-30-[18F]fluorothymidine ([18F]FLT) PET as a means to predict therapeutic response to a sequential combination of capecitabine and trifluridine/tipiracil. [3H]FLT uptake after 5-fluorouracil treatment in vitro and [18F]FLT uptake after capecitabine (360 mg/kg/day) in athymic nude mice (Balb/c-nu) with xenografts (n = 10-12 per group) were measured using eight human colon cancer cell lines.

We observed significant increases in [3H]FLT uptake in all cell lines and [18F]FLT uptake in five xenograft models after 5-fluorouracil and capecitabine treatment, respectively. Increased [18F]FLT uptake after capecitabine followed by extinction of uptake correlated strongly with tumor growth inhibition (r = -0.81, P = 0.02). The effects of these combinations were synergistic in vitro. A synergy for sequential capecitabine and trifluridine/tipiracil was found only inmouse xenograftmodels showing increased [18F]FLT uptake after capecitabine.

The assessment of tumor regression remains difficult and inaccurate with existing methods. Dual Energy Computed Tomography (DECT) enables qualitative tissue differentiation by simultaneous scanning with different levels of energy. We aimed to assess the feasibility of DECT in quantifying tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy in loco-advanced rectal cancer. Methods: We enrolled 11 patients with histological and MRI verified loco-advanced rectal adenocarcinoma and followed up on them prospectively. All patients had one DECT scanning before neoadjuvant treatment and one 12 weeks after using the spectral imaging scan mode. DECT analyzing tools were used to determine the average quantitative parameters; effective-Z, water- and iodine-concentration, Dual Energy Index (DEI), and Dual Energy Ratio (DER). These parameters were compared to the regression in the resection specimen as measured by the pathologist. Results: Changes in the quantitative parameters differed significantly after treatment in comparison with pre-treatment, and the results were different in patients with different CRT response rates.

In-vivo and in-vitro studies showed its anti-tumor and immunomodulatory properties signifying it as a potent drug candidate for study. The studies of mechanisms of cell movement are relevant which can be understood by knowing the involvement of genes in an effect of a drug. Although cytotoxicity and anti-proliferative activity of artemisinin is evident, the genes participating in its anti-migratory and reduced invasive effect are not well studied. The present study reports the alteration in the expression of 84 genes involved in cell motility upon artemisinin treatment in MCF-7 breast cancer cells using pathway focused gene expression PCR array. In addition, the effect of artemisinin on epigenetic modifier HDACs is studied. Methods: We checked the functional stimulus of artemisinin on cell viability, migration, invasion and apoptosis in breast cancerous cell lines. Using qRT-PCR and western blot, we validated the altered expression of relevant genes associated with proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis and mammary gland development. Results: Artemisinin inhibited cell proliferation of estrogen receptor negative breast cancer cells with fewer efficacies in comparison to estrogen receptor positive ones. At the same time, cell viability and proliferation of normal breast epithelial MCF10A cells was un-affected. Artemisinin strongly inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion. Along with orphan nuclear receptors (ERRα, ERRβ and ERRγ), artemisinin altered the ERα/ERβ/PR/Her expression status of MCF-7 cells. The expression of genes involved in the signaling pathways associated with proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis was significantly altered which cooperatively resulted into reduced growth promoting activities of breast cancer cells. Interestingly, artemisinin exhibited inhibitory effect on histone deacetylases (HDACs). Conclusions: Upregulated expression of tumor suppressor genes along with reduced expression of oncogenes significantly associated with growth stimulating signaling pathways in response to artemisinin treatment suggests its efficacy as an effective drug in breast cancer treatment. © 2017 The Author(s).","Breast cancer; HDACs; Invasion; Migration; Proliferation",Article,Scopus

Attitudes toward and experience with RGCT were assessed in 265 patients (at diagnosis, 6- and 12-month follow-up) and 29 medical professionals (before and after the recruitment period). Results: At 6-month follow-up, more patients who had been offered RGCT felt they had been actively involved in treatment decision-making than patients who had been offered usual care (67% vs 48%, P = 0.06). Patients who received DNA-test results before primary surgery reported more often that RGCT influenced treatment decisions than those who received results afterwards (P < 0.01). Eighty-seven percent felt that genetic counseling and testing (GCT) should preferably take place between diagnosis and surgery. Most professionals (72%) agreed that RGCT should be routinely offered to eligible patients. Most patients (74%) and professionals (85%) considered surgeons the most appropriate source for referral. Conclusions: RGCT is viewed as helpful for newly diagnosed high-risk BC patients in choosing their primary surgery and should be offered routinely by surgeons. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","BRCA1; BRCA2; breast cancer; genetic counseling and testing; patient empowerment",Article,Scopus

Using the example of meat consumption and colorectal cancer, we investigated whether results of epidemiologic studies are reported in an understandable and correct manner in German newspapers and magazines. Methods We gathered all articles published in 13 selected German newspapers and magazines that referred to a press release on meat consumption and colorectal cancer issued by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) on October 26th 2015. We analyzed these articles with regard to comprehensibility and correctness, and assessed the criteria used by the newspapers and magazines to judge the credibility of the research results. Results In the IARC press release, relative risks were used (“The experts concluded that each 50 gram portion of processed meat eaten daily increases the risk of colorectal cancer by 18%”), which 11 of 13 print media adopted. However, this wording may be misinterpreted by many readers as an increase of 18 percentage points, indicating that absolute risks should be preferred to relative risks in the newspapers and magazines. Only 6 print media reported absolute risks. 5 print media misleadingly reported thresholds for safe meat consumption. Other mistakes were vague descriptions of the index group (e.g. “excessive meat consumption” without specifying the exact amount (g/day)) and the reference group, and lack of time periods for which risks were estimated. To judge the credibility of the research on meat consumption and cancer risk, criteria for the quality of epidemiologic studies such as confounding and precision in the assessment of meat consumption were hardly taken into account. Conclusion Scientific institutions should attach more importance to an understandable presentation of measures of occurrence, measures of effects and important sources of bias in press releases. In the case of meat consumption and colorectal cancer, a higher quality of the press release by the IARC – in particular, reporting absolute instead of relative risks – would probably have led to less misleading publications in the print media.

Methods: The appropriate HIPEC regimen previously determined in vitro was 5-FU (200 µg/mL), MMC (2 µg/mL), and CDDP (10 µg/mL) at hyperthermic conditions (42°C) for 30 min. This was a clinical study to determine the recommended dose of 5-FU in combination with MMC and CDDP at 42°C for 30 min and to evaluate HIPEC safety in patients at high risk of developing peritoneal metastases following GC surgery. Results: Twelve patients were treated with surgery plus HIPEC using 5-FU at 0, 500, 750, and 1000 mg combined with MMC (10 mg) and CDDP (50 mg) in the perfusate (5 L). Dose-limiting toxicities did not develop until 1000 mg 5-FU was reached. Four patients experienced grade 1 or 2 adverse events. The recommended dose was 1000 mg 5-FU/5 L perfusate. Eight (66.7%) patients demonstrated no recurrence of peritoneal metastases; 5-year overall survival rate was 83.3%.

The target mRNA is selectively isolated by magnetic separation and adsorbed directly onto an unmodified SPE-Au. The surface-attached mRNA is then measured by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in the presence of [Fe(CN)6]4-/3- redox system.

Using an unsupervised learning approach, mixture-model based single cell analyses (MiMoSA) were proposed to infer single-cell subpopulations induced after drug treatment. In this method, a threshold was used to select genes among those that exhibited the highest variance with the assumption that the expression variability was introduced by the drug. In this work, through an expanded range of the thresholds, we study the effects of the varying feature space on the original clustering pattern identified by MiMoSA, and then observe if the set genes with the most differential expression were different. In the particular case of using single-cells treated with anti-diabetic drug metformin, our results demonstrate the robustness of MiMoSA wherein neither the default clustering pattern of cells post drug treatment nor the set of originally identified differentially expressed genes changed. This result demonstrates the ability of MiMoSA to reliably identify the most differentially expressed genes which indeed have shown to establish anti-cancer mechanisms of metformin in triple-negative breast cancer, for which there are still no targeted therapeutics. © 2017 IEEE.","breast cancer; metformin; model-based unsupervised learning; Single-cell RNA sequencing",Conference Paper,Scopus

This study evaluated the potential for fusion-derived CASQs to be a source of tumor neoepitopes, and determined their relationship to patterns of immune signatures in prostate cancer patients. Experimental Design: A computational strategy was used to identify CASQs and their corresponding predicted MHC class I epitopes using RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas of prostate tumors. In vitro peptide-specific T-cell expansion was performed to identify CASQ-reactive T cells. A multivariate analysis was used to relate patterns of in silico-predicted tumor-infiltrating immune cells with prostate tumors harboring these mutational events. Results: Eighty-seven percent of tumors contained gene fusions with a mean of 12 per tumor. In total, 41% of fusion-positive tumors were found to encode CASQs. Within these tumors, 87% gave rise to predicted MHC class I-binding epitopes. This observation was more prominent when patients were stratified into low- and intermediate/high-risk categories. One of the identified CASQ from the recurrent TMPRSS2: ERG type VI fusion contained several high-affinity HLA-restricted epitopes. These peptides bound HLA-A∗02: 01 in vitro and were recognized by CD8+ T cells. Finally, the presence of fusions and CASQs were associated with expression of immune cell infiltration. Conclusions: Mutanome analysis of gene fusion-derived CASQs can give rise to patient-specific predicted neoepitopes. Moreover, these fusions predicted patterns of immune cell infiltration within a subgroup of prostate cancer patients. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",,Article,Scopus

Folate analysis on the 99 paired human CRC tissues localized LFMS to the deep invasive T3/T4 staged tumours with hypo-methylated sonic hedgehog (Shh) promoter region and amplified expressions of Shh ligand and Gli1 effector, which coincided with deregulated expressions of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) mediators. Colonic folate levels of CRC were inversely correlated with pluripotent expressions of the SOX2, NANOG and OCT4 markers (p < 0.05). Exposure of human colon adenocarcinoma cells to LFMS microenvironment significantly hypomethylated Shh promoter region, activated Shh signaling, induced transcript and protein expressions of the pluripotent markers, promoted trans-differentiation as EMT by deregulation of Snail mediator and epithelial marker E-cadherin, increased MMP2/MMP9 enzymatic digestion on matrix protein for invasion, and promoted self-renewal capability of anchorage-independent tumor-spheroid formation. LFMS-induced cancer stem cell (CSC) signature and CRC invasion is synergized with inhibition of DNA methylation by 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine (5AZA) in rewiring EMT genotypes, which can be blockade by the Shh inhibitor (cyclopamine). The in vivo and in vitro data corroboratively identify CSC-like molecular targets specific to the LFMS-predisposed invasive CRC through reprogramming DNA methylation-activated Shh signaling. The study highlights CSC targets specific to LFMS-predisposed invasive CRC in optimizing folate co-chemotherapy to minimize tumour metastasis potential of CRC patients. © 2017 UICC","cancer stem cell; colorectal cancer invasion; DNA methylation; low folate metabolic stress; sonic hedgehog signal",Article,Scopus

In 1957, it was discovered that Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has oncolytic properties on tumor cells. To study the oncolytic properties of NDV in pancreatic cancer a single dose was administered intravenously in a syngeneic orthotopic tumor model using two different murine pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines (DT6606PDA, Panc02). Tumor growth was monitored and immune response was analyzed. A single treatment with NDV inhibited DT6606PDA tumor growth in mice and prevented recurrence for a period of three months. Tumor infiltration and systemic activation of NK cells, cytotoxic and helper T-cells was enhanced. NDV-induced melting of Panc02 tumors until d7 pi, but they recurred displaying unrestricted tumor growth, low immunogenicity and inhibition of tumor-specific immune response. Arrest of DT6606PDA tumor growth and rejection was mediated by activation of NK cells and a specific antitumor immune response via T-cells. Panc02 tumors rapidly decreased until d7 pi, but henceforth tumors characterized by the ability to perform immune-regulatory functions reappeared. Our results demonstrated that NDV-activated immune cells are able to reject tumors provided that an adaptive antitumor immune response can be initiated. However, activated NK cells that are abundant in Panc02 tumors lead to outgrowth of nonimmunogenic tumor cells with inhibitory properties. Our study emphasizes the importance of an adaptive immune response, which is initiated by NDV to mediate long-term tumor surveillance in addition to direct oncolysis. © 2017 UICC","anti-tumor immunity; Newcastle Disease Virus; orthotopic tumor model; virotherapy",Article,Scopus

Its dysregulation is associated with a vast number of tumors such as non-small-cell lung cancer, colon cancer, head-and-neck cancer, breast and ovarian cancer. Being implicated in the development of a number of the most lethal cancers worldwide, EGFR has long been considered as a focal target for cancer therapies, ever since the FDA approval of “Gefitinib” in 2003 and up to the last FDA approved small molecule EGFR kinase inhibitor “Osimertinib” in 2015. Studies are still going on to find more efficient EGFR inhibitors due to the continuous emergence of resistance to the current inhibitors. Cancerous cells resist EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) through various mechanisms, the most commonly reported ones are the T790M mutation and HER2 amplification. Therefore, tackling EGFR TKIs-resistant tumors through a multi-targeting approach comprising a dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor that is also capable of inhibiting the mutant T790M EGFR is anticipated to overcome drug resistance. In this review, we will survey the structural aspects of EGFR family and the structure-activity relationship of representative dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitors. To follow, we will discuss the structural aspects of the mutation-driven resistance and various design strategies to overcome it. Finally, we will review the SAR of exemplary irreversible dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitors that can overcome the mutation-driven resistance. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS","Dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitors; Irreversible inhibitors; Resistance; T790M/L858R mutant EGFR",Review,Scopus

Cancer is a set of diseases where multiple mutations in a signaling pathway lead to uncontrolled proliferation. These mutations may arise from spontaneous or induced mechanisms and are often fixed into the genome by situations where proliferation is driven to completion before normal repair systems can remove the mutation. This forced proliferation leads to additional mutations, some of which can lead to abnormal changes in cell surface proteins. These can be recognized by the immune system as not-self and can lead to activation of the immune system. Some would-be tumors are eliminated by the immune system but in some cases the tumor develops ways to inhibit or avoid the immune system. We will discuss a brief overview of the current knowledge about the biology of cancer. This will be followed by a short- and high-level review of the immune system with emphasis on those components more directly involved in antitumor defense.

Methods: Thirty-five patients (27 males, 8 females; mean age 63 ± 8.6 years) were operated between 1994 and 2015 in four European Centers. Histology: 12 (34.3%) squamous cell carcinoma, and 6 (17.1%) undifferentiated/large cell carcinoma. The site of aortic infiltration was the descending thoracic aorta in 24 (68.6%) patients, the aortic arch in 9 (25.7%), and the aortic arch and supraortic trunks in 2 (5.7%). Results: Lung resection consisted of pneumonectomy in 19 (54.3%) patients and lobectomy in 16 (45.7%). Aortic resection management was undertaken by endograft positioning (37.1%), subadventitial dissection (37.1%), cardiopulmonary/aorto-aortic bypass (17.2%), and direct clamping (8.6%). A tubular graft replacement was carried out in five cases, a synthetic patch repair in 6. Mortality was 2.9%, morbidity 37.1%. Patients undergoing pneumonectomy had a significantly higher morbidity rate compared with lobectomy (52% vs 18.7%; P = 0.003), although patients managed with aortic endografting had a lower complication rate.

This work aims at studying the molecular biology of both primary and recurrent HGSOC. Experimental Design: Gene expression profiles of matched primary and recurrent fresh-frozen tumor tissues from 66HGSOC patients were obtained by RNA sequencing. Clustering analyses and pairwise comparison of the profiles between matched samples and subsequent functional alignment were used for the identification of molecular characteristics of HGSOC. Results: Both primary and recurrent HGSOC samples presented predominant gene expression differences in their microenvironment, determined by a panel of genes covering all major pathways of immune activation together with a number of genes involved in the remodeling of extracellular matrix and adipose tissues. Stratifying tumor tissues into immune active and silent groups, we further discovered that although some recurrent tumors shared the same immune status as their primary counterparts, others switched the immune status, either from silent to active or active to silent. Interestingly, genes belonging to the B7-CD28 immune checkpoint family, known for their major role as negative regulators of the immune response, were overexpressed in the immune active tumors. Searching for potential tumor antigens, CEACAM21, a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen family, was found to be significantly overexpressed in immune active tissues in comparison with the silent ones.

DOX is one of the representative cancer chemotherapy agents and is widely used by many researchers as a chemotherapy agent in the drug delivery system. Due to the advantages of AuNPs such as simple steps in synthesis, high surface-area-to-volume ratio, and biocompatibility, we utilized AuNPs as drug delivery vehicle. AuNPs were synthesized by chemical reduction to be 13 nm diameter. The G-C rich oligonucleotides were used both for drug loading sites and AuNPs capping agents. 80% of DOX in solution could be bound to ONTs on AuNPs to became DOX-loaded AuNPs coated with ONTs (Doxorubicin-Oligomer-AuNP, DOA), and about 28% of loaded DOX was released from the as-prepared DOA. Confocal microscopy observation showed that DOA was well transported into cells, and finally the DOX was released into the cell nucleus. The drug's efficacies such as in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo tumor growth inhibition were demonstrated with SW480 colon cancer cell line and a xenograft mouse model. MTT assay was performed to see the cytotoxicity effect on SW480 cells treated with DOA for 24 h, and the cell viability was determined to be 41.77% (p < 0.001). When DOA was administered regularly to a tumor bearing mouse, the tumor growth inhibition degree was examined by measuring the tumor size. The treatment-control (T/C) ratio was found to be 0.69. Thus, our results suggest the use of DOAs as promising drug delivery systems for colorectal cancer therapy. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS","Colorectal cancer; Doxorubicin; Drug delivery; Gold nanoparticle; Nanomedicine",Article,Scopus

Historical cohorts may be small and potentially biased; to the authors' knowledge, disease recurrence studies from international registries are outdated. Using a large recent cohort of patients with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma from Children's Oncology Group (COG) modern-era early-phase trials, the authors determined outcome and quantified parameters for designing future studies. METHODS: The first early-phase COG trial enrollment (sequential) of 383 distinct patients with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma on 23 phase 1, 3 phase 1/2, and 9 phase 2 trials (August 2002 to January 2014) was analyzed for progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and time to disease progression (TTP). Planned frontline therapy for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma included hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (approximately two-thirds of patients underwent ≥1 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation); 13.2% of patients received dinutuximab. RESULTS: From the time of the patient's first early-phase trial enrollment (383 patients), the 1-year and 4-year PFS rates (± standard error) were 21% ± 2% and 6% ± 1%, respectively, whereas the 1-year and 4-year OS rates were 57% ± 3% and 20% ± 2%, respectively. The median TTP was 58 days (interquartile range, 31-183 days [350 patients]); the median follow-up was 25.3 months (33 patients were found to be without disease recurrence/progression). The median time from diagnosis to first disease recurrence/progression was 18.7 months (range, 1.4-64.8 months) (176 patients). MYCN amplification and 11q loss of heterozygosity were prognostic of worse PFS and OS (P =.003 and P<.0001, respectively, and P =.02 and P =.03, respectively) after early-phase trial enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: This recent COG cohort of patients with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma is inclusive and representative. To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the first meta-analysis of PFS, TTP, and OS within the context of modern therapy. These results will inform the design of future phase 2 studies by providing a) historical context during the search for more effective agents; and, b) factors prognostic of PFS and OS after disease recurrence to stratify randomization.

We present and compare the performance of the different approaches of features (genes) subset selection methods based on Wrapper and Markov Blanket models for the five-microarray cancer datasets. The first alternative depends on Memetic algorithms (MAs) for feature selection method. In the second alternative, we use MRMR (Minimum Redundant Maximum Relevant) for feature subset selection method hybridized by genetic search optimization techniques.

Obesity is a factor complicating use and outcomes of laparoscopic technique for rectal surgery. Impact of obesity on the outcomes of robotic rectal surgery for cancer is not well defined. This study is designed to assess whether if the robotic technique has potential to overcome the limitations of obesity and to improve outcomes of minimally invasive rectal surgery for cancer. Patients and Methods: Patients undergoing robotic sphincter-saving radical resection with da Vinci Xi System between December 2014 and December 2016 were included. Patients were divided into 2 groups as obese and nonobese. Patient demographics, perioperative outcomes and short-term results were compared between the groups. Results: The study included 101 patients (30 were obese). Sex (female: 35 vs. 37%, P=0.89), American Society of Anesthesiologists score (2 vs. 2, P=0.41), number of patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation (39% vs. 23%, P=0.12) and history of prior abdominal surgery (28% vs. 23%, P=0.62) were comparable between the groups. Operative time was longer in the obese group (311 vs. 332 min. P=0.01). Overall complication rates (27% vs. 23%, P=0.72), length of hospital stay (6 vs. 7, P=0.10) and pathologic outcomes were similar between the groups. Conversion to laparoscopy was not required in any operation. Two nonobese patients required conversion to open surgery. Conclusion: Robotic rectal surgery for cancer in obese patients is equally safe and effective as in nonobese patients.

In cancer cells, PP2A function can be compromised by several mechanisms, including sporadic mutations in its scaffolding A and regulatory B subunits or more frequently through overexpression of cellular PP2A inhibitors. Here, we identify a novel genetic mechanism by which PP2A function is recurrently affected in human cancer, involving haploinsufficiency of PPP2R4, a gene encoding the cellular PP2A activator PTPA. Notably, up to 70% of cancer patients showed a heterozygous deletion or missense mutations in PPP2R4. Cancer-associated PTPA mutants exhibited decreased abilities to bind the PP2A-C subunit or activate PP2A and failed to reverse the tumorigenic phenotype induced by PTPA suppression, indicating they function as null alleles. In Ppp2r4 gene-trapped (gt) mice showing residual PTPA expression, total PP2A activity and methylation were reduced, selectively affecting specific PP2A holoenzymes. Both PTPAgt/gt and PTPA+/gt mice showed higher rates of spontaneous tumors, mainly hematologic malignancies and hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. These tumors exhibited increased c-Myc phosphorylation and increased Wnt or Hedgehog signaling. We observed a significant reduction in lifespan in PTPA+/gt mice compared with wild-type mice. In addition, chemical-induced skin carcinogenesis was accelerated in PTPA+/gt compared with wild-type mice.

Among of the most investigated PTs regarding their anticancer properties are oleanane-, ursane and friedelane-types, including oleanolic, glycyrrhetinic, ursolic and asiatic acids, and celastrol, among others. The extensive research in this field shows that the anticancer effects of PTs are mediated by several mechanisms, as they modulate a diverse range of molecular targets and signaling pathways, involved in cancer cell proliferation and survival. Considering the anticancer potential of this class of compounds, a number of semisynthetic derivatives has been synthetized aiming to improve their therapeutic activity and pharmacokinetic properties, and decrease their toxicity. Some of these new semisynthetic derivatives have shown improved anticancer activity in various cancer cell lines and animal models compared with the parent compound. Moreover, some of these compounds have been assessed in clinical trials, proving to be safe for human use. This review updates the most recent findings on the semisynthetic derivatives of oleanane-, ursane- and quinone methide friedelane-type PTs with anticancer activity. A brief introduction concerning the PTs and their anticancer activity is given, and the main semisynthetic modifications that have been performed between 2012 and early 2017 are reviewed and discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS","Cancer; Pentacyclic triterpenoids; Semisynthetic derivatives; Structure-activity relationship",Review,Scopus

Here, we provide evidence of a critical role for STK33 in the pathogenesis and metastatic progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). STK33 expression in PDAC was regulated by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF1a. In human PDAC specimens, STK33 was overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. Enforced STK33 expression promoted PDAC proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor growth, whereas STK33 depletion exerted opposing effects. Mechanistic investigations showed that HIF1a regulated STK33 via direct binding to a hypoxia response element in its promoter. In showing that dysregulated HIF1a/STK33 signaling promotes PDAC growth and progression, our results suggest STK33 as a candidate therapeutic target to improve PDAC treatment. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",,Article,Scopus

In this study, we show that the protein palmitoyltransferase DHHC3 is upregulated in malignant and metastatic human breast cancer. Elevated expression of DHHC3 correlated with diminished patient survival in breast cancer and six other human cancer types. ZDHHC3 ablation in human MDA-MB-231 mammary tumor cell xenografts reduced the sizes of both the primary tumor and metastatic lung colonies. Gene array data and fluorescence dye assays documented increased oxidative stress and senescence in ZDHHC3-ablated cells. ZDHHC3-ablated tumors also showed enhanced recruitment of innate immune cells (antitumor macrophages, natural killer cells) associated with clearance of senescent tumors. These antitumor effects were reversed upon reconstitution with wild-type, but not enzyme-active site-deficient DHHC3. Concomitant ablation of the upregulated oxidative stress protein TXNIP substantially negated the effects of ZDHHC3 depletion on oxidative stress and senescence. Diminished DHHC3-dependent palmitoylation of ERGIC3 protein likely played a key role in TXNIP upregulation. In conclusion, DHHC3-mediated protein palmitoylation supports breast tumor growth by modulating cellular oxidative stress and senescence. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",,Article,Scopus

Emerging evidence demonstrates the important role of autophagy in cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy. Therefore, autophagy inhibition by natural compounds may be a promising strategy for overcoming drug resistance in liver cancer cells. Here, we found that ADCX, a natural cycloartane triterpenoid extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) source Cimicifugae rhizoma (Shengma), impaired autophagic degradation by suppressing lysosomal cathepsin B (CTSB) expression in multidrug-resistant liver cancer HepG2/ADM cells, thereby leading to autophagic flux inhibition. Moreover, impairing autophagic flux promoted ADCX-induced apoptotic cell death in HepG2/ADM cells. Interestingly, Akt was overactivated by ADCX treatment, which downregulated CTSB and inhibited autophagic flux. Together, our results provide the first demonstration that an active TCM constituent can overcome multidrug resistance in liver cancer cells via Akt-mediated inhibition of autophagic degradation. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Akt; Autophagic degradation; Autophagic flux; Cathepsin B; Cycloartane triterpenoid; Multidrug-resistant HCC",Article,Scopus

Methods: In total, 362 patients who had undergone surgical treatment of gallbladder adenocarcinoma at a tertiary institute were evaluated to establish two BN models using a tree-augmented naïve Bayes algorithm. We then chose 250 patients with T3-4N0-2M0 stage gallbladder adenocarcinoma to test the posterior probability after the surgical type was taken into account. Results: In total, 170 patients (≤7 months) and 137 patients (>7 months) were correctly classified in the median survival time model (accuracy, 84.81%), and 204 patients (≤12 months), 15 patients (12-36 months), 17 patients (36-60 months), and 34 patients (>60 months) were correctly classified in the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival model (accuracy, 74.59%), respectively. Every posterior probability in the two models upregulated the ratio of the longer survival time and suggested a better prognosis for gallbladder adenocarcinoma that can be improved by R0 resection. Conclusions: These BN models indicate that stages T4 and N2 gallbladder adenocarcinoma are not contraindications for surgery and that R0 resection can improve survival in patients with advanced gallbladder adenocarcinoma. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Bayesian network model; gallbladder adenocarcinoma; predictive model; surgery; TNM stage",Article,Scopus

Two main contributions, material and methods, are presented. In terms of material, a new minimally invasive technology, combining fiber evanescent wave spectroscopy and newly patented biosensors, is used for the first time to acquire mid-infrared spectra from voided urine/bladder wash. This new machine promises practicality, cheapness and high-quality of spectrum acquisition. As for classical systems, the data acquired using the new system was highly correlated, resulting in a poor classification performance using classical methods. Therefore, the second contribution consists in developing statistical methods that alleviate the problem. Three new statistical methods based on Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis algorithm (PLSDA) are proposed. PLSDA is a supervised classifier well-known for its ability to process correlated data. The key point is the choice of the most discriminant latent variables in the training step. In this work, we propose three new decision rules in order to select the most relevant latent variables. These decision rules give rise to three algorithms, namely bayesian, joint and best model PLSDA. A comparative study between the proposed methods and standard ones, namely SVM, K-MEANS and classical PLSDA, confirms clearly the efficiency of the former. The best performance in terms of accuracy is achieved by joint and best model PLSDA (82.35%). Besides, by embedding the proposed statistical methods in the new machine, we are able to provide a new medical device that is very promising in terms of automatic bladder cancer detection. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Automatic detection; Bladder cancer; Chalcogenide glass fibers; Infrared spectroscopy; PLSDA; SVM; Variable selection",Article,Scopus

Methods: This multicenter retrospective cohort study enrolled 328 consecutive patients who underwent LAR for rectal cancer at participating hospitals from 2009 to 2014. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for confounding factors. Results: A transanal tube was placed in 205 patients (TA group) and not placed in 123 patients (non-TA group). Symptomatic AL occurred in 36 cases (11%), with significantly higher incidence of symptomatic AL in the non-TA group than in the TA group (15% vs 8.3%, odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-4.06). After adjusting for confounding factors, multivariate analysis revealed that placement of a transanal tube could decrease the incidence of symptomatic AL (adjusted OR 0.37, 95%CI 0.15-0.91). There was no significant difference in postoperative morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, or local recurrence rate between the two groups. Local recurrence rate tended to be higher in patients with symptomatic AL (3/36) than in those without it (10/292).

Our ability to dissect oncogenic events is largely dependent on the availability of model systems that recapitulate human carcinogenesis at both the pathological and molecular levels. With progress in molecular and cell biology, studies with cell model systems have produced many important conceptual advances for our understanding of the mechanism of carcinogenesis. In parallel, animal models provide the tissue and the systemic contexts of carcinogenesis and serve to validate molecular predictions and targeting opportunities in cancer prevention and treatment. With the development of genetically engineered mouse models, the functional consequences and tissue dynamics of genetic alterations can be defined at discrete stages of carcinogenesis. The cooperative models that bridge cell culture techniques and corresponding animal models offer simple and quantitative approaches to evaluate the oncogenic potential of carcinogens (chemical, viral, and physical agents), immunity, as well as the roles of discrete candidate cancer genes in carcinogenesis. The choice of a model is of importance and should take into account the cell/tissue type of origin, the complexity of carcinogenesis, the variety of carcinogen and therapeutic reagents to be tested, and the relevance to human cancer. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Animal model; Carcinogenesis; Cell model; Epithelial transformation; Hallmarks of cancer; Hepatocarcinogenesis; Initiation; Malignant conversion; Oncogenic pathways; P53; RAS; Squamous cell carcinoma; Tumor progression; Tumor promotion; Tumorigenesis; Two-stage carcinogenesis",Book Chapter,Scopus

Given that acetaldehyde associated with alcohol consumption is assessed as a carcinogen, consideration of differences in acetaldehyde exposure would aid accuracy in assessing the bladder cancer risk associated with alcohol consumption. Here, we conducted a population-based cohort study in Japan to examine this association, including information on the flushing response as a surrogate marker of the capacity of acetaldehyde metabolism. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. During follow up from 1990 through 2012 for the 95,915 subjects (45,649 men and 50,266 women, aged 40–69 years), 354 men and 110 women were newly diagnosed with bladder cancer. No significant association between alcohol consumption and bladder cancer risk was observed in the overall analysis. Among male flushers, HRs were 1.04 (95% CI 0.70–1.54), 1.67 (1.16–2.42), 1.02 (0.62–1.67) and 0.63 (0.33–1.20) for alcohol consumption of 1–150, 151–300, 301–450, >450 g/week of pure ethanol compared with non-drinkers and occasional drinkers, respectively, indicating an inverted U-shaped association between alcohol consumption and bladder cancer risk.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 81 surgically treated, early breast cancer patients during the period from 08-2015 to 05-2017. All the cases have been analysed by standard histological analysis including macroscopic and microscopic examination by routine H&E staining. For determination of molecular receptors, immunostaining by PT LINK immunoperoxidase has been done for HER2neu, ER, PR, p53 and Ki67. RESULTS: Patients age ranged between 31-73 years, an average of 56.86 years. The mean size of a primary tumour in the surgically treated patient was 20.33 ± 6.0 mm. Axillary dissection revealed from 5 to 32 lymph nodes, with an average of 14. Metastases have been found in 1 to 7 lymph nodes, with an average 0.7. Only 26 (32.1%) of the patients showed metastases in the axillary lymph nodes. The univariant regression analysis showed that the size of a tumour and presence of HER2neu receptors on cancer cells influence the positivity of the axillary lymph nodes. The presence of the estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors have no influence on the positivity for metastatic deposits of lymph nodes. Multivariant model and logistic regression analysis as significant independent factors or predictors of positivity of the axillary lymph nodes are influenced by the tumour size only. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the metastatic involvement of the axillary lymph nodes is mainly influenced by the size of a tumour and presence of HER2neu receptors in the univariant analysis. This point to the important influence of positivity of the axillary lymph nodes but, in multi-variant regressive analysis the lymph node status correlates with the tumour size only. © 2017 Borislav Kondov, Rosalinda Isijanovska, Zvonko Milenkovikj, Gordana Petrusevska, Marija Jovanovski-Srceva, Magdalena Bogdanovska-Todorovska, Goran Kondov.","Early breast cancer; Factors that predict axillary status; Ki67; Lymphovascular invasion; Tumour size",Article,Scopus

A Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing NOZ cells (2000 cell well−1) and 1 (0–100 nM) was introduced into a 96-well microplate and incubated for 24 h to accumulate 1 into the NOZ cells and to multiply the NOZ cells until the cell number reached 104 cells well−1. After replacing the DMEM medium containing 1 with a fresh DMEM medium without 1, the plates were irradiated for 30 min at 610 nm. After incubation was performed for 24 h in dark conditions, the cell viability of the NOZ cells was determined using the MTT assay. The half maximum inhibitory concentrations 50 (IC50) of 1a–1d were found to be in the range of 33.7–58.7 nM for NOZ. These IC50 values for the NOZ were one hundredth the IC50 value (7.57 μM) for mono-L-aspartyl chlorin e6 (laserphyrin®). Thus, it was found that the PDT activity of 1a–1d was much higher than the mono-L-aspartyl chlorin e6. Similarly, IC50 vales of 1a–1d for HeLa cells were found to be 27.8–52.5 nM. This showed that 1a–1d had high photodynamic activity in cancer cells.

The overall response rate (ORR), grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse event rate, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) were extracted from the most recently published studies to determine the relative risk (RR), hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Seven randomized controlled trials and one open-label study were identified (n = 3,097). Treatments included combinations of several ICIs, a combination of an ICI and dacarbazine, two combinations of an ICI, paclitaxel and carboplatin, and a combination of an ICI and gp100 vaccine. Higher ORR (RR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.03–2.20, p = 0.034), OS (HR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.78–0.95, p = 0.000), and PFS (HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.72–1.14, p = 0.000) values were observed in combination therapy than in monotherapy. In addition, the toxicity of combination ICI immunotherapy was higher (RR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.03–2.19, p = 0.036) than that of monotherapy. This meta-analysis showed that the addition of nivolumab to ipilimumab better benefits PFS and ORR. Adding sargramostim was associated with better OS and safety.

Recent works have demonstrated that lncRNAs are often dysregulated in HCC, and the dysregulation of some of these lncRNAs are associated with the clinicopathological features of HCC. They regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), invasion and metastasis of HCC by modulating gene expression and cancer-related signaling pathways, and thus contribute to the onset and progression of HCC.

The cytotoxicity of CACaP/siRNA NPs and the cell uptake of siRNA in A549 cells were detected by MTT assay and flow cytometer, respectively. Moreover, the expression of EGFR mRNA and protein in A549 cells was detected by RT-PCR and Western-blot, respectively. Results: CACaP/siRNA nanoparticles modified by the alendronate-β-cyclodextrin were stable and uniform (200 nm and -14 mV), which had good stability and serum protection and could maintain more than 90% of the cell viability in A549 cells.

The immune function of the skin is an excellent example. Within the skin are all the components needed to initiate the immune response. Moreover, environmental agents that interact with the skin can induce regulatory processes that affect distant immune reactions. A prominent example is the ultraviolet (UV) radiation present in sunlight. UV radiation is a complete carcinogen and the primary cause of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer, the most prevalent types of cancer found in the industrialized world.

Methods: The overall (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) prognostic discriminatory ability of various commonly used models were assessed in a large retrospective cohort. Harrell's concordance index (c-index) was used to determine accuracy of model prediction. Results: Among 1054 ICC patients, median OS was 37.7 months and 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival, were 78.8%, 51.5%, and 39.3%, respectively. Recurrence of disease occurred in 454 (43.0%) patients with a median DFS of 29.6 months. One-, 3- and 5- year DFS were 64.6%, 46.5 % and 44.4%, respectively. The prognostic models associated with the best OS prediction were the Wang nomogram (c-index 0.668) and the Nathan staging system (c-index 0.639). No model was proficient in predicting DFS. Only the Wang nomogram exceeded a c-index of 0.6 for DFS (c-index 0.602). The c-index for the AJCC staging system was 0.637 for OS and 0.582 for DFS. Conclusions: While the Wang nomogram had the best discriminatory ability relative to OS and DFS, no ICC staging system or nomogram demonstrated excellent prognostic discrimination. The AJCC staging for ICC performed reasonably, although its overall discrimination was only modest-to-good. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; prognostic staging; recurrence; risk factors; survival",Article,Scopus

Our objective was to evaluate the incidence rate and cumulative probability of having a potentially inadequate CC (PI-CC, e.g. a CC that was performed earlier that recommended) and the association between the report of a hyperplastic polyp in the baseline CC report and the probability of having a PI-CC. Methods: A retrospective cohort of adults 50y/o or older with a complete baseline CC between January 1st and December 31st 2005, without reported lesions or with hyperplastic polyps, based on secondary data extracted from the electronic medical record of the Hospital Italiano of Buenos Aires. The outcome consisted of time until a PI-CC, defined as the time measured between basal colonoscopy and a colonoscopy performed earlier than the inter-screening interval recommended by the USPSTF and the USMSTF. Results: 389 patients were included. The cumulative probability of receiving a PI-CC over 10 years was 0.29 (95% CI 0.241, 0.342). The incidence rate resulted in 30.91 PI-CC per 1000 person-years (95% CI 25.14, 38). The crude analysis of the association between the outcome and the presence of hyperplastic polyps in the baseline CC, showed a statistically significant difference between both groups (log rank, p 0.036). The multivariate analysis yielded a hazard ratio of 1.67 (95% CI 1.02-2.73). Conclusion: We observed that 3 in every 10 patients treated in our health system received a PI-CC during the first ten consecutive years after a normal complete CC. Furthermore, this could be in part attributed to the presence of a hyperplastic polyp in the baseline CC. © 2017 The Author(s).","Colonoscopy; Colorectal cancer; Over screening",Article,Scopus

The protein is a strong transcriptional repressor capable of downregulating numerous genes. There are three splicing isoforms of JARID1B, however the links between the protein structure and function are not clear. The expression pattern of JARID1B in human melanoma seems to be different from observed in other cancers. Moreover, up to now no data on the impact of JARID1B expression in cutaneous melanoma on the patients' prognosis have been reported. Methods: We investigated immunohistochemically the association of intratumoral expression of total JARID1B protein and its RBP2-H1 isoform in primary and metastatic melanomas with prognosis for the patients. Results: Expression of both total JARID1B protein and its RBP2-H1 variant was found in all the melanomas investigated. Our results indicate, however, that only high (above 90% of the cells) intratumoral expression of RBP2-H1 can be considered prognostic factor associated with worse overall survival of the patients. Conclusions: Such results if considered together with data demonstrating a switch to enhanced expression of RBP2-H1 at early stages of malignant transformation of melanocytes are in agreement with hypothetical crucial role of JARID1B in the course of melanoma development and progression and suggest that altered splicing of JARID1B may be important factor increasing melanoma aggressiveness. © 2017 The Author(s).","Immunohistochemistry; JARID1B; Melanoma; Patient's survival; RBP2-H1 variant of JARID1B",Article,Scopus

Although great attention has been paid to the diagnosis of and therapy for OS, the 5-year survival rate of patients with this disease remains poor. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs involved in pathogenesis and progression of human malignancies. MiR-139 has been implicated in several human cancers. However, the role played by miR-139 in pathogenesis of human OS has remained largely unknown. Main methods Realtime PCR was used to detect the expression of miR-139. CCK-8, BrdU-ELISA and ApoTox-Glo™ Triplex assay was employed to detect the proliferation and apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells. Realtime PCR, Western Blotting and luciferase report assays were conducted for the target genes analysis. Key findings The expression of miR-139 was reduced while the expression of forkhead-box P2 (FOXP2) was induced in both OS tissue and cell lines. The reduced level of miR-139 was correlated with tumor size, clinical stage and distant metastasis. Overexpression of miR-139 inhibited the expression of FOXP2, which suppressed cell growth, but induced apoptosis. Further, we confirmed that FOXP2 was a direct target of miR-139 by luciferase reporter assay. Knockdown of FOXP2 resulted in reduced levels of cell proliferation, but increased levels of apoptosis in vitro. Significance These findings suggest that miR-139 plays a suppressive role in the regulation of OS cell proliferation and migration via directly targeting FOXP2, which might be a potential clinical diagnostic or predictive biomarker for human OS. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Apoptosis; FOXP2; miR-139; Osteosarcoma; Proliferation",Article,Scopus

This condition often involves ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that, by pumping the drugs outside from cancer cells, attenuate the potency of chemotherapeutics and negatively impact on the fate of anticancer therapy. In recent years, several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (e.g., imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, ponatinib, gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, vandetanib, sunitinib, sorafenib) have been reported to interact with ABC transporters (e.g., ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCG2, ABCC10). This finding disclosed a very complex scenario in which TKIs may behave as substrates or inhibitors depending on the expression of specific pumps, drug concentration, affinity for transporters and types of co-administered agents. In this context, in-depth investigation on TKI chemosensitizing functions might provide a strong rationale for combining TKIs and conventional therapeutics in specific malignancies. The reposition of TKIs as antagonists of ABC transporters opens a new way towards anticancer therapy and clinical strategies aimed at counteracting drug resistance. This review will focus on some paradigmatic examples of the complex and not yet fully elucidated interaction between clinical available TKIs (e.g. BCR-ABL, EGFR, VEGFR inhibitors) with the main ABC transporters implicated in multidrug resistance. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS","BCR-ABL inhibitors; Drug combinations; EGFR inhibitors; MDR; VEGFR inhibitors",Short Survey,Scopus

METHODS: The data of 191 patients with malignant neoplasia were analyzed. All photos of patients' tongue image were recorded and lingual flange protrusion was the positive standard. χ2 test for paired data and Kappa test were used to determine the diagnostic value of lingual flange protrusion for metastatic liver cancer. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the levels of liver serological markers. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and logistic regression model were used to analyze the predictive values of lingual flange protrusion, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. RESULTS: Patients with lingual flange protrusion had a higher risk of liver metastasis than those without it (P &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in diagnosis of liver metastasis between lingual flange protrusion and traditional diagnostic criteria (P = 0.541). Kappa was 0.738 (P &lt; 0.001). Lingual flange protrusion was significantly correlated with increased serum ALP and LDH levels (P &lt; 0.01). Comparison of ROC curves showed that the diagnostic value of lingual flange protrusion is better than ALP, LDH and the combination of ALP and LDH (P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, the combined diagnostic values of lingual flange protrusion and ALP, lingual flange protrusion and LDH, and lingual flange protrusion, ALP and LDH are not better than lingual flange protrusion alone (P &gt; 0.05).

In an effort to overcome this suppressive mechanism, we evaluated NK cell responses to the immunostimulatory cytokine IL12. Exposure to IL12 rescued the cytotoxicity of NK cells but also led to the emergence of an immature NK cell population that expressed high levels of the coinhibitory molecules PD-1, Lag-3, and TIGIT, thereby limiting NK cell-mediated control of pulmonary metastases.

Here, we report a family of stilbene-like compounds called A11 that can inhibit melanoma growth in both melanoma-forming zebrafish embryos and mouse melanoma cells. The growth inhibition by A11 is a result of mitosis reduction but not apoptosis enhancement. Meanwhile, A11 activates both MAPK and Akt signaling pathways.

This indicates that PDE3A could serve both as a drug target and a biomarker of sensitivity to PDE3 inhibition. In this report, we explored publicly available mRNA gene expression data to identify cell lines with different PDE3A expression. Cell lines with high PDE3A expression showed marked in vitro sensitivity to PDE inhibitors zardaverine and quazinone, when compared with those having low PDE3A expression. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical stainings were in agreement with PDE3A mRNA expression, providing suitable alternatives for biomarker analysis of clinical tissue specimens. Moreover, we here demonstrate that tumor cells from patients with ovarian carcinoma show great variability in PDE3A protein expression and that level of PDE3A expression is correlated with sensitivity to PDE inhibition. Finally, we demonstrate that PDE3A is highly expressed in subsets of patient tumor cell samples from different solid cancer diagnoses and expressed at exceptional levels in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) specimens. Importantly, vulnerability to PDE3 inhibitors has recently been associated with co-expression of PDE3A and Schlafen family member 12 (SLFN12). We here demonstrate that high expression of PDE3A in clinical specimens, at least on the mRNA level, seems to be frequently associated with high SLFN12 expression.

Here, the cell cytotoxic effects of bergapten and xanthotoxin were analyzed alone and in combination with standard chemotherapeutics on three multidrug resistant cells and their nonresistant parental counterparts. The furanocoumarins modulatory effects on MDR1, BCRP, and MRP pump expression and function were investigated. Although quantitative real time PCR demonstrated that the MDR transcript level changes in a time dependent manner, flow cytometric analyses using fluorescent-labeled antibodies have indicated that bergapten and xanthotoxin had no significant effect on the protein levels. FACS analyses indicated that these prominent anticancer agents significantly blocked MDR1, BCRP, and MRP transporter function. Maximum furanocoumarin-mediated pump activity blockage in the MDR-resistant cells was quantified as 87% of normal and consequently, chemotherapeutic accumulation increased up to 2.7-fold and cytotoxicity tension increased 104-fold. MDR1 efflux kinetics also revealed that the maximum velocity and the pump affinity to daunorubicin were uncompetitively decreased.

Preclinical and clinical studies have revealed that ErbB family for example epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a validated molecular target for pancreatic cancer prevention and therapy. The ErbB signaling cascade is regulated by a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family, namely ADAM17, by enzymatic cleavage of precursor ligands into soluble cytokines and growth factors. Mouse genetic studies have demonstrated that ADAM17 is required for PDAC development. In this study, we evaluated the anti-tumor effects of A9(B8) IgG – the first specific ‘human and mouse cross-reactive’ ADAM17 inhibitory antibody on pancreatic malignant transformation. We found that inhibition of ADAM17 with A9(B8) IgG efficiently suppressed the shedding of ADAM17 substrates both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated that administration of A9(B8) IgG significantly suppressed motility in human pancreatic cancer cells and also significantly delayed tumorigenesis in the Pdx1Cre;KrasG12D;Trp53fl/+ PDAC mouse model. Inhibition of ADAM17 with A9(B8) IgG particularly affected the progression of pre-invasive pancreatic lesions to advanced PDAC in mice.

Medical approaches designed to harness the immune system are the focus of several recent promising therapeutic approaches for cancer patients. However, not all tumors appear to respond to these immunomodulatory schemes. A major challenge for cancer immunotherapy, therefore, lies in understanding resistance mechanisms for selecting patients who are most likely to benefit. Moreover, tumors may also escape elimination either by recruiting immunosuppressive leukocytes which orchestrate a microenvironment that spoils the productivity of an anti-tumor immune response or underexpose cell-surface molecules. Therefore, predicting the clinical benefit of T cell immunotherapy is likely to require an understanding of each of these steps and their combinations as it relates to a patient's individual tumor. Trial and errors approaches should be avoided in the clinical practice.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 368 patients with newly diagnosed HCC who underwent initial and potentially curative LR. Univariate and multivariate analyses using the Cox proportional hazard model were performed to detect clinical characteristics that correlated with overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test were used to compare OS and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: The result of multivariate analysis using 25 clinical characteristics selected by univariate analysis revealed that the GAR (≥0.918/&lt;0.918) was significantly associated with OS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.398; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.012-5.683; P = 0.047), as well as platelet count (&lt;14/≥14, ×10 4 /mm 3 ) and portal vein invasion (presence/absence).

Patients and Methods: Ninety-nine patients scheduled to nipple sparing mastectomy (NSM) underwent magnetic resonance (MR) examination at 1.5 T, including sagittal T2w and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MR imaging. An automatic method was developed to segment the NAC and the tumor and to compute the 3D distance between them. The automatic measurement was compared with manual axial and sagittal 2D measurements. NAC involvement was defined by the presence of invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma and/or ductal carcinoma in situ or ductal intraepithelial neoplasia (DIN1c − DIN3). Results: Tumor-NAC distance was computed on 95/99 patients (25 NAC+), as three tumors were not correctly segmented (sensitivity = 97%), and 1 NAC was not detected (sensitivity = 99%). The automatic 3D distance reached the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (0.830) with respect to the manual axial (0.676), sagittal (0.664), and minimum distances (0.664). At the best cut-off point of 21 mm, the 3D distance obtained sensitivity = 72%, specificity = 80%, positive predictive value = 56%, and negative predictive value = 89%.

Here, we report the elucidation of the biological characteristics of the two most prevalent uterine leiomyoma subtypes, MED12-mutant (MED12-LM) and HMGA2-overexpressing (HMGA2-LM) uterine leiomyomas. Because each tumor carries only one genetic alteration, both subtypes are considered to be monoclonal. Approximately 90% of cells in HMGA2-uterine leiomyoma were smooth muscle cells (SMC) with HMGA2 overexpression. In contrast, MED12-LM consisted of similar numbers of SMC and non-SMC, which were mostly tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAF). Paradoxically, TAF carried no mutations in MED12, suggesting an interaction between SMC and TAF to coordinate their growth. The higher amount of extracellular matrix in MED12-LM than HMGA2-LM was partially due to the high concentration of collagen-producing TAF. SMC growth in a xenograft assay was driven by progesterone in both uterine leiomyoma subtypes. In contrast, TAF in MED12-LM proliferated in response to estradiol, whereas progesterone had no effect. The high concentration of estrogen-responsive TAF in MED12-LM explains the inconsistent discoveries between in vivo and in vitro studies on the mitogenic effect of estrogen and raises questions regarding the accuracy of previous studies utilizing MED12-LM cell culture. In addition, the differential effects of estradiol and progesterone on these uterine leiomyoma subtypes emphasize the importance of subtypes and genotypes in designing nonsurgical therapeutic strategies for uterine leiomyoma. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",,Article,Scopus

Human AT100 nuclear tau, endowed by phosphorylation in Thr212/Ser214, was recently shown to decline in cornus ammonis 1 (CA1) and dentate gyrus (DG) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but a defined function for this nuclear tau remains unclear. Here we show that AT100 progressively increases in the nuclei of neuronal and non-neuronal cells during aging, and decreases in the more severe AD stages, as recently shown, and in cancer cells (colorectal adenocarcinoma and breast cancer). AT100, in addition to a co-localization with the DAPI-positive heterochromatin, was detected in the nucleolus of pyramidal cells from the CA1 region, shown to be at its highest level in the more senescent cells and in the first stage of AD (ADI), and disappearing in the more severe AD cases (ADIV). Taking into account the nuclear distribution of AT100 during cell aging and its relation to the chromatin changes observed in degenerated neurons, as well as in cancerous cells, which are both cellular pathologies associated with age, we can consider the Thr212/Ser214 phosphorylated nuclear tau as a molecular marker of cell aging. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Aging; Aging marker; Alzheimer disease; AT100; Breast acinar cells; Cancer; Colorectal mucosa; Confocal microscopy; Epithelial cells; Neurons; Nuclear tau",Article,Scopus

The present review summarizes recent knowledge on the induction and repair of DNA damage, DNA damage response (DDR) signaling, the main repair pathways and their role in the maintenance of genomic stability and, in case of failure, the relationship to cancer development. Because of the multiplicity and variation of damage inflicted on human cells from endogenous and exogenous sources (normal cell metabolism and mutagenic chemical and physical agents), cells have developed an effective strategy to cope with such internal and external stresses: (1) rapid signaling of the damage, (2) activation of prominent effector proteins by phosphokinases such as ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs, (3) induction of cell cycle arrest leaving time for the mobilization of lesion and metabolic state-adapted DNA repair pathway(s). DDR and DNA repair are highly dependent on genetic and epigenetic control mechanisms including modifications in chromatin structure. Complex lesions such as DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) arising from stalled replication forks, repair intermediates or directly induced chemical or radiation-induced damage are the most refractory to accurate repair. Single-strand breaks, base modifications, and some adducts are more easily repaired than complex lesions such as DNA DSBs or interstrand crosslinks. Inaccurate repair leads to mutations, chromosomal and genomic instability and is cancer prone. The repair pathways (mismatch repair, Base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination) are very accurate, however, nonhomologous endjoining (NHEJ) and its variant, alternative NHEJ (Alt-NHEJ) are inaccurate. The latter shows that cells tend to use components from other repair systems when certain lesions cannot be completely repaired by one of the main pathways because functional repair proteins are absent (e.g., proteins such as KU, DNA-PKcs, and LigIV are missing). In that case, although acting sequentially in a concerted manner, the fidelity of DNA repair decreases, whereas genomic instability and susceptibility to cancer increases. Detailed analyses of the different repair systems show that they are very closely embedded in normal cellular metabolic networks. Future systems biology analysis of these networks should allow further insights into the relationship between failures in DNA repair and carcinogenic outcomes to the benefit of a better understanding of the mechanisms involved, predictions of carcinogenic risks and the development of new anticancer treatment modalities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Alt-NHEJ; Base excision repair (BER); Carcinogenicity; Class switch recombination; Direct reversal (DR); DNA damage; DNA repair pathways; Homologous recombination (HR); Human cancer-prone repair syndromes; Interstrand crosslink repair; Mismatch repair (MMR); Nonhomologous endjoining (NHEJ); Nucleotide excision repair (NER); V(D)J recombination",Book Chapter,Scopus

Since then at least 6 members of this family have been identified in mammals. One of them called PAK1 has been best studied so far, mainly because it is essential not only for malignant cell growth and metastasis, but also for many other diseases/disorders such as diabetes (type 2), AD (Alzheimer's disease), hypertension, and a variety of inflammatory or infectious diseases, which definitely shorten our lifespan. Moreover, PAK1-deficient mutant of C. elegans lives longer than the wild-type by 60%, clearly indicating that PAK1 is not only an oncogenic but also ageing kinase. Thus, in theory, both anti-oncogenic and longevity-promoting activities are among the “intrinsic” properties or criteria of “clinically useful” PAK1-blockers. There are a variety of PAK1-blocking natural products such as propolis and curcumin which indeed extend the healthy lifespan of small animals such as C. elegans by inducing the autophagy. Recently, we managed to synthesize a series of potent water-soluble and highly cell-permeable triazolyl esters of COOH-bearing PAK1-blockers such as Ketorolac, ARC (artepillin C) and CA (caffeic acid) via “Click Chemistry” that boosts their anti-cancer activity over 500-fold, mainly by increasing their cell-permeability, and one of them called 15K indeed extends the lifespan of C. elegans.

The pharmacological potential is evaluated by using many bioassays particularly in the field of cancerology, immunology, and microbiology. The adjuvant concept is well known for these molecules in vaccines, but there is little preclinical evidence to support this concept in the management of cancer, infections and inflammation. Purpose We aim to review some examples of triterpene glycosides from natural sources which exhibit adjuvant activity when they are co-adminitered with anticancer drugs, targeted toxins, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory drugs and with antigens in vaccines. Methods The scientific literature on the adjuvant potential of triterpene glycosides covering mainly the last two decades has been identified by using relevant key words in the databases, using the online service such as Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar. Results We divided these findings in four kind of examples, the combination of triterpene glycosides (1) with chemotherapeutic agents in conventional tumor therapies and with targeted toxins, (2) with antimicrobial drugs, (3) with antiinflammatory drugs, and (4) with an antigen in prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. Pharmacological studies have revealed that some triterpene glycosides co-administered with anticancer drugs such as cisplatin, paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, 5-fluorouracyl, mitoxantrone exhibited increased cytotoxicity in tumor cells better than when the drugs were administered alone. However in vivo toxicological and pharmacokinetic studies are required before the combination strategy can be applied into clinical practice. Other studies showed that combined application of triterpene glycosides with targeted toxins resulted in the increased efficacy of the toxin, simultaneously reducing the dosage, and side effects. It was also shown that the co-administration of the triterpenoids with corticosteroids synergistically inhibited the inflammatory response induced by carrageenan in rats. The search for new alternative adjuvants in vaccines in comparison with the aluminium salts inducing only a Th2-type immune response resulted in the discovery of the promising purified fraction QS-21 from Quillaja saponaria, which has been used in the development of a variety of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. Over 120 clinical trials for around 20 vaccine indications in infectious diseases, cancer, degenerative disorders have been reported involving more than 50,000 patients. Conclusion This review summarized the successfull in vitro and in vivo studies showing that this combination approach of triterpene glycosides co-adminitered with anticancer, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory drug may provide an exciting road for further developments in the treatment of some cancers, parasitic and inflammatory diseases and in the rational design of vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer. From a clinical point of view, the potential benefit of QS-21, a promising triterpene glycoside from Quillaja saponaria has been highlighted in several vaccine clinical trials with a favorable ratio efficacy/toxicity. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Adjuvant; Antiinflammatory; Antimicrobial; Cancer; QS-21; Targeted toxins; Triterpene glycosides; Vaccines",Article,Scopus

Sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis is one of the most important prognostic indicators for melanoma survival. We present several machine learning models for predicting SLN metastasis using data from a real-world dermatology electronic health record (EHR) system. The class label is the result of a sentinel lymph node biopsy, an elective procedure that can be performed for newly-diagnosed melanoma patients to determine if there is metastasis in the nearest lymph node. We show that a simple model, using solely Breslow thickness, can achieve predictive performance (AUC=0.769) comparable to a logistic regression model using 5 features (AUC=0.772, p=0.518). Current clinical recommendations are to perform a biopsy for patients with melanomas thicker than 1mm, however, when applying this 1mm threshold to the simple thickness model, it achieves 0% sensitivity for melanomas &lt;1mm. Using a random forest model, we achieve 78.9% sensitivity (p&lt;0.001) for melanomas &lt;1mm. Our study shows that the probability of sentinel lymph node positivity is indeed linearly correlated to the tumor thickness (R2=0.934), and that machine learning models can effectively detect thin melanomas that warrant an SLN biopsy. © 2017 IEEE.","clinical decision support; machine learning; melanoma; sentinel node; skin cancer",Conference Paper,Scopus

METHODS: An immunohistochemical digital analysis of PD-L1, PD-1, CD4, and CD8 was performed on nephrectomy specimens from 118 sRCC patients and 92 nonsarcomatoid clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients. The clinical characteristics of the population were compared between sRCC and ccRCC. Overall survival was estimated, and comparisons were made between PD-L1–positive and PD-L1–negative groups as well as tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)–high and TIL-low groups. RESULTS: The PD-L1 H-score of sRCC (mean, 3.7; range, 0-192.1) was significantly higher than the score of grade 4 ccRCC (P =.001), and 41.3% of sRCC cases showed a PD-L1 H-score ≥ 10. The PD-1–positive cell density was significantly higher in sRCC versus ccRCC within the tumor and at the invasive front. The intratumoral CD8-positive cell density was significantly higher in sRCC versus ccRCC. Forty-one percent in the sarcomatoid component of sRCC and 8% in the epithelioid component of sRCC had an adaptive immune resistance phenotype (PD-L1–positive and TIL-positive), whereas only 1% in ccRCC had the type I phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: sRCC showed higher PD-L1 expression and higher PD-1– and CD8-positive cell density than grade 4 ccRCC. The results indicate a notable immunosuppressive environment in sRCC. Despite advances in the treatment of advanced-stage renal cell carcinoma, sRCC still has a poor prognosis. This work describes highly immunosuppressive characteristics of sRCC in comparison with an appropriate ccRCC control. The results suggest PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy as a potential therapeutic approach for sRCC.

To improve the anticancer activity of isocorydine derivatives, twenty derivatives of NICD were designed and synthesized through chemical structure modifications of the aromatic amino group at C-8. The anti-proliferative activities of all synthesized compounds against human hepatocellular (HepG2), cervical (HeLa), and gastric (MGC-803) cancer cell lines were evaluated using an MTT assay. The results showed that all the synthetic compounds had some tumor cell growth inhibitory activity.

FICD (12) and COM33 (24) were selected for further investigation of their in vitro and in vivo activities due to their relatively good antiproliferative properties.

This study evaluated 87 chemokine and cytokine associated SNPs in obese and normal weight cases (N = 109) and controls (N = 102) using a stepwise penalized logistic regression approach in multivariable analyses. Upon stratification by WHR (normal weight (WHR < 0.90) or obese (WHR ≥ 0.90)), inheritance of CCR6 rs2023305 AG + GG (OR = 1.75, p = 0.007), CCR9 rs7613548 AG + GG (OR = 1.71, p = 0.012) and IL10ra rs2229113 AG + GG (OR = 1.45, p = 0.01) genotypes was associated with increase in overall or low grade (Gleason score < 7) PC risk among normal weight men. These odds were elevated among obese men who possessed the CCR5 rs1799987 AG + GG (OR = 1.95, p = 0.003) and RNASEL rs12135247 CT + TT genotypes (OR = 1.59, p = 0.05). CCR7 rs3136685 AG + GG (p = 0.032) was associated with a 1.52–1.70 fold increase in the risk of high grade cancer (Gleason score ≥ 7) among obese men. CCR7 variant emerged as an important factor associated with high grade PC risk among obese men in our analyses. Overall, genetic loci found significant in normal weight men were not significant in obese men and vice-versa, partially explaining the role of obesity on PC risk among black men. Also, older age was an important risk factor both in normal weight and obese men but only with regard to low grade PC. Associations of inflammatory SNPs with obesity are suggestive and require further validation in larger cohorts to help develop an understanding of PC risk among obese and non-obese men of African descent. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Black; Obesity; Prostate cancer; Single nucleotide polymorphisms; Waist to hip ratio",Article,Scopus

Local flaps are one of the options in reconstruction of small to moderate sized defects of oral cavity. Reconstruction is an integral part of the surgical management of oral cancer. Every defect needs to be assessed individually to tailor made the reconstruction because of its multidimensionality and complexity. Varieties of autologous tissues are being used in reconstruction like local, regional, or free flaps which can be simple or complex tissues. There is always a trend to identify the newer flaps/technique to personalize reconstruction. Local flaps are also one of the options in reconstruction of small to moderate sized defects of oral cavity. Local tissue if it is available is in the primary surgeon's purview and the flap can be raised without much technical difficulty and morbidity. We used perforator based tissue from the face and neck which is richly supplied by the facial vessels and named as the Cervicofacial- Facial Artery Myocutaneous flap (C-FAM flap) for reconstruction of oral cavity. Methods: We used perforator based local tissue from the face and neck which is supplied by facial vessels and named it as the C-FAM flap for the reconstruction of oral cavity defects. Results: Twenty-eight patients underwent C-FAM flap reconstruction in different subsites of the oral cavity with acceptable functional rehabilitation. There was no flap loss. Conclusion: The C-FAM flap is a robust flap, which is reliable, pliable, and rich in its vascularity. It has to be one of the armamentarium for the oral cavity reconstruction.

By means of these catabolic end-products and by removal of pro-oxidant heme, HO-1 exerts antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and immune-modulating effects, leading to overall cytoprotective and beneficial functions in mammalian cells. Therefore, HO-1 is considered a survival molecule in various stress-related conditions. By contrast, growing evidence suggests that HO-1 is a survival-enhancing molecule also in various solid and blood cancers, such as various types of leukemia, promoting carcinogenesis, tumor progression, and chemo-resistance. Among leukemias, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is currently therapeutically well treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as Imatinib (IM) and its congeners; nevertheless, resistance to all kinds of current drugs persist in a number of patients. Moreover, treatment outcomes for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain unsatisfactory, despite progress in chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Therefore, identification of new eligible targets that may improve leukemias therapy is of general interest. Several recent papers prove that inhibition of HO-1 through HO-1 inhibitors as well as modulation of other pathways involving HO-1 by a number of different new or known molecules, are critical for leukemia treatment. This review summarizes the current understanding of the pro-tumorigenic role of HO-1 and its potential as a molecular target for the treatment of leukemias. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS","Acute myeloid leukemia; Chronic myeloid leukemia; Heme oxygenase; HO-1 inhibition; Imatinib; Tyrosine kinase inhibitors",Review,Scopus

A large amount of genomic and molecular data indicate that alterations occur at multiple scales in different stages of melanoma. Metabolic rewiring is a characteristic feature of progressive cancers that facilitates sustenance of tumors, and caters to the changing energy requirements. Since such rewiring involves multiple variations in the metabolic network that are orchestrated, a systems perspective is necessary to understand the nature, significance, mechanisms and identification of the key steps. To address this, we integrate patient transcriptome data with a prior human reference metabolic model and construct stage-specific genome-scale metabolic models. Using flux balance analysis, we simulate the metabolic flows and compute the reaction fluxes specific to normal skin, primary melanoma and metastatic melanoma, from which the reactions with flux differences between conditions were identified. Reactions related to Warburg effect, as anticipated and in addition, ROS detoxification and tyrosine metabolism were largely altered in all stages of melanoma. Vitamin A and Vitamin C sub-systems are identified to be involved in different stages, consistent with experimental studies from literature that indicate their support to cancer progression. Gene essentiality studies using the melanoma model identified 5 important genes NME2, CMPK1, HSD17B4, DTYMK and PRODH for the proliferation of melanoma cells, which can be explored as potential drug targets. © 2017 IEEE.","flux balance analysis; Melanoma; metabolic model",Conference Paper,Scopus

In this study, we are proposing for the first time to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo oncolytic capacities of the Cowpox virus (CPXV). To improve the tumor selectivity and oncolytic activity, we developed a thymidine kinase (TK)-deleted CPXV expressing the suicide gene FCU1, which converts the non-toxic prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) into cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 5-fluorouridine-5′-monophosphate (5-FUMP). This TK-deleted virus replicated efficiently in human tumor cell lines; however, it was notably attenuated in normal primary cells, thus displaying a good therapeutic index. Furthermore, this new recombinant poxvirus rendered cells sensitive to 5-FC. In vivo, after systemic injection in mice, the TK-deleted variant caused significantly less mortality than the wild-type strain. A biodistribution study demonstrated high tumor selectivity and low accumulation in normal tissues. In human xenograft models of solid tumors, the recombinant CPXV also displayed high replication, inducing relevant tumor growth inhibition. This anti-tumor effect was improved by 5-FC co-administration. These results demonstrated that CPXV is a promising oncolytic vector capable of expressing functional therapeutic transgenes. © 2017 The Author(s)","armed; cowpox; oncolytic",Article,Scopus

In the original study, we focused on the SNP-disease association test but did not provide knowledge regarding the underlying XCI models. One can use the highest likelihood ratio (LLR) to select XCI models (max-LLR approach). However, that approach does not formally compare the LLRs corresponding to different XCI models to assess whether the models are distinguishable. Therefore, we propose an LLR comparison procedure (comp-LLR approach), inspired by the Cox test, to formally compare the LLRs of different XCI models to select the most likely XCI model that describes the underlying XCI process. We conduct simulation studies to investigate the max-LLR and comp-LLR approaches. The simulation results show that compared with the max-LLR, the comp-LLR approach has higher probability of identifying the correct underlying XCI model for the scenarios when the underlying XCI process is random XCI, escaping XCI, or skewed XCI to the deleterious allele.

Here, we examined whether the DNA damage response (DDR) could be a primary cytotoxic event underlying xanthatin-mediated anti-tumor activity. Using EdU incorporation assay in combination with novel imaging flow cytometry, our data indicated that xanthatin suppressed DNA replication, prevented cells from G2/M entry and increased the spot count of γH2AX nuclear foci. Given that checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) represents a core component in DDR-mediated cell cycle transition and the phosphorylation on Ser-345 is essential for kinase activation and function, we surprisingly found xanthatin distinctly modulated Ser-345 phosphorylation of Chk1 in A549 and H1299 cells. Further investigation on Cdc25C/CDK1/CyclinB1 signaling cascade in the absence or presence of pharmacological DDR inhibitors showed that xanthatin directly destabilized the protein levels of Cdc25C, and recovery of p53 expression in p53-deficient H1299 cells further intensified xanthatin-mediated inhibition of Cdc25C, suggesting p53-dependent regulation of Cdc25C in a DDR machinery. Moreover, exogenous expression of Cdc25C was also substantially repressed by xanthatin and partially impaired xanthatin-induced G2 arrest. In addition, xanthatin could induce accumulation of ubiquitinated Cdc25C without undergoing further proteasomal degradation. However, an alternative lysosomal proteolysis of Cdc25C was observed. Interestingly, lysosome-like vesicles were produced upon xanthatin treatment, accompanied by rapid accumulation of lysosomal associated membrane protein LAPM-1. Furthermore, vacuolar proton (V)-ATPases inhibitor bafilomycin A1 and lysosomal proteases inhibitor leupeptin could remarkably overturn the levels of Cdc25C in xanthatin-treated H1299 cells.

The degradation ration and cumulative release in vitro and in vivo of the sustained-release implants were determined separately. The effect of methotrexate sustained-release implants on delayed sarcoma recurrence was explored. The methotrexate sustained-release implants made herein were compared with traditional delivery system to explore their clinical superiority and advantages. Methods: PLGA and PEG4000 were used as excipients and hot-melting extrusion method was applied to fabricate methotrexate sustained-release implants, whose cumulative release ratio in vitro and in vivo were measured by UV and HPLC, respectively. HPLC was also applied to determine the drug actual contents in the produced implants. KM mice were inoculated subcutaneously with Sarcoma 180 cells at the axillary region to simulate postoperative residual lesions. Adjuvant chemotherapy after radical operation model was fabricated and the effect of local administration of methotrexate sustained-release implants on delayed sarcoma recurrence was evaluated. Results: Yellow uniform methotrexate sustained-release implants with a diameter of 0.88 mm were successfully fabricated by hot-melting extrusion method. Further characterization results demonstrated that drug actual content was up to (8.34±0.65)%, which was consistent with theoretical content. Methotrexate sustained-release implants we made herein could maintain a sustained and controlled release up to 7 d in vitro release and 15 d in vivo release respectively. Compared with traditional delivery system, methotrexate sustained-release implants prepared in this research were more effective in delaying tumor recurrence and prolonging the survival of mice and the implants could avoid some adverse effects. Conclusion: Hot-melting extrusion method can be applied successfully to fabricate methotrexate sustained-release implants, which have the advantages such as controlled slow-release and long-acting, and then can overcome some shortcomings and defects of the administration method of methotrexate, and might be a promising formulation for delaying local tumor recurrence. © 2017, Chinese Journal of New Drugs Co.

We have developed a new liposomal preparation of oxaliplatin (l-OHP), an important anti-tumor drug for treatment of colorectal cancer, using PEGylated liposomes (Lipo-l-OHP), and showed that Lipo-l-OHP exhibits increased anti-tumor activity in tumor-bearing mice compared to the original preparation of l-OHP. However, whether Lipo-l-OHP causes HFS-like skin toxicity similar to Lipo-DXR remains to be determined. Administration of Lipo-l-OHP promoted accumulation of platinum in rat hind paws, however, it caused negligible morphological and histological alterations on the plantar surface of the paws. Administration of DiI-labeled empty PEGylated liposomes gave almost the same distribution profile of dyes into the dermis of hind paws with DXR as in the case of Lipo-DXR.

Pesticides contamination in agriculture fields has become an unavoidable problem, as pesticides are used to increase paddy productivity and reduce plant disease. Human exposure to agrichemicals is common and could results in both acute and chronic health effects, such as acute and chronic neurotoxicity. This study aims to determine the concentrations of commonly used pesticides (azoxystrobin, buprofezin, chlorantraniliprole, difenoconazole, fipronil, imidacloprid, isoprothiolane, pretilachlor, propiconazole, pymetrozine, tebuconazole, tricyclazole, and trifloxystrobin) in personal air samples and their associated health risks among paddy farmers. Eighty-three farmers from Tangjung Karang, Selangor were involved in this study. A solid sorbent tube was attached to the farmer's breathing zone with a clip, and an air pump was fastened to the belt to collect personal air samples. Pesticides collected in the XAD-2 resin were extracted with acetone, centrifuged, concentrated via nitrogen blowdown and reconstituted with 1 mL of 3:1 ultrapure water/HPLC-grade methanol solution. The extract was analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The target compounds were detected with a maximum concentration reaching up to 462.5 ng m − 3 (fipronil). The hazard quotient (HQ) was less than 1 and the hazard index (HI) value was 3.86 × 10 − 3 , indicating that the risk of pesticides related diseases was not significant. The lifetime cancer risk (LCR) for pymetrozine was at an acceptable level (LCR &lt; 10 − 6 ) with 4.10 × 10 − 8 . The results reported in this study can be beneficial in terms of risk management within the agricultural community. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Hazard quotient (HQ); Inhalation; Lifetime cancer risk (LCR); Malaysia; Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM); Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS)",Article,Scopus

As with the first-line therapeutic bicalutamide (Casodex), resistance to newer antiandrogens (enzalutamide, ARN-509) develops quickly in patients, despite the fact that these drugs have ∼10-fold better affinity for the androgen receptor than bicalutamide. Improving affinity alone is often not sufficient to prevent resistance, and alternative strategies are needed to improve antiandrogen efficacy. Covalent and reversible covalent drugs are being used to thwart drug resistance in other contexts, and activated aryl nitriles are among the moieties being exploited for this purpose. We capitalized on the presence of an aryl nitrile in bicalutamide, and the existence of a native cysteine residue (Cys784) in the androgen receptor ligand binding pocket, to develop 5N-bicalutamide, a cysteine-reactive antiandrogen. 5N-bicalutamide exhibits a 150-fold improvement in Ki and 20-fold improvement in IC50 over the parent compound. We attribute the marked improvement in affinity and activity to the formation of a covalent adduct with Cys784, a residue that is not among the more than 160 androgen receptor point mutations associated with prostate cancer. Increasing the residence time of bound antiandrogen via formation of a covalent adduct may forestall the drug resistance seen with current clinical antiandrogens. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,Article,Scopus

Methods We performed a retrospective review of all patients diagnosed with cardiac melanoma at the Mayo Clinic from 1988 to 2015. Qualitative analysis was performed on patient demographics, clinical history, and imaging modalities. Results 11 patients (7 male, median age 63 years) were identified with cardiac melanoma. Shortness of breath (64%) was the most common presenting symptom. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was utilized in the assessment of all patients though it failed to identify 20% of masses that were seen on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). The majority of masses were located within the cardiac chambers (46% right atrium, 18% right ventricle, 18% left atrium), and 36% appeared mobile on TTE.

Numerous drugs that are currently in clinical practice have developed multidrug resistance along with fatal side effects. Therefore, the utilization of single-target therapy is incapable of providing an effective control on the malignant process. Molecular hybridization, involving a combination of two or more pharmacophores of bioactive scaffolds to generate a single molecular architecture with improved affinity and activity, in comparison to their parent molecules, has emerged as a promising strategy in recent drug discovery research. Hybrid anticancer drugs are of great therapeutic interests since they can potentially overcome most of the pharmacokinetic drawbacks encountered with conventional anticancer drugs. Strategically, the design of anticancer drugs involved the blending or linking of an anticancer drug with another anticancer drug or a carrier molecule which can efficiently target cancer cells with improved biological potential. Major advantages of hybrid anticancer drugs involved increased specificity, better patient compliance, and lower side effects along with reduction in chemo-resistance. The successful utilization of this technique in design and synthesis of novel anticancer hybrids has been well illustrated and documented in the literature.

Currently, sorafenib is the most effective molecular-targeted drug against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the sorafenib resistance rate is high. The molecular mechanism of this resistance has not been fully elucidated. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a multifaceted protein that plays a key role in the proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis and angiogenesis of HCC cells. In addition, HMGB1 has been suggested to contribute to chemotherapy resistance in tumours, including lung cancer, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, leukaemia, and colorectal cancer. This study investigated the association between HMGB1 and sorafenib resistance in HCC. Methods: HepG2 cells with HMGB1 knockdown or overexpression were generated. The efficacy of sorafenib in these cells was tested using flow cytometry and a cell counting assay. The subcellular localization of HMGB1 in HepG2 cells following sorafenib treatment was measured by western blotting and confocal microscopy. A murine subcutaneous HCC model was generated to examine the association between HMGB1 and the sensitivity of sorafenib treatment. Results: The HMGB1 knockdown cells exhibited a significantly higher apoptotic level and lower cell viability than the normal HMGB1 expressing cells following the sorafenib treatment. In addition, the cell viability observed in the HMGB1 overexpressing cells was higher than that observed in the control cells following the sorafenib intervention. Sorafenib had a better tumour inhibition effect in the HMGB1 knockdown group in vivo. The amount of mitochondrial HMGB1 decreased, while the amount of cytosolic HMGB1 increased following the exposure to sorafenib. Altogether, HMGB1 translocated from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm outside the mitochondria following the exposure of HepG2 cells to sorafenib. Conclusions: A novel potential role of HMGB1 in the regulation of sorafenib therapy resistance in HCC was observed. The knockdown of HMGB1 restores sensitivity to sorafenib and enhances HepG2 cell death, while HMGB1 overexpression blunts these effects. The translocation of HMGB1 from the mitochondria to the cytosol following sorafenib treatment provides new insight into sorafenib resistance in HCC. © 2017 The Author(s).","HCC; HMGB1; Mitochondria; Sorafenib resistance",Article,Scopus

However, limited DNA methylation-based biomarkers have been described in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods: A high-throughput DNA methylation dataset (100 samples) of ESCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project was analyzed and validated along with another independent dataset (12 samples) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The methylation status of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and peripheral blood leukocytes from healthy controls was also utilized for biomarker selection. The candidate CpG sites as well as their adjacent regions were further validated in 94 pairs of ESCC tumor and adjacent normal tissues from the Chinese Han population using the targeted bisulfite sequencing method. Logistic regression and several machine learning methods were applied for evaluation of the diagnostic ability of our panel. Results: In the discovery stage, five hyper-methylated CpG sites were selected as candidate biomarkers for further analysis as shown below: cg15830431, P = 2.20 × 10-4; cg19396867, P = 3.60 × 10-4; cg20655070, P = 3.60 × 10-4; cg26671652, P = 5.77 × 10-4; and cg27062795, P = 3.60 × 10-4. In the validation stage, the methylation status of both the five CpG sites and their adjacent genomic regions were tested. The diagnostic model based on the combination of these five genomic regions yielded a robust performance (sensitivity = 0.75, specificity = 0.88, AUC = 0.85). Eight statistical models along with five-fold cross-validation were further applied, in which the SVM model reached the best accuracy in both training and test dataset (accuracy = 0.82 and 0.80, respectively). In addition, subgroup analyses revealed a significant difference in diagnostic performance between the alcohol use and non-alcohol use subgroups.

Activating mutations in Gsα gene (GNAS) have been reported to be associated with poor prognosis in various human carcinomas. Furthermore, Gsα signaling is crucial in promoting liver regeneration by interacting with growth factor signaling, indicating that Gsα might play a promoting role in cancer development. However, little is known about the correlation between Gsα levels and clinicopathological parameters in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Methods We performed immunoblotting to examine the expression levels of Gsα and Ki67 proteins in tumor tissues and the corresponding adjacent tissues. A total of 74 pair of specimens resected from 74 ICC patients were examined. The association between Gsα levels and clinicopathological findings and prognosis of the patients was evaluated. Results Western blotting demonstrated that the expression of Gsα was significantly higher in ICC tissues compared with that in their corresponding adjacent tissues. Gsα protein was highly expressed in about half of ICC tissues (48.6%, 36/74) while only 28.4% (21/74) of tumor adjacent tissues showed Gsα high expression (P=0.011). High Gsα expression in ICC was significantly associated with the numbers of tumor nodules (P=0.037) and lymph node metastases (P=0.010). Moreover, the level of Gsα was significantly and positively correlated with Ki67 expression (P&lt;0.001). In addition, the recurrence-free survival rate and overall survival rate in the Gsα high group were significantly lower than those in the Gsα low group (P=0.004 and P=0.005, respectively). Conclusions High Gsα expression is correlated with poor prognosis in ICC patients. Gsα might serve as a potential prognostic indicator of ICC. © 2017 The Editorial Board of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Diseases International","Gsα; immunohistochemistry; intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; prognosis",Article,Scopus

Here, we report an in-depth analysis on the thermodynamics of FAD binding to one of the most representative examples of such relationship, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). NQO1 is a dimeric enzyme that tightly binds FAD, which triggers large structural changes upon binding. A common cancer-associated polymorphism (P187S) severely compromises FAD binding. We show that FAD binding is described well by a thermodynamic model explicitly incorporating binding cooperativity when applied to different sets of calorimetric analyses and NQO1 variants, thus providing insight on the effects in vitro and in cells of cancer-associated P187S, its suppressor mutation H80R and the role of NQO1 C-terminal domain to modulate binding cooperativity and energetics. Furthermore, we show that FAD binding to NQO1 is very sensitive to physiologically relevant environmental conditions, such as the presence of phosphate buffer and salts. Overall, our results contribute to understanding at the molecular level the link between NQO1 stability and fluctuations of FAD levels intracellularly, and supports the notion that FAD binding energetics and cooperativity are fundamentally linked with the dynamic nature of apo-NQO1 conformational ensemble. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Cancer; Cooperativity; Flavin binding; Mutation; Oxidoreductase; Thermodynamics",Article,Scopus

The combination of aspirin and sorafenib resulted in a synergistic antitumor effect against liver tumors both in vitro and in vivo. High glycolysis and PFKFB3 overexpression occupied a dominant position in sorafenib resistance, and can be targeted and overcome by aspirin.

The performance of pediatric early warning systems (PEWS) to identify deterioration has not been assessed in these settings. This study evaluates the validity of PEWS to predict the need for unplanned transfer to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) among pediatric oncology patients in a resource-limited hospital. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study comparing the highest documented and corrected PEWS score before unplanned PICU transfer in pediatric oncology patients (129 cases) with matched controls (those not requiring PICU care) was performed. RESULTS: Documented and corrected PEWS scores were found to be highly correlated with the need for PICU transfer (area under the receiver operating characteristic, 0.940 and 0.930, respectively). PEWS scores increased 24 hours prior to unplanned transfer (P =.0006). In cases, organ dysfunction at the time of PICU admission correlated with maximum PEWS score (correlation coefficient, 0.26; P =.003), patients with PEWS results ≥4 had a higher Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 (PIM2) (P =.028), and PEWS results were higher in patients with septic shock (P =.01). The PICU mortality rate was 17.1%; nonsurvivors had higher mean PEWS scores before PICU transfer (P =.0009). A single-point increase in the PEWS score increased the odds of mechanical ventilation or vasopressors within the first 24 hours and during PICU admission (odds ratio 1.3-1.4). CONCLUSIONS: PEWS accurately predicted the need for unplanned PICU transfer in pediatric oncology patients in this resource-limited setting, with abnormal results beginning 24 hours before PICU admission and higher scores predicting the severity of illness at the time of PICU admission, need for PICU interventions, and mortality. These results demonstrate that PEWS aid in the identification of clinical deterioration in this high-risk population, regardless of a hospital's resource-level.

Pracinostat is reported to have modest clinical activity in patients with advanced solid tumors. Given the higher preclinical sensitivity of hematologic malignancies to pracinostat, the authors conducted a phase 1 study to assess the safety, maximum tolerated dose, recommended phase 2 dose, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of pracinostat in patients with advanced hematological malignancies. METHODS: Pracinostat was administered orally 3 times a week for 3 weeks on a 28-day cycle. Patients were assigned to 7 dose levels using a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients were enrolled, 25 of whom had AML and 14 of whom had myelodysplastic syndrome. The maximum tolerated dose was 120 mg and the recommended phase 2 dose was 60 mg. Two patients with AML achieved a response: 1 complete remission (CR) and 1 complete cytogenetic response. Despite a dose-dependent increase in the plasma concentration of pracinostat, a similar increase in histone acetylation was not observed. As an extension, 10 additional patients with myelodysplastic syndrome were enrolled to assess the safety and efficacy of pracinostat in combination with azacitidine. Six patients achieved a CR and 3 achieved a CR without platelet recovery with no added toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrate that pracinostat is safe, with modest single-agent activity in patients with hematological malignancies.

Methods: The phenotypic and functional characteristics of Regulatory T (Treg) CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ subsets in OSCC patients were assessed by multicolor flow cytometry and its effector component (TGF-β) by Western blot and qRT-PCR. Results: An increased (P &lt; 0.05) prevalence of Treg phenotypes (CD4+CD25+, CD4+FoxP3+, CD8+FoxP3+, CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) was observed in the peripheral circulation of OSCC patients that positively correlated with clinicopathological features. The increased frequency of CD4+CD8+CD25+FoxP3+, a unique T cell subset, CTLA-4+, GITR+, NrP1+, HLA-DR+, CD127+, Tbet+, TGF-β+, and granzyme B+ (GzmB) Tregs also showed a significantly higher prevalence in OSCC patients. Functionally, CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs showed skewed expression of IL-2, IL-10, and IL-35 in patients as compared with the normal controls.

While the purpose of fusion in the biomedical domain is to create a more holistic picture of biological reality, latent sensitivities of the fusion process often result in information loss. It has been shown that biomedical data fusion is sensitive to granularity dimensions, scales of semantic relationships across specificity and mereology. Low granularity data casts a wide net, while high granularity data has focus. When data fusion occurs between low and high granularities, these benefits counteract each other. In this study, we reexamine the union function as a basis for biomedical data fusions, via comparison to a granularity-aware function. This granularity-aware approach uses domain knowledge (low granularity) as a filter for expression relationships (high granularity). We use pancreatic cancer expression data and domain knowledge networks to test the fusion approaches. We support previous findings that granularity-unaware fusion allows domain knowledge to eclipse condition-specific data. In addition, we find that the granularity-aware approach tends to outperform both the union and non-fusion networks, resulting in higher information extraction scores. Further, the granularity-aware approach increases the network information extraction effect size between disease and normal networks, allowing for a more distinctive delineation between the two conditions. © 2017 IEEE.","data fusion; granularity; information extraction; information loss",Conference Paper,Scopus

Exposure of human serum albumin to physiologically relevant copper concentrations for 21 days resulted in structural modifications in the protein which were evident by changes in the intrinsic florescence. A loss of the predominantly alpha helical structure of human serum albumin was recorded along with a tendency to form protein aggregates. This aggregation was characterized by Thioflavin T and Congo Red assays. Rayleigh light scattering and turbidity assays confirmed aggregation.

Acetylation of arylhydroxylamines and the transfer of an acetyl group from the O to N group of arylacetohydroxates generally result in activation particularly of arylamine carcinogens to produce N-acetoxyesters. The polymorphic NAT enzymes were very important in establishing the basics of pharmacogenetics through the metabolism of the antitubercular hydrazine isoniazid. There are now known to be two human isoenzymes: NAT2 responsible for isoniazid metabolism and NAT1, also polymorphic, which is more specific for p-aminosalicylate (pAS) and p-aminobenzoic acid (p-aba) and the folate catabolite, p-aminobenzoylglutamate (p-abaglu). The polymorphism in NAT1 and NAT2 is primarily through a series of SNPs that occur in haplotypes in the single-exon coding region of these genes. Amino acid substitutions result in destabilized protein with mutant versions being degraded in the proteasome following ubiquitination. There are NAT enzymes in mammalian (apart from canids), nonmammalian, and also bacterial species. Transgenic mice are helping to unravel the endogenous role of human NAT1 that is widespread in tissues, expressed very early in development and overexpressed in estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer. It is likely that the NAT1 enzyme has a role in maintaining folate and acetyl CoA homeostasis through its role as a folate-dependent acetyl CoA hydrolase.Control of expression of NAT genes is beginning to be understood in relation to the splicing patterns of the noncoding exons, which appear to be tissue-specific for human NAT1, but more work is needed in understanding the epigenetic control particularly in the light of findings of overexpression of human NAT1 in male and female breast cancers and the proposal that NAT1 is a target for cancer therapy and a diagnostic marker.In all NATs that have been studied, the reaction mechanism is through an acetylated cysteine intermediate, with the cysteine being activated through a catalytic triad with histidine and aspartate. The structures of the bacterial and the human enzymes have identified the acetyl CoA binding sites that are subtly different. While the catalytic triads of the various NAT enzymes are superimposable, as is the three-domain core structure, the C-terminus and an interdomain loop in the human enzymes occlude the active-site cleft, and this may allow a different range of functions for the bacterial enzymes, particularly from the mycobacteria that, from gene deletion studies, have a role in the formation of cell wall lipids. The role of NATs in fungi with malonyl CoA as the acyl donor emphasizes the plurality of roles of NAT homologues and opens up an area of ecotoxicology.Structural studies and in silico and combinatorial screening with recombinant NATs have identified specific inhibitors for different NAT homologues-human NAT1 and also mycobacterial NAT. These have been explored as diagnostic and therapeutic agents. The availability of transgenic model organisms, efficient gene deletion methods, and inhibition of transcription technologies will allow the role of NAT in toxicology to be addressed at many levels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Acetyl CoA; Active-site cysteine; Arylamines; Biomarker; Breast cancer; Carcinogenesis; Catalytic triad; Fungi; Isoniazid; Mycobacteria; N-Acetylation; NMR; P-Aminosalicylate; Pharmacogenetics; Polymorphisms; Protein structure; Systemic lupus erythematosus",Book Chapter,Scopus

Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), cryptorchidism, as well as some forms of hypospadias and male infertility are all components of TDS, and it was proposed that these disorders share a common etiology and pathogenesis. Links between these conditions are provided by epidemiological clues and from direct biological evidence that disruption of early testis development and impaired differentiation of cell populations are common features. Main advances in our understanding of human TDS have arisen from studies of germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS), cells with features of transformed gonocytes which failed to differentiate, most likely due to a functional insufficiency of the somatic niche during fetal development. Direct evidence linking specific chemical exposures and disruption of early testis development is sparse. However the potential for direct impacts of chemical exposures and for interactions between the changing environment and the genomic landscape to result in heritable epigenetic changes in the germline are being explored. Molecular markers indicate that testicular development and differentiation rely on largely conserved processes, so information gained from studies of nonhuman species is highly relevant for understanding human testicular cancer. To date, most available evidence in humans comes from the occurrence of genital malformations, especially cryptorchidism, which occur in early childhood. Toxicological studies of human adult manifestations, especially TGCT, are difficult for ethical reasons, highlighting the need for suitable animal models, such as rabbits or dogs. Although rodents are crucial for studying fundamental processes, their windows of susceptibility to endocrine disrupters appear different and TGCTs of the 'human type' do not develop. Further advances will arise from efforts to integrate knowledge of (1) the signaling mechanisms that govern key steps in the development and maturation of testicular cells, (2) the effects of toxicants on these processes in animal models and large case-control studies of human subjects with TDS, and (3) the common and species-specific features of normal and disrupted testicular growth.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 75 patients with pathology-confirmed thyroid diseases who underwent 18F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) within 3 months before undergoing thyroid surgery and miR-34a analysis from June 2012 to July 2017. 18F-FDG uptake of thyroid lesions was also analyzed semiquantitatively using maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). The association between miR-34a expression and clinicopathological variables (age, sex, TNM stage, histopathology, lesion numbers, location and 18F-FDG avidity) was investigated. When there were multiple lesions in thyroid bed, only the one with the highest 18F-FDG uptake was analyzed. Next, we inhibited the miR-34a expression in TPC-1 cells and detected the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) mRNA and protein. Results: In the patients cohort, miR-34a was upregulated in those with malignant thyroid diseases compared with benign lesions. The expression of miR-34a was associated with tumor stages, histopathological types and SUVmax. There was an inverse relationship between miR-34a expression and SUVmax in patients with thyroid diseases (Spearman correlation coefficient = –0.553, P < 0.0001). With an SUVmax of 4.3 as the threshold, sensitivity and specificity of the prediction of miR-34a expression (low or high) were 70% and 94.3%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.843 (95% confidence interval: 0.749, 0.936; P = 0.001).

One strategy to overcome this obstacle is to identify agents that are selectively lethal to MDR cells. The aim of this study was to discover novel compounds against MDR leukemia and to determine the molecular mechanisms behind collateral sensitivity. A library of 1162 compounds was tested against parental, drug-sensitive CCRF-CEM cells using the resazurin assay. A total of 302 compounds showed reasonable activity (less than 50% cell viability). Eleven out of 30 lawsone derivatives revealed considerable collateral sensitivity in MDR P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-overexpressing CEM/ADR5000 cells. They reduced β-catenin activity in a Wnt/β-catenin reporter cell line. Their activities significantly correlated with apolar desolvation (R = 0.819). Compound (1) (3-hydroxy-1,4-dioxo-N-phenyl-naphthalene-2-carboxamide) was the most active compound and dose-dependently down-regulated protein expression of β-catenin, c-MYC, Pgp and Frizzled 7. By molecular docking, we predicted that compound (1) bound to the palmitoyl-binding groove of the cysteine-rich domain of Frizzled-7 and Frizzled-8. Compound (1) neither stimulated ATPase activity of Pgp nor reactive oxygen species generation, both of which have been previously described as possible mechanisms of collateral sensitivity. Instead, we found that Wnt/β-catenin signaling was selectively inhibited in CEM/ADR5000 cells, but not in CCRF-CEM cells. In conclusion, we found for the first time that the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling may represent a novel molecular mechanism of collateral sensitivity in MDR cells. Wnt/β-catenin signaling, therefore, represents a potential therapeutic target for the selective killing of Pgp-mediated MDR. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Cancer; Collateral sensitivity; Drug resistance; Frizzled; Signal transduction",Article,Scopus

Although down-regulation of ECRG4 gene expression has been largely attributed to hypermethylation of CpG islands in the 5’untranslated region of the ECRG4 promoter, the mechanisms that underlie the dynamics of its regulation have never been systematically described. Here we show that the ECRG4 gene is widely expressed in human tissues and report that its core promoter lies between the − 780 to + 420 base pairs relative to the ATG start codon of the ECRG4 open reading frame. This sequence, which contains several CpG islands, also includes multiple overlapping Sp1 consensus binding sequences and a putative binding site for NF-kB activation. 5′RACE of mRNA derived from human leukocytes shows that ECRG4 transcription initiates from the guanidine at − 11 from the initiation ATG of the ECRG4 open reading frame. While there is no canonical TATA- or CAAT-boxes proximal to this translational initiation site, there is a distal TATA-sequence in the 5′UTR. This region was identified as the sequence targeted by hypermethylation because in vitro methylation of plasmids encoding the ECRG4 promoter abolish promoter activity and the treatment of Jurkat cells (which naturally express ECRG4) with the methylation inhibitor 5-AzaC, increases endogenous ECRG4 expression. Because ChIP assays show that Sp1 binds the ECRG4 promoter, that forced Sp1 expression trans-activates the ECRG4 promoter and Sp1 inhibition with mithramycin inhibits ECRG4 expression, we conclude that the dynamic positive and negative regulatory elements controlling ECRG4 expression include a counter regulation between promoter methylation and Sp1 activation. © 2017","Hypermethylation; Jurkat cells; Promoter; RACE; Sp1 transcription factor",Article,Scopus

Computational methods to detect inter-chromosomal rearrangements based on next-generation sequencing platforms face the big challenge of accurately predicting the location of sites spanned by a typically small number of reads, while the entire sample contains hundreds of millions of reads. In this work, we propose a method called TDJD that identifies the location of interchromosomal breakpoints corresponding to a large scale structural variations, in particular translocations and insertions. To reduce the huge dimension of the search space, we split candidate reads that can be potential break points into windows, and represent the windows as a sequence of binary fingerprints. We then search for the location of the breakpoint in the reference genome using Jaccard distance. We use a combination of parallel computing, search using Jaccard distance to solve the exact nearest neighbor problem. The dimensionality reduction takes advantage of an SSE multi-thread architecture to achieve efficient search. We applied our algorithm to identify several reads with breakpoints, including those characterizing the PAX8-PPARγ rearrangement, a frequent modification occurring in follicular thyroid cancer. Our results show that we could identify the breakpoints much faster than the previous method. We also compared our results to several recently published methods, and found that our method is faster than all other compared methods with high accuracy. © 2017 IEEE.",,Conference Paper,Scopus

By taking advantage of censored instances, survival analysis methods internally consider more samples than standard regression methods, which partially alleviates this data insufficiency problem. Whereas most existing survival analysis models merely focus on a single survival prediction task, when there are multiple related survival prediction tasks, we may benefit from the tasks relatedness. Simultaneously learning multiple related tasks, multi-task learning (MTL) provides a paradigm to alleviate data insufficiency by bridging data from all tasks and improves generalization performance of all tasks involved. Even though MTL has been extensively studied, there is no existing work investigating MTL for survival analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task survival analysis framework that takes advantage of both censored instances and task relatedness. Specifically, based on two common used task relatedness assumptions, i.e., low-rank assumption and cluster structure assumption, we formulate two concrete models, COX-TRACE and COX-cCMTL, under the proposed framework, respectively. We develop efficient algorithms and demonstrate the performance of the proposed multi-task survival analysis models on the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset.

These agents are labeled as carcinogens, although this effect is context-dependent. Certain agents increase the incidence of cancer by directly interacting with the genetic material or through its regulation. A number of compounds do not directly interact with the genetic material, yet they can increase the incidence of neoplasms under selected exposure conditions in appropriate animal models. Agents that are carcinogenic through nongenotoxic mechanisms display a threshold, are reversible in the early stages, and perturb gene expression. Some of these agents act by altering the processes involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. The liver has been extensively used as a model system to assess the mechanisms and processes involved in chemically induced carcinogenesis. The logical target of direct-acting carcinogens is the diploid population of hepatocytes. Many agents are able to alter cell proliferation or apoptosis and lead to a selective increase in the putatively preneoplastic population in the liver. Many of these nongenotoxic compounds may alter the growth of the preneoplastic cells in the liver resulting in their outgrowth. Perturbation of the ploidization process through modulation of hormonal control of this cell population provides an important mechanism in the development of preneoplastic and ultimately neoplastic lesions through a nongenotoxic mechanism. These promoting agents tend to act in a tissue-specific and sometimes in a species-specific manner. Understanding the relevance of the mechanism of perturbation of the outgrowth of preneoplastic cells in response to nongenotoxic agents is necessary to understand under what conditions of exposure they provide a risk of enhanced cancer development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Hepatic ploidy; Hormones; Liver carcinogenesis; Nongenotoxic carcinogens",Book Chapter,Scopus

We investigated the use of cystine knot proteins (CKPs) to direct MV activity. CKPs are short polypeptides that bind their targets with high affinity. We used a CKP that binds αvβ3, αvβ5, and α5β1 integrins with single-digit nanomolar affinity to retarget MV to the integrins (MV-CKPint). MV-CKPint infected, replicated in, and killed human glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), and melanoma cancer cells in vitro, all of which express the target integrins. MV-CKPint activity was competitively blocked by echistatin, an integrin binding peptide. When the CKP was cleaved from the viral H protein at an included protease site, virus activity was abrogated. When delivered intravenously (i.v.), the retargeted virus reached a subcutaneous glioblastoma tumor bed and produced cytopathic effects similar to that shown by intratumoral injection of the virus. Because these target integrins are overexpressed by tumor vascular endothelium, MV-CKPint may allow for effective therapy with i.v. injection. These results indicate for the first time that CKPs can be used to retarget MV for a receptor of choice. In addition, MV-CKPint provides proof of principle for the use of a CKP of interest to retarget any enveloped virus for both oncolytic and gene therapy purposes. © 2017","cystine knot protein; integrin; knottin; measles virus; oncolytic virus",Article,Scopus

Despite the advances in diagnostic imaging, microneurosurgical techniques, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, significant increases in the progression free survival of glioma patients have not been achieved. Improvements in our understanding of the molecular subtypes of gliomas and the underlying alterations in specific signaling pathways may impact both the diagnosis and the treatment strategies for patients with gliomas. Growth factors and their corresponding receptor tyrosine kinases are associated with oncogenesis and development of tumors in numerous human cancer types, including glioma. Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains (LRIG) are integral membrane proteins which contain three vertebrate members including LRIG1, LRIG2 and LRIG3. They mainly function as regulators of growth factor signaling. Specifically, LRIG1 has been identified as a tumor suppressor in human cancers. In contrast, LRIG2 appears to function as a tumor promoter, while LRIG3 appears to have a function similar to that of LRIG1.

Experimental design: Weperformed copy number, mutational state, and zygosity analysis of 151 genes in SCC arising in MCT (n = 25) using next-generation sequencing. The presence of high-/intermediate-risk HPV genotypes was assessed by quantitative PCR. Genomic events were correlated with clinical features and outcome. Results: MCT had a low mutation burden with a mean of only one mutation per case. Zygosity analyses of MCT indicated four separate patterns, suggesting that MCT can arise from errors at various stages of oogenesis. A total of 244 abnormalities were identified in 79 genes in MCT-associated SCC, and the overall mutational burdenwas high(mean 10.2mutations permegabase). No SCC was positive for HPV. The most frequently altered genes in SCC were TP53 (20/25 cases, 80%), PIK3CA (13/25 cases, 52%), andCDKN2A(11/25 cases, 44%).MutationinTP53was associated with improved overall survival.

Identifying and quantifying the movement of chemicals at the air-water interface are important steps in characterizing chemical fate. Superfund sites are often suspected sources of air pollution due to legacy sediment and water contamination. A quantitative assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oxygenated PAH (OPAHs) diffusive flux in a river system that contains a Superfund Mega-site, and passes through residential, urban and agricultural land, has not been reported before. Here, passive sampling devices (PSDs) were used to measure 60 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 22 oxygenated PAH (OPAHs) in air and water. From these concentrations the magnitude and direction of contaminant flux between these two compartments was calculated. The magnitude of PAH flux was greater at sites near or within the Superfund Mega-site than outside of the Superfund Mega-site. The largest net individual PAH deposition at a single site was naphthalene at a rate of − 14,200 (± 5780) (ng/m2)/day. The estimated one-year total flux of phenanthrene was − 7.9 × 105 (ng/m2)/year. Human health risk associated with inhalation of vapor phase PAHs and dermal exposure to PAHs in water were assessed by calculating benzo[a]pyrene equivalent concentrations. Excess lifetime cancer risk estimates show potential increased risk associated with exposure to PAHs at sites within and in close proximity to the Superfund Mega-site. Specifically, estimated excess lifetime cancer risk associated with dermal exposure and inhalation of PAHs was above 1 in 1 million within the Superfund Mega-site. The predominant depositional flux profile observed in this study suggests that the river water in this Superfund site is largely a sink for airborne PAHs, rather than a source. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Benzofluorenone; Benzo[c]fluorene; Environmental transport; Flux assessment; Marine fauna respiratory zone; Passive sampling",Article,Scopus

Besides, no obvious inhibitory effect on activation of STAT1 and STAT5 was observed with PMMB-187 treatment. Most notably, the in vivo studies further revealed that PMMB-187 could dramatically suppress the MDA-MB-231 cells xenografted tumor growth. The in vitro and in vivo results collectively suggest that PMMB-187 may serve as a promising lead compound for the further development of potential therapeutic anti-neoplastic agents. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Anti-neoplastic; Breast cancer; Shikonin; STAT3 inhibitors; Structural modifications",Article,Scopus

Consequent SAR and follow-up screening data led to the discovery of two potent PDK1 inhibitors: compound 32 and 35, with an IC50 of 80 nM and 94 nM, respectively. Further biological evaluation showed that, at the low nanomolar concentration, the drug had potent ability to inhibit phosphorylation of AKT and p70S6, and selectively kill the cancer cells with mutations in both PTEN and PI3K. The microarray data showed that DUSP6, DUSP4, and FOSL1 were down-regulated in the sensitive cell lines with the compound treatment.

Regardless of whether immunomodulation is intentional or not, it may result in adverse consequences. Molecules that downmodulate immune responses may protect against the adverse consequences of a disease, but they also have the potential to affect how the body protects itself against infection and malignancies by impairing immunosurveillance, while agents that stimulate the immune system to help fight infection or cancer can result in autoimmunity. The testing of a biopharmaceutical should include specialized evaluation of possible immunotoxicity based on an understanding of the type of biopharmaceutical (monoclonal antibody, fusion protein, recombinant human cytokine, etc.) and its expected mechanism of action. A battery of in vitro and in vivo tests for evaluating immunotoxicity is available, and knowledge of the target and type of biopharmaceutical is essential to determine an appropriate testing paradigm. Testing may include routine or specialized assays to assess general immune status that can be incorporated into required toxicology studies or stand-alone studies and targeted assays that assess specific components of immunity or immune function (e.g., susceptibility to infection or cancer). Regardless of the intended mechanism of action, an assessment of immunogenicity should always be included due to the possibility of the biopharmaceutical eliciting an immune response in animals and/or humans, which may result in safety concerns such as loss of activity or exposure, immune-complex disease, or neutralization of endogenous proteins. Characterizing the potential immunotoxicity of a biopharmaceutical is critical for understanding the potential risk to patients of immunotoxicities resulting from immunogenicity, immunosuppression, or immunostimulation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Autoimmunity; Biopharmaceutical; Immune function; Immunogenicity; Immunomodulator; Immunostimulation; Immunosuppression; Immunosurveillance; Immunotoxicity; Infections; Malignancies",Book Chapter,Scopus

While uterine leiomyomas are benign, they are the most common pelvic tumor and are the leading cause for hysterectomy in women. Thus, uterine tumors have a significant impact on women's health. The uterus is exquisitely sensitive to the ovarian steroid hormones estradiol and progesterone and is therefore a target tissue for endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Such chemicals occur almost ubiquitously in our environment and may have profound effects on normal uterine development and function. This article provides an overview of what is known about the effects of various classes of EDCs on the incidence of uterine tumors in animal models. The importance of choosing the correct animal model, particularly when using rodent models, is discussed. This article also summarizes the different types of uterine tumors that occur in women as well as findings from epidemiological studies that implicate EDCs in uterine tumor development. The development of various human uterine cell lines for in vitro studies has allowed the identification of the mechanisms of action of EDCs and how these chemicals interact with estrogen receptor to act as either estrogen agonists or antagonists. Discussion of the transgenerational effects of exposure to EDCs is also included. While it has been difficult to show a direct link between environmental exposure to EDCs and an increased incidence of uterine tumors in women, the use of in vivo animal models, cell culture systems, and limited epidemiological data suggests a causal relationship between the two. Future studies will undoubtedly lead to an increased understanding of the potential clinical importance of environmental toxicants in the uterus. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Adenocarcinoma; Arsenic; Cadmium; Dioxin; Endocrine disrupting chemical; Endometrial cancer; Estrogen agonist; Estrogen receptor; Leiomyoma; Leiomyosarcoma; Phthalates; Phytoestrogens; Uterine sarcoma; Xenoestrogen",Book Chapter,Scopus

Host-virus interactions are complex and modulated by a tumor microenvironment whose immunosuppressive activities can limit the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies. In an effort to improve this aspect of oncolytic virotherapy, we combined the oncolytic herpes virus HSV1716 with the transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 (TGF-βR1) inhibitor A8301 to treat syngeneic models of murine rhabdomyosarcoma. Mice that received HSV1716 or A8301 alone showed little to no benefit in efficacy and survival over controls. Conversely, mice given combination therapy exhibited tumor stabilization throughout the treatment regimen, which was reflected in significantly prolonged survival times including some complete responses. In vitro cell viability and virus replication assays showed that the rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines were generally insensitive to HSV1716 and A8301. Likewise, in vivo virus replication assays showed that HSV1716 titers moderately decreased in the presence of A8301. The enhanced efficacy instead appears to be dependent on the generation of an improved anti-tumor T cell response as determined by its loss in athymic nude mice and following in vivo depletion of either CD4+ or CD8+ cells. These data suggest TGF-β inhibition can augment the immunotherapeutic efficacy of oncolytic herpes virotherapy. © 2017 The Author(s)","childhood sarcoma; herpes virus; immunotherapy; oncolytic virotherapy; oncolytic virus; rhabdomyosarcoma; smad signaling; T cell; TGF-β",Article,Scopus

However, the underlying mechanisms connecting RUNX1 to the success of therapy remain elusive. Here we explore the hypothesis that RUNX1 is directly involved in the response of hematopoietic cells to cytotoxic agents. RUNX1 was upregulated posttranscriptionally by cytotoxic agents in C57BL/6 mice in vivo and hematopoietic cell lines. Upregulation was also seen in primary human AML cells after treatment with cytarabine in vitro. Upon overexpression, RUNX1 restricted proliferation, promoted apoptosis, and augmented the DNA damage response. This unknown activity of RUNX1 required an intact runt homology domain (RHD), a domain where most leukemia-associated point mutations cluster. Consistent with this, two RHDdefective RUNX1 proteins lacked any antiproliferative or apoptotic activity, and RHD-defective (K83N, N109D) mutant RUNX1 conferred resistance to ionizing radiation when overexpressed in Ba/F3 cells under certain conditions. Our experiments reveal a novel function of RUNX1 and offer an explanation for the link between RUNX1 mutations and chemotherapy and radiation resistance. Moreover, these data suggest that pharmacologic modulation of RUNX1 might be an attractive new approach to treat hematologic malignancies. © 2017 AACR.",,Article,Scopus

The revolutionary outcome of palbociclib in 2015 as CDK4/6 inhibitor added a new charm to the specific inhibitor design for CDKs. Computer-aided drug design (CADD) tools added a benefit to the design and development of new CDK inhibitors by studying the binding pattern of the inhibitors to the ATP binding domain of CDKs. Herein, we have attempted a comparative analysis of structural differences between several CDKs ATP binding sites and their inhibitor specificity by depicting the important ligand-receptor interactions for a particular CDK to be targeted.

This study was to prospectively, quantitatively, and mechanistically investigate the penetration of AZD1775 across the human blood-brain barrier (BBB). Experimental Design: AZD1775 plasma and tumor pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 20 patients with glioblastoma. The drug metabolism, transcellular passive permeability, and interactions with efflux and uptake transporters were determined using human derived in vitro systems. A whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model integrated with a fourcompartment permeability-limited brain model was developed for predicting the kinetics of AZD1775 BBB penetration and assessing the factors modulating this process. Results: AZD1775 exhibited good tumor penetration in patients with glioblastoma, with the unbound tumor-to-plasma concentration ratio ranging from 1.3 to 24.4 (median, 3.2). It was a substrate for ABCB1, ABCG2, and OATP1A2, but not for OATP2B1 or OAT3. AZD1775 transcellular passive permeability and active efflux clearance across MDCKII-ABCB1 or MDCKII-ABCG2 cell monolayers were dependent on the basolateral pH. The PBPK model well predicted observed drug plasma and tumor concentrations in patients. The extent and rate of drug BBB penetration were influenced by BBB integrity, efflux and uptake active transporter activity, and drug binding to brain tissue. Conclusions: In the relatively acidic tumor microenvironment where ABCB1/ABCG2 transporter-mediated efflux clearance is reduced, OATP1A2-mediated active uptake becomes dominant, driving AZD1775 penetration into brain tumor. Variations in the brain tumor regional pH, transporter expression/ activity, and BBB integrity collectively contribute to the heterogeneity of AZD1775 penetration into brain tumors. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",,Article,Scopus

We show that loss of THRAP3 and/or BCLAF1 leads to sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, defective DNA repair and genomic instability. Additionally, we demonstrate that this phenotype can be at least partially explained by the role of THRAP3 and BCLAF1 in the selective mRNA splicing and export of transcripts encoding key DDR proteins, including the ATM kinase. Moreover, we show that cancer associated mutations within THRAP3 result in deregulated processing of THRAP3/BCLAF1- regulated transcripts and consequently defective DNA repair.

Based on the revised 2009 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging system, a fusion of T2WI and DWI was utilized for the evaluation of invasion depth and determination of the overall stage. Postoperative pathologic assessment was considered as the reference standard. The consistency of T2WI image staging and pathologic staging, and the consistency of fused T2WI and DWI and pathologic staging were all analyzed using Kappa statistics. Results: Compared with the T2WI group, a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy was observed for myometrial invasion with fusion of T2WI and DWI (77.6% for T2WI; 94.8% for T2WI-DWI). For the identification of deep invasion, we calculated values for diagnostic sensitivity (69.2% for T2WI; 92.3% for T2WI-DWI), specificity (80% for T2WI; 95.6% for T2WI-DWI), positive predictive value (50% for T2WI; 85.7% for T2WI-DWI), and negative predictive value (90% for T2WI; 97.7% for T2WI-DWI). In summary, T2WI-DWI fusion exhibits higher diagnostic accuracy with respect to staging relative to T2WI only (81.0% for T2WI; 94.8% for T2WI-DWI). Conclusion: Fused T2WI-DWI may represent a noninvasive, lower cost approach for the effective assessment of myometrial invasion and staging of endometrial carcinoma. © 2017 Guo et al.","DWI; Endometrial carcinoma; Fusion; Magnetic resonance imaging; Myometrial invasion; Staging; T2WI",Article,Scopus

Evidence increasingly support the merits of model-based dose-finding designs in identifying the recommended phase II dose compared with conventional rule-based designs such as the 3+3 but despite this, their use remains limited. Here, we propose a useful tool, dose transition pathways (DTP), which helps overcome several commonly faced practical and methodologic challenges in the implementation of model-based designs. DTP projects in advance the doses recommended by a model-based design for subsequent patients (stay, escalate, deescalate, or stop early), using all the accumulated information. After specifying a model with favorable statistical properties, we utilize the DTP to fine-tune the model to tailor it to the trial's specific requirements that reflect important clinical judgments. In particular, it can help to determinehowstringent the stopping rules should be if the investigated therapy is too toxic. Its use to design and implement a modified continual reassessment method is illustrated in an acute myeloid leukemia trial. DTP removes the fears of model-based designs as unknown, complex systems and can serve as a handbook, guiding decision-making for each dose update. In the illustrated trial, the seamless, clear transitionfor each dose recommendation aided the investigators' understanding of the design and facilitated decision-making to enable finer calibration of a tailored model. We advocate the use of the DTP as an integral procedure in the co-development and successful implementation of practical model-based designs by statisticians and investigators. ©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",,Article,Scopus

Here we show that the cell type–restricted thyroid hormone receptor isoform TRb2 sensitizes to RB1 loss in both settings by antagonizing the widely expressed and tumor-suppressive TRb1. TRb2 promoted expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SKP2, a critical factor for RB1-mutant tumors, by enabling EMI1/FBXO5–dependent inhibition of SKP2 degradation. In RB1 wild-type neuroblastoma cells, endogenous Rb or ectopic TRb2 was required to sustain SKP2 expression as well as cell viability and proliferation. These results suggest that in certain contexts, Rb loss enables TRb1-dependent suppression of SKP2 as a safeguard against RB1-deficient tumorigenesis.

However, various obstacles limit T-cell efficacy, including suboptimal T-cell receptor (TCR) activation and an immunosuppressive tumor environment. Here, we developed a fusion protein by linking CD8α and MyD88 (CD8α: MyD88) to enhance CD8+ T-cell responses to weakly immunogenic and poorly expressed tumor antigens. CD8α: MyD88-engineered T cells exhibited increased proliferation and expression of effector and costimulatory molecules in a tumor antigen-dependent manner. These effects were accompanied by elevated activation of TCR and Toll-like receptor signaling-related proteins. CD8α: MyD88-expressing T cells improved antitumor responses in mice. Enhanced antitumor activity was associated with a unique tumor cytokine/chemokine signature, improved T-cell infiltration, reduced markers of T-cell exhaustion, elevated levels of proteins associated with antigen presentation, and fewer macrophages with an immunosuppressive phenotype in tumors.

Dysregulation of IGF pathway contributes to the initiation, progression and metastasis of cancer and is also involved in diseases of glucose metabolism, such as diabetes. We have identified Ubiquilin1 (UBQLN1) as a novel interaction partner of IGF1R, IGF2R and insulin receptor (INSR). UBQLN family of proteins have been studied primarily in the context of protein quality control and in the field of neurodegenerative disorders. Our laboratory discovered a link between UBQLN1 function and tumorigenesis, such that UBQLN1 is lost and underexpressed in 50% of human lung adenocarcinoma cases. We demonstrate here that UBQLN1 regulates the expression and activity of IGF1R. Following loss of UBQLN1 in lung adenocarcinoma cells, there is accelerated loss of IGF1R. Despite decreased levels of total receptors, the ratio of active : Total receptors is higher in cells that lack UBQLN1. UBQLN1 also regulates INSR and IGF2R post-stimulation with ligand. We conclude that UBQLN1 is essential for normal regulation of IGF receptors. UBQLN-1-deficient cells demonstrate increased cell viability compared with control when serum-starved and stimulation of IGF pathway in these cells increased their migratory potential by 3-fold. As the IGF pathway is involved in processes of normal growth, development, metabolism and cancer progression, understanding its regulation by Ubiquilin1 can be of tremendous value to many disciplines. © 2017 The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) is a protein receptor mainly expressed in activated T cells and regulatory T cells. CTLA-4 competes with CD28 for ligand binding and generates inhibitory signals to attenuate T cell activation. The blockade of CTLA-4 mediated immune inhibitory checkpoint has been associated with enhanced anti-tumor immunity. In this study, we use CRISPR-Cas9 system to knock out (KO) CTLA-4 from cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and evaluate its effect on the anti-tumor activity of the CTLs. CTLA-4 KO CTLs robustly enhanced tumor cell death by 40% compared to the control and facilitated apoptosis and caspase activities in tumor cells. The knockout of CTLA-4 also increased TNF-α and IFN-γ secretion of the CTLs by approximately 2-fold. The effectiveness of CTLA-4 KO in enhancing anti-tumor activity of the CTLs was verified in vivo using mouse xenograft model. The xenografted mice treated with CTLA-4 KO CTLs demonstrated repressed tumor growth and prolonged survival compared to the control group.

Methods: Mastectomized patients with CIS (n = 104) were retrospectively selected. Clinicopathology and preoperative mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were analyzed. Results: Histopathological NAC-positivity was confirmed in 20 (19.2%) patients. Short nipple-tumor distance and suspicious extension to the nipple by mammography were significant but ultrasound was not significant to predict NAC involvement. NAC-positive cases had MRI findings of shorter nipple-tumor distance in both the early and delayed phases. Multivariable regression model showed age >50 years and shorter tumor-nipple distance on the delay phase of MRI were statistically significant predictors of NAC involvement. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was 0.618 when calculated by CancerMath; however, an AUC of 0.954 was achieved when distance and age were applied together as predictor. Conclusions: Mammographic and MRI findings were significant for predicting NAC involvement, with distance of the tumor from the nipple in delay phase MRI the most significant predictor of NAC involvement.

It becomes significantly inactive (non-toxic) when derivatized at its N-2′ secondary amine. This provides a strategy for targeting emetine to cancerous tumor without killing normal cells. In this report, PSA activatable peptide prodrugs of emetine were synthesized. To overcome steric hindrances and enhance protease specific cleavage, a 2-stage prodrug activation process was needed to release emetine in cancer cells. In this 2-stage process, emetine prodrug intermediates are coupled to PSA peptide substrate (Ac-His-Ser-Ser-Lys-Leu-Gln) to obtain the full prodrug. Both prodrug intermediates 10 (Ala-Pro-PABC-Emetine) and 14 (Ser-Leu-PABC-Emetine) were evaluated for kinetics of hydrolysis to emetine and potency [Where PABC = p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl]. While both intermediates quantitatively liberate emetine when incubated under appropriate conditions, upon coupling of PSA substrate to give the full prodrugs, only prodrug 16, the prodrug obtained from 14 was hydrolyzable by PSA. Cytotoxicity studies in PSA producing LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 confirm the activation of the prodrug by PSA with an IC50 of 75 nM and 59 nM respectively. The cytotoxicity of 16 is significantly reduced in cell lines that do not produce PSA. Further, in vivo toxicity studies are done on these prodrugs and other derivatives of emetine. The results show the significance of conformational modulation in obtaining safe emetine prodrugs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Anticancer prodrugs; Emetine; Emetine derivatives; Emetine-prodrugs; Prostate cancer; Prostate specific antigen (PSA)",Article,Scopus

Many USPs have been linked to critical axes for therapeutic intervention, and the finding that USP28 is required for c-Myc stability suggests that USP28 inhibition may represent a novel approach to targeting this so far undruggable oncogene. Here, we describe the discovery of the first reported inhibitors of USP28, which we demonstrate are able to bind to and inhibit USP28, and while displaying a dual activity against the closest homologue USP25, these inhibitors show a high degree of selectivity over other deubiquitinases (DUBs). The utility of these compounds as valuable probes to investigate and further explore cellular DUB biology is highlighted by the demonstration of target engagement against both USP25 and USP28 in cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these inhibitors are able to elicit modulation of both the total levels and the half-life of the c-Myc oncoprotein in cells and also induce apoptosis and loss of cell viability in a range of cancer cell lines. We however observed a narrow therapeutic index compared to a panel of tissue-matched normal cell lines. Thus, it is hoped that these probes and data presented herein will further advance our understanding of the biology and tractability of DUBs as potential future therapeutic targets. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,Article,Scopus

The prognosis of the patients with glioma is poor regardless of the development of therapeutic strategies. Its aggressive behavior mainly depends on the potent ability of proliferation. The transcription factor EGR1 (early growth response 1) is a member of a zinc finger transcription factor family which plays an essential role in cell growth and proliferation. Methods: EGR1 expression levels in 39 glioma tissues and 10 normal brain tissues were tested by RT-qPCR and Western-blotting. The effects of EGR1 on U251 cells, U251 stem-like cells (GSCs), and U87 cells proliferation were assessed using in vitro and in vivo cell proliferation assays. The specific binding between EGR1 and CCND1 promoter was confirmed by CHIP assay. EGF was used to improve EGR1 expression in this assay. Results: EGR1 expression levels in human gliomas are decreased compared with normal brain tissues, however, the patients with low EGR1 expression level showed significantly enhanced patient survival in all glioma patients. EGR1 silencing inhibited proliferation and induced G1 phase arrest in glioma cells. EGR1 contributed to proliferation by directly raising CCND1. Meanwhile, EGR1 overexpression induced by EGF was able to promote the proliferation of glioma cells. Conclusions: Our results show that stable knockdown EGR1 would inhibit glioma proliferation. The results suggest EGR1 showing lower expression in cancer tissues compared with normal tissues maybe still play an important role in tumor proliferation. © 2017 The Author(s).","CCND1; EGR1; Glioma; Proliferation",Article,Scopus

Methods: The early and late regeneration indexes were defined as the relative increase in liver volume (RLV) within 2 and 9 months from surgery. Regeneration rates of the preoperative treatment groups were compared. Results: Preoperative chemotherapy details and volumetric data were available for 185 patients; 78 (42.2%) received preoperative chemotherapy with bevacizumab (Bev+), 46 (24.8%) received chemotherapy only (Bev−), and 61 (33%) received no chemotherapy. Patients in the Bev+ and Bev− groups received similar chemotherapy cycles (4 [3-6] vs 4 [4-6]; P = 0.499). Despite the comparable clinicopathological characteristics and Resected Volume/Total Liver Volume (TLV) at surgery (P = 0.944) of both groups, Bev+ group had higher early and late regeneration (17.2% vs 4.3%; P = 0.035 and 14.0% vs 9.4%; P = 0.091, respectively). Of note, early and late regeneration rates (3.7% and 10.9% vs 6.6% and 5.5%, respectively) were comparable between the no chemotherapy and Bev− groups (all P > 0.05). In multivariable analysis —adjusted for gender, age, portal vein embolization, preoperative chemotherapy, resected liver volume, tumor number, postoperative chemotherapy, fibrosis, steatosis— bevacizumab independently predicted early liver regeneration (P = 0.019). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that preoperative bevacizumab administered along with chemotherapy was associated with enhanced volumetric restoration. Interestingly, this effect was more pronounced among patients who received oxaliplatin-based regimens and bevacizumab compared to those treated with irinotecan-based regimens and bevacizumab. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","bevacizumab; liver resection; regeneration",Article,Scopus

Unfortunately, in addition to their beneficial properties, pesticides can have undesirable consequences as well. They differ from any other chemical substance as they are deliberately spread into the environment, and, since are designed to interfere with certain living species, variable levels of toxicity inevitably characterize them. By their nature, pesticides are potentially toxic to other organisms, including humans, and need to be used safely and disposed of properly. These side effects are due to the fact that the majority of pesticides targeting processes that are important for normal cell function they can have detrimental effects on humans and on the ecosystem.

The positive aspects of immunity, which include defenses against infections and cancers, as well as the negative aspects, including different hypersensitivities that can lead to pathophysiological conditions and autoimmune diseases, are described. Mechanisms to circumvent immune responses to self-constituents via tolerogenic processes (processes that prevent responses to antigens) are contrasted with immunogenic responses (immunity to antigens).

However, beyond the modulation of the canonical PI3K pathway, the consequences of inhibiting PI3Kb are poorly defined. Experimental Design: To determine the broader impact of AZD8186 in PTEN-null tumors, we performed a genome-wide RNA-seq analysis of PTEN-null triple-negative breast tumor xenografts treated with AZD8186. Mechanistic consequences of AZD8186 treatment were examined across a number of PTENnull cell lines and tumor models. Results: AZD8186 treatment resulted in modification of transcript and protein biomarkers associated with cell metabolism. We observed downregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes and upregulation of markers associated with metabolic stress. Downregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis proteins, such as HMGCS1, occurred in PTEN-null cell lines and tumor xenografts sensitive to AZD8186. Therapeutic inhibition of PI3Kβ also upregulated PDHK4 and increased PDH phosphorylation, indicative of reduced carbon flux into the TCA cycle. Consistent with this, metabolomic analysis revealed a number of changes in key carbon pathways, nucleotide, and amino acid biosynthesis. Conclusions: This study identifies novel mechanistic biomarkers of PI3Kβ inhibition in PTEN-null tumors supporting the concept that targeting PI3Kb may exploit a metabolic dependency that contributes to therapeutic benefit in inducing cell stress.

In this report, we investigated the role of CD103 cytoplasmic domain and the focal adhesion-associated protein paxillin (Pxn) in downstream signaling and functional activities triggered through αE/CD103 chain. Binding to immobilized recombinant (r)E-cadherin-Fc of CD103 integrin expressed on tumor-specific CTL clones promotes phosphorylation of Pxn and Pyk2 and binding of Pxn to the αE/CD103 subunit tail. Inhibition of Pxn phosphorylation by the Src inhibitor saracatinib or its knockdown via shRNA dramatically altered adhesion and spreading of freshly isolated CD8+/CD103+ lung tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes and CD103+ tumor-specific CTL clones. Inhibition of Pxn phosphorylation with saracatinib in these CTL clones also severely compromised their functional activities toward autologous tumor cells.

A direct comparison of CYP3A4 activity gave an eightfold higher space-time yield for enzyme bag-catalyzed biotransformation as compared to whole-cell biotransformation, even though the total number of cells employed was lower by a factor of 150. Biotransformation of the luminogenic substrate Luciferin-H using CYP2C9-containing enzyme bags proceeded efficiently and stably for 24 h. CYP4Z1 is of interest because it is strongly overexpressed both in breast cancer cells and in breast cancer metastases; however, current knowledge about its catalytic properties is very limited. Screening of CYP4Z1-containing enzyme bags with 15 luminogenic substrates enabled us to identify two new hydroxylations and eleven ether cleavage reactions that are catalyzed by CYP4Z1. By far the best substrate found in this study was Luciferin benzyl ether (Luciferin-BE). On the basis of the recently published crystal structure of CYP4B1 we created a new homology model of CYP4Z1 and performed molecular docking experiments, which indicate that all active substrates show a highly similar binding geometry compared to the endogenous substrates. The model predicts that Ser113, Ser222, Asn381, and Ser383 are key hydrogen bonding residues. We also identified five new inhibitors of CYP4Z1: miconazole, econazole, aminobenzotriazole, tolazoline, and 1-benzylimidazole respectively, with the last compound being the most potent giving an IC50 value of 180 nM in our test system. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Biotransformation; Ether cleavage; Fission yeast; Human cytochrome P450; Hydroxylation",Article,Scopus

One challenge associated with genome classification is feature selection; which genes can be used for phenotyping. This challenge is made more complicated considering affected gene mutate at different rates and schedules. In addition, the number of genes and consequently the number of base pairs cause genome classification to suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Some previous classification efforts rely on variant detection for feature selection. Variant detection aligns a target genome to a reference genome in order to identify the variations between the two. Other methods are sequence-based, which involve generating features from base pairs of genome sequences. This paper details a sequence-based methodology developed using k-length subsets of the genome sequence, k-mers, as features for phenotype classification. As a result of the methodology introduced here, we remedied challenges associated with high-dimensional data and improved phenotype classification performance using sequence-based classification. © 2017 IEEE.","compressive sampling; compressive sensing; genome classification; phenotype classification",Conference Paper,Scopus

Inhalation exposure becomes critical when one considers that the mammalian respiratory system must not only maintain life by the exchange of gases but also perform a number of essential nonrespiratory functions such as the maintenance of an active immune system, metabolism of biologically active substances, and the clearance of viable and nonviable particles from the lung.

The process of embryo implantation involves a complex series of molecular dialogues between the embryo and the uterus. Estrogen plays an essential role for the onset of embryo-uterine interactions during implantation and involves molecular interplay of numerous growth and differentiation regulating signaling molecules, but the hierarchical molecular relationships downstream of estrogen signaling remain poorly understood. It is well established that any aberration of normal signaling by estrogenic mimics (xenoestrogens) poses a major threat to the process of implantation and therefore the pregnancy outcome. In this review, we highlight our current knowledge about estrogen (or its mimics) regulated molecular events in implantation and in general uterine signaling, and the future challenges of the field. Basic understanding of estrogen-mediated signaling mechanisms during the onset of implantation will help alleviate problems of infertility, develop novel contraceptives, and to better manage uterine cancer problems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Cyclic adenosine monophosphate; Estrogen receptor; Gene knockout; Implantation; Protein kinase A; Uterine",Book Chapter,Scopus

However, the survival of most normal blood cells and other cell types is also dependent on Mcl-1. Despite the requirement for MCL-1 in these cell types, initial reports of MCL-1-specific BH3- mimetics have not described any overt toxicities associated with single-agent use, but these agents are still early in clinical development. Therefore, we sought to identify approved drugs that could sensitize leukemic cells to ABT-263. Experimental Design: A screen identified dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a water-soluble metabolite of the antimalarial artemisinin. Using mouse and human leukemic cell lines, and primary patient-derived xenografts, the effect of DHA on survival was tested, and mechanistic studies were carried out to discover how DHA functions. We further tested in vitro and in vivo whether combining DHA with ABT-263 could enhance the response of leukemic cells to combination therapy. Results: DHA causes the downmodulation of MCL-1 expression by triggering a cellular stress response that represses translation. The repression of MCL-1 renders leukemic cells highly sensitive to synergistic cell death induced by ABT-263 in a mouse model of BCR-ABL+ B-ALL both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, DHA synergizes with ABT-263 in human Ph+ ALL cell lines, and primary patient-derived xenografts of Ph+ ALL in culture. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that combining DHA with ABT-263 can improve therapeutic response in BCR-ABL+ B-ALL. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",,Article,Scopus

In this report, we explored the contribution of intracellular components of Smad-mediated BMP signal transduction using the same model. Interestingly, upon DSS treatment, we noticed an overexpression of Runx1/2/3 transcription factors in both wild-type and uPA-deficient mice. Moreover, Runx1 and Runx2 expression levels exhibited an even higher increase in DSS-treated/uPA-deficient mice as compared to DSS-treated/wild-type animals. In all experimental conditions, in situ investigation of Runx-expressing cell types, revealed detection of all three Runx in the immune cells, yet in the DSS-treated/uPA-deficient mice Runx1 and Runx2 were also identified in the preneoplastic epithelium of advanced high-grade dysplasia and carcinoma in-situ colonic lesions. Finally, the uPA-deficient pro-tumorigenic colitic microenvironment exhibited increased levels of the Runx-induced target genes Snai2, Bim and Claudin1, known to have a role in tumor development and progression. These findings suggest that the absence of uPA correlates with increased levels of Runx transcriptional regulators in a way that promotes inflammation-associated carcinogenesis. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP); Colorectal cancer (CRC); Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS); Mouse model; Runx; Smad",Article,Scopus

In order to assess the performance of R-PathCluster, we conducted experiments with several clustering methods such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, and RBM models with different input data. R-PathCluster showed the best performance in clustering long-term and short-term survivals, although its clustering score was not the highest among them in experiments. R-PathCluster provides a solution to interpret the model in biological sense, since it takes pathway markers that represent biological process of pathways.

Methods: Two-hundred ninety-two patients who previously underwent radical prostatectomy were retrospectively selected for a case-control study, excluding those with anastomotic strictures and significant perioperative complications and re-called for a medical follow-up visit after their consent to participate the study. They were divided in 3 different groups according to the surgical technique previously received: radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) combined with bladder neck preservation (BNP), RARP with bladder neck resection, and RARP combined with BNP and posterior musculofascial reconstruction (PRec). Functional and oncologic outcomes evaluation were integrated by a questionnaire on urinary continence status, abdominal ultrasound scan, uroflowmetry and post-void urine volume measurement. Urinary continence definition included the terms ""no pad"" or ""safety pad"". Results: Two hundred thirty-two patients responded to the phone call interview and were enrolled in the study.

In addition, certain populations could be more susceptible to particular types of man-made chemicals due to genetic polymorphisms. The advancement of transgenic technology in mice over the past decade has brought the field of reproductive toxicology to a critical crossroad. These genetic models create unique opportunities for reproductive toxicologists to explore questions that could never before be imagined. To take full advantage of the power of these genetic models, a basic understanding of both female reproduction and the strengths and limitations of the genetic models is necessary. It is hoped that this article will trigger interest in and promote better use of transgenic mouse models in female reproductive toxicology. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Androgen receptors; Animal models; Aryl hydrocarbon receptors; Cyclooxygenase; Endocrine disruptors; Estrogen receptors; Female development; Female reproduction; Follicle-stimulating hormone receptors; Knockout; Luteinizing hormone receptors; Ovary; Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors; Progesterone receptors; Prolactin receptors; Prostaglandin receptors; Reproductive tract; Steroidogenesis; Transforming growth factor-beta superfamily receptors; Transgenic mice",Book Chapter,Scopus

The structures and regulatory aspects of the genes encoding the canonical enzymes are as well understood as any. Their involvement in the biotransformation of many endogenous and xenobiotic electrophiles is well understood at the enzymological level. High-resolution three-dimensional structures of numerous isoenzymes are known from which the molecular details of catalysis can be inferred and tested with enzymological techniques. The structures also provide the basis for the design of isoenzyme-specific inhibitors and even prodrugs that may ultimately be useful in a clinical setting. The GSH transferases have provided a physical and theoretical scaffold on which to explore techniques for the design or identification of enzymes with novel substrate specificities and increased activity. Recent studies have revealed novel roles for the GSH transferases in the metabolism of endogenous substrates and in the regulation of cell signaling pathways. Further understanding of the biological effects of their involvement in biotransformations will allow the full weight of the structural and mechanistic insights to be brought to bear on designing clinically and environmentally useful compounds. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Alternate splicing; Cancer; Chemotherapeutics; Detoxication; Drugs; Electrophiles; Enzyme inhibitors; Enzyme structure; Epoxides; Gene regulation; Glutathione; Haloalkanes; Metabolic activation; Metabolism; Microsomal glutathione transferase; Polymorphisms; Protein superfamilies; Xenobiotics",Book Chapter,Scopus

Over the past 20 years, ligand-activated nuclear receptors (NRs) have been established as important regulators of the numerous biotransformation enzymes and drug transporters. In this manner, NRs orchestrate a response of a body to xenobiotic exposure and a toxic injury.Several cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A1, 19A1, 11A1, 3A4/5/7, and 2J2) are expressed in placental trophoblast in different stages of pregnancy, although only few of them have functional catalytic activity to metabolize xenobiotics. ABC efflux transporters, MDR1/P-glycoprotein or breast cancer resistance protein, are highly expressed in the placenta and are important contributors to so-called placental barrier which protects the fetus against the xenobiotics.In this chapter, we summarize our current understanding of ligand-activated transcription factors and NRs in the human placenta in the regulation of placental metabolism, transport, and detoxification of xenobiotics. In addition, we discuss the issue whether the human placenta possesses molecular mechanism based on NR-mediated regulation of gene expression to dynamically respond to toxic exposure of the mother to protect the developing fetus. In particular, we comment roles of glucocorticoid receptor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, vitamin D, pregnane X, and constitutive androstane NRs in the human placenta. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","AhR; Barrier; BCRP; Cytochrome P450; Glucocorticoid receptor; Materno-fetal exchange; Nuclear receptors; P-glycoprotein; Placenta; PXR; Trophoblast; VDR",Book Chapter,Scopus

The strategy, which combined in situ sugar nucleotides generation with HA chain polymerization, could convert cheap monosaccharides into HA polymers without consuming exogenous sugar nucleotide donors. HA polymers (number-average molecular weight ranged from 1.5 × 104 to 5.5 × 105 Da) with over 70% yields were efficiently synthesized and purified from this one-pot system.

As the understanding of B-cell development has evolved, so has the appreciation of the multiple roles B cells assume not only as antibody-producing cells, but also as cytokine secreting, and antigen-presenting cells. In this article we address several fundamental issues surrounding B-cell development and function by starting with the basic hypotheses underlying our understanding of B-cell biology and the B-cell receptor. We highlight the mechanisms controlling the development of B-lineage progenitors up to the fate of newly formed (NF) B cells and include a description of how self-reactive, and therefore potentially dangerous cells, are negatively regulated, and how B cells are positively selected to enter one of several functionally distinct B-cell subpopulations. Subsequently, we address the impact of failing to properly regulate the B-cell development and how the dysregulation underlies pathologies from genetically driven immunodeficiency to autoimmunity to cancer.

Regardless of their intended use, substances defined as drugs of abuse share the trait that they are addictive; that is, the user craves the substance, increasing the likelihood of continued substance use regardless of the consequences. One health consequence of illicit drug use is compromised immunity. There is a risk of increased susceptibility to various infections in user populations, especially those with compromised immune status, such as cancer or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients. This article describes the effects and mechanisms by which drugs of abuse produce immunotoxicity, including opioids, cocaine, cannabinoids, nicotine, alcohol, methamphetamine, and benzodiazepines. A primary focus is on psychotropic substances that produce peripheral immune suppression; however, brief descriptions of the mechanisms by which the substances produce their psychotropic effects are presented, as is the possibility of neuroinflammation following drug use. Also included are sections describing neuroimmune interactions as possible mechanisms for immune suppression, the effects of tolerance and withdrawal using opioids as the example, evidence that illicit drug use accelerates human immunodeficiency virus disease progression, and studies examining the possibility of a genetic contribution to immune compromise by opioids and cannabinoids. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Drugs of abuse; Immunotoxicology",Book Chapter,Scopus

The PET scan performed within the second h?spitalization (and before the second operation) did not detect the presence of any cutaneous metastases, which were clinically and histologically verified after the second operative procedure. CONCLUSIONS: This data suggests that shortly more reliable and sensitive imaging methods for monitoring patients with cutaneous melanoma should be found. Having in mind that our patient has been operated twice in the area of the primary lesion (as the surgical wound underwent secondary healing), theoretically, the abundant cicatrization could have led to reduced glucose uptake in the surrounded cancerous tissue.

The off-site risk to the public of XAPR's radioactivity release was preliminarily analyzed in application of probabilistic safety assessment at 100m point of XAPR boundary in radioactivity. The results demonstrate that the conditional probabilities of effective dose exceeding 1 mSv and 10 mSv are about 0.652% and 0.0750% respectively in the case of radioactivity release spectrum. The overall frequencies with which individual effective dose 10mSv is exceeded is less than 2.20×10 -9 a -1 , meanwhile the other overall frequency with which individual cancer fatality risk is exceeded is not greater than 1.89×10 -6 a -1 .

Due to some extraordinary catastrophic events and/or the aging of these products, people's health and environmental risk associated with the inhalation of asbestos fibers keeps being high even in those countries where it was banned. For these reasons, many communities are developing plans for an environmental and sanitary safe asbestos removal and management.

SVs have been shown to play important roles in multiple diseases, including cancer. As costs for NGS continue to decline and variant databases become ever more complete, the relevance of genotyping also SVs from NGS data increases steadily, which is in stark contrast to the lack of tools to do so.Results: We introduce a novel statistical approach, called DIGTYPER (Duplication and Inversion GenoTYPER), which computes genotype likelihoods for a given inversion or duplication and reports the maximum likelihood genotype. In contrast to purely coverage-based approaches, DIGTYPER uses breakpoint-spanning read pairs as well as split alignments for genotyping, enabling typing also of small events. We tested our approach on simulated and on real data and compared the genotype predictions to those made by DELLY, which discovers SVs and computes genotypes, and SVTyper, a genotyping program used to genotype variants detected by LUMPY. DIGTYPER compares favorable especially for duplications (of all lengths) and for shorter inversions (up to 300 bp). In contrast to DELLY, our approach can genotype SVs from data bases without having to rediscover them.Availability and Implementation: https://bitbucket.org/jana_ebler/digtyper.git.Contact: t.marschall@mpi-inf.mpg.de.Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. © The Author 2017.

Early and accurate diagnosis of tumor grading is the key for subsequent therapy and treatment. In the past, conventional computer-aided diagnosis relies on handcrafted features from magnetic resonance images (MRI), which are usually inaccurate and laborious. Recently, deep neural networks have been developed and applied for tumor segmentation and classification. However, most existing methods consider 3D MRI as a series of 2D images and use a simple modality fusion method via feature concatenation. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D CNN) with gated multimodal unit (GMU) fusion to integrate the information both in three dimensions and in multiple modalities. Specifically, 3D convolutional kernels are directly applied to the whole MRI images, gathering the abnormalities in sagittal, axial and coronal directions. GMU with hidden states is proposed to fuse the information of multiple MRI modalities in both feature and decision level. Based on these, privilege information extracted by GMU fusion model is utilized to train a novel network called distilled-CNN, which significantly improves the performance of classification using single modality. Empirical studies on BRATS datasets corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed 3D CNN with GMU fusion and distilled-CNN to distinguish benign gliomas and malignant gliomas. © 2017 IEEE.","3D CNN; Brain tumor; MRI; Multimodal fusion; Privileged learning",Conference Paper,Scopus

Understanding the precise mechanisms of microRNA-mRNA interaction is fundamentally important to elucidate the important roles of miRNA in regulating various cellular and disease developmental stages. Numerous computational methods have been developed for miRNA target prediction, mostly focusing on static binding prediction and highly dependent on sequence-pairing interactions. However, the interplay between competing and cooperative microRNA-target binding makes it exceptionally complex and challenging for reliable target identification, which has hindered the existing tools from practical use. In this study, we present a new computational method for microRNA target prediction using the Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DPGMM). A comprehensive collection of features related to sequence and structure of microRNAs, mRNAs, and the binding sites have been assessed to optimize the statistical prediction of new binding sites in human transcriptome. Through multiple evaluations on recently-discovered miRNA-mRNA interactions reported in large-scale sequencing analyses and a screening test on the entire human transcripts, the results show that our model outperformed several state-of-the-art tools in terms of reduced false positive prediction and promising predictive power on binding sites specific to transcript isoforms. © 2017 IEEE.","Bayesian inference; Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture; Machine learning; MicroRNA; MicroRNA target prediction",Conference Paper,Scopus

Yet for malignancies of the brain, direct intratumoral infusion of VSVΔ51 causes lethal virus-induced neuropathology. Here, we have developed a novel therapeutic regime that uses peripheral immunization with a single sub-lethal dose of VSVΔ51 to establish an acute anti-viral state that enables the safe intracranial (IC) infusion of an otherwise lethal dose of VSVΔ51 within just 6 hr. Although type I interferons alone appeared insufficient to explain this protective phenotype, serum isolated at early time points from primed animals conferred protection against an IC dose of virus. Adaptive immune populations had minimal contributions. Finally, the therapeutic utility of this novel strategy was demonstrated by peripherally priming and intracranially treating mice bearing aggressive CT2A syngeneic astrocytomas with VSVΔ51. Approximately 25% of animals achieved complete regression of established tumors, with no signs of virus-induced neurological impairment. This approach may harness an early warning system in the brain that has evolved to protect the host against otherwise lethal neurotropic viral infections. We have exploited this protective mechanism to safely and efficaciously treat brain tumors with an otherwise neurotoxic virus, potentially widening the available treatment options for oncolytic virotherapy in the brain. © 2017 The Authors","brain; cancer; glioma; innate immunity; neuroimmunology; oncolytic; virus",Article,Scopus

We observed amplification of Melan-A-specific Vß subfamilies undetectable before therapy (thereafter called emerging Vß subfamilies) in responding patients, with a predominant expansion in patients with a complete response. These emerging Vß subfamilies displayed a higher functional avidity for their cognate antigen than Vß subfamilies not amplified upon anti-PD-1 therapy and could be identified by a sustained coexpression of PD-1 and TIGIT receptors.

The body's ability to remain healthy, despite constant exposure to xenobiotics, depends in part on the GI tract serving as a protective barrier. The primary component of this barrier is a single layer of cells, which consists predominantly of absorptive columnar epithelial cells or enterocytes. The enterocytes are replete with biotransformation enzymes and transport proteins that generally act to minimize, or even preclude, the body's exposure to xenobiotics. Biotransformation enzymes can be categorized as phase I or phase II enzymes. Phase I enzymes consist largely of the cytochromes P450 (CYPs), which either introduce or expose a functional group on the substrate, generally resulting in a small increase in hydrophilicity. Phase II enzymes conjugate organic donor molecules to the substrate, often a CYP-mediated metabolite, and generally result in detoxification and enhanced hydrophilicity, facilitating excretion from the body. Transport proteins belong to either the ATP-binding cassette or solute carrier superfamilies and are expressed on both the apical (brush border or mucosal) and basolateral (serosal) membrane of enterocytes. As such, these proteins function to facilitate the absorption of xenobiotics from the GI lumen into enterocytes or from enterocytes into the portal circulation, or to facilitate the exsorption of xenobiotics from enterocytes back into the GI lumen. Refinement of intestinal cell and tissue models, identification of appropriate animal models, and the increased availability of high-quality human-derived tissue enable a comprehensive characterization of GI biotransformation enzymes and transport proteins, including their roles in xenobiotic disposition and toxicity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Biotransformation enzymes; Breast cancer resistance protein; Concentrative nucleoside transporters; Cytochromes P450; Equilibrative nucleoside transporters; GI tract; Glutathione S-transferases; Monocarboxylate transporter; Multidrug resistance-associated proteins; Organic anion transporting polypeptides; Organic cation transporters; P-glycoprotein; Sulfotransferases; Transport proteins; UDP-glucuronosyltransferases",Book Chapter,Scopus

Expression of B18R by SFV4B18RmiRT aided neutralization of IFN-β which was shown by reduced STAT-1 phosphorylation and improved virus spread in plaque assays. B18R expression by SFV4 increased its oncolytic capacity in vitro against murine glioblastoma (CT-2A), regardless of the presence of exogenous IFN-β.

However, treatment with SFV4B18RmiRT induced severe neurological symptoms in some mice because of virus replication in the healthy brain. Neither neurotoxicity nor virus replication in the brain was observed when SFV4miRT was administered.

We reported that inhibition of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) leads to the suppression of replication-incompetent Ad vector-mediated hepatotoxicity via reduction of the leaky expression of Ad genes in liver. Here, to develop a TRAD with an improved safety profile, we designed a TRAD that carries a liver-specific promoter-driven dominant-negative IκBα (DNIκBα) expression cassette (TRAD-DNIκBα). Compared with a conventional TRAD, TRAD-DNIκBα showed hepatocyte-specific inhibition of NF-κB signaling and significantly reduced Ad gene expression and replication in the normal human hepatocyte cell line. TRAD-induced hepatotoxicity was largely suppressed in mice following intravenous administration of TRAD-DNIκBα.

It is essential for viral vectors to possess no adventitious mutations and no (antibiotic) selection marker in the final product for human patients in order to comply with the guidance from the regulatory agencies. Rintoul et al. have previously developed a selectable and excisable marker (SEM) system for the rapid generation of recombinant vaccinia virus. In the current study, we describe an improved methodology for rapid creation and selection of recombinant poxviruses with multiple genetic manipulations solely based on expression of a fluorescent protein and with no requirement for drug selection that can lead to cellular stress and the risk of adventitious mutations throughout the viral genome. Using this improved procedure combined with the SEM system, we have constructed multiple marker-free oncolytic poxviruses expressing different cytokines and other therapeutic genes. The high fidelity of inserted DNA sequences validates the utility of this improved procedure for generation of therapeutic viruses for human patients. We have created an oncolytic poxvirus expressing human chemokine CCL5, designated as vvDD-A34R-hCCL5, with manipulations at two genetic loci in a single virus. Finally, we have produced and purified this virus in clinical grade for its use in a phase I clinical trial and presented data on initial in vitro characterization of the virus. © 2017 The Author(s)","cancer; clinical grade; immunotherapy; marker-free poxvirus; method; oncolytic virus; vaccine; vaccinia virus",Article,Scopus

The challenge is to safely target oncolytic viruses to tumors. Previously, we have generated influenza A viruses (IAVs) containing deletions in the viral interferon antagonist. Those deletions have attenuated the virus in normal tissue but allowed replication in tumor cells. IAV entry is mediated by hemagglutinin (HA), which needs to be activated by a serine protease, for example, through trypsin. To further target the IAV to tumors, we have changed the trypsin cleavage site to an elastase cleavage site. We chose this cleavage site because elastase is expressed in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the exchange of the cleavage site previously has been shown to attenuate viral growth in lungs. Newly generated elastase-activated influenza viruses (AE viruses) grew to similar titers in tumor cells as the trypsin-activated counterparts (AT viruses). Intratumoral injection of AE viruses into syngeneic B16f1 melanoma-derived tumors in mice reduced tumor growth similar to AT viruses and had a better therapeutic effect in heterologous human PANC-1-derived tumors. Therefore, the introduction of the attenuation marker “elastase cleavage site” in viral HA allows for safe, effective oncolytic virus therapy. © 2017 The Authors","influenza A virus; neutrophilic elastase; oncolytic virotherapy; tumor immunology",Article,Scopus

These elements, collectively referred to as conserved non-coding elements (CNEs), are non-randomly distributed across chromosomes and tend to cluster in the vicinity of genes with regulatory roles in multicellular development and differentiation. CNEs are organized into functional ensembles called genomic regulatory blocks-dense clusters of elements that collectively coordinate the expression of shared target genes, and whose span in many cases coincides with topologically associated domains. CNEs display sequence properties that set them apart from other sequences under constraint, and have recently been proposed as useful markers for the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of organisms. Disruption of several of these elements is known to contribute to diseases linked with development, and cancer. The emergence, evolutionary dynamics and functions of CNEs still remain poorly understood, and new approaches are required to enable comprehensive CNE identification and characterization.

H19 and Igf2 are linked imprinted genes that play critical roles in development. Loss of imprinting (LOI) at the IGF2/H19 locus on the maternal chromosome is associated with the developmental disorder Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) and with several cancers. Here we use comprehensive genetic and genomic analyses to follow muscle development in a mouse model of BWS to dissect the separate and shared roles for misexpression of Igf2 and H19 in the disease phenotype. We show that LOI results in defects in muscle differentiation and hypertrophy and identify primary downstream targets: Igf2 overexpression results in over-activation of MAPK signaling while loss of H19 lncRNA prevents normal down regulation of p53 activity and therefore results in reduced AKT/mTOR signaling. Moreover, we demonstrate instances where H19 and Igf2 misexpression work separately, cooperatively, and antagonistically to establish the developmental phenotype.

The following alterations in features of primary and secondary tumors were analyzed: dimension, degree and type of contrast enhancement, outlines of lesions, presence of intratumoral bleeding, presence of calcifications. Results: In the analyzed group of primary, metastatic and recurrent tumors after treatment with Imatinib in most cases a decrease in size and contrast enhancement were observed; the outlines of lesions became well circumscribed. Following the treatment, the number of tumors enhancing inhomogeneously decreased. In primary tumors the percentage of calcifications increased, whereas in metastatic tumors calcifications were observed only after treatment. There was no bleeding found within primary tumors after treatment. In metastatic disease, increased percentage of tumors with transient intratumoral bleeding was observed.

The findings correlated with in vivo neutralization results, whereby GPVAV was far more effective than Biosave ® in cross-neutralizing the lethality of the venoms by a potency of at least 13 to 80 times higher.

SMOX has been shown to play key roles in inflammation and carcinogenesis; indeed, it is differentially expressed in several human cancer types. Our previous investigation has revealed that SMOX purified after heterologous expression in Escherichia coli actually consists of monomers, covalent homodimers, and other higher-order forms. All association forms oxidize spermine and, after treatment with dithiothreitol, revert to SMOX monomer. Here, we report a detailed investigation on the thermal denaturation of SMOX and its association forms in native and reducing conditions. By combining spectroscopic methods (circular dichroism, fluorescence) and thermal methods (differential scanning calorimetry), we provide new insights into the structure, the transformation, and the stability of SMOX. While the crystal structure of this protein is not available yet, experimental results are interpreted also on the basis of a novel SMOX structural model, obtained in silico exploiting the recently solved acetylspermine oxidase crystal structure. We conclude that while at least one specific intermolecular disulfide bond links two SMOX molecules to form the homodimer, the thermal denaturation profiles can be justified by the presence of at least one intramolecular disulfide bond, which also plays a critical role in the stabilization of the overall three-dimensional SMOX structure, and in particular of its flavin adenine dinucleotide- containing active site. © 2017 The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

This contributes to glioblastoma resistance to standard treatment modalities and allows tumor growth and recurrence. Several immune-targeted approaches have been recently developed and are currently under preclinical and clinical investigation. Oncolytic viruses, including the autonomous protoparvovirus H-1 (H-1PV), show great promise as novel immunotherapeutic tools. In a first phase I/IIa clinical trial (ParvOryx01), H-1PV was safe and well tolerated when locally or systemically administered to recurrent glioblastoma patients. The virus was able to cross the blood-brain (tumor) barrier after intravenous infusion. Importantly, H-1PV treatment of glioblastoma patients was associated with immunogenic changes in the tumor microenvironment. Tumor infiltration with activated cytotoxic T cells, induction of cathepsin B and inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) expression in tumor-associated microglia/macrophages (TAM), and accumulation of activated TAM in cluster of differentiation (CD) 40 ligand (CD40L)-positive glioblastoma regions was detected. These are the first-in-human observations of H-1PV capacity to switch the immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment towards immunogenicity. Based on this pilot study, we present a tentative model of H-1PV-mediated modulation of glioblastoma microenvironment and propose a combinatorial therapeutic approach taking advantage of H-1PV-induced microglia/macrophage activation for further (pre)clinical testing. © 2017 by the authors.

During zebrafish gastrulation, the transmembrane protein Vang-like 2 (VANGL2) is required for PCP and directed cell migration. These cell behaviors occur in the context of a fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM). While it is thought that interactions with the ECM regulate cell migration, it is unclear how PCP proteins such as VANGL2 influence these events. Using an in vitro cell culture model system, we previously showed that human VANGL2 negatively regulates membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MMP14) and activation of secreted matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). Here, we investigated the functional relationship between VANGL2, integrin αvβ3, and MMP2 activation. We provide evidence that VANGL2 regulates cell surface integrin αvβ3 expression and adhesion to fibronectin, laminin, and vitronectin. Inhibition of MMP14/MMP2 activity suppressed the cell adhesion defect in VANGL2 knockdown cells. Furthermore, our data show that MMP14 and integrin αv are required for increased proteolysis by VANGL2 knockdown cells. Lastly, we have identified integrin αvβ3 as a novel VANGL2 binding partner. Together, these findings begin to dissect the molecular underpinnings of how VANGL2 regulates MMP activity and cell adhesion to the ECM. © 2017 The Authors","Adhesion; Extracellular matrix; Integrins; MMP14; MMP2; VANGL2",Article,Scopus

In this work, a selective room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) detection method for miRNA was developed based on a duplex-specific nuclease (DSN) -assisted signal amplification strategy and phosphorescence resonance energy transfer (PRET) between poly-diallyldimethylammonium chloride-modified quantum dots (QDs@PDDA) and 6-carboxy-X-rhodamine-modified miRNA sequences complementary oligonucleotide (ROX-ssDNA). The positively charged QDs@PDDA could adsorb negatively charged ROX-ssDNA by electrostatic interaction, whereas the RTP signal of QDs@PDDA could be efficiently quenched by ROX-ssDNA via PRET. In the presence of microRNA-21 (miR-21) and DSN, miR-21 hybridized with ROX-ssDNA initially to form a DNA-RNA heteroduplex as the substrate of DSN, then ssDNA in DNA-RNA heteroduplex would be cleaved into small fragments by DSN and liberate miR-21 to hybridize with another ROX-ssDNA. Eventually, due to weak interaction between ROX-ssDNA fragments and QDs@PDDA, PRET efficiency continually decreased whereas the RTP signal was significantly amplified. By employing the strategy above, quantitative detection of miR-21 in the range of 0.25–40 nM with a detection limit of 0.16 nM was realized, showing excellent performance with simplicity, good selectivity and the ability to be a promising method for miRNA detection. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Detection; DSN; MiRNA-21; Resonance energy transfer",Article,Scopus

However, typical processes for the formation of polymer vesicles lead to ensembles of structures with a broad size distribution (from nanometer to micrometer scale) which result in a limitation for efficient cellular uptake. In this study, we present a simple and efficient approach for the fabrication of polymer vesicles with uniform nanoscale dimensions from template formation of electrosprayed particles in a high throughput manner. First, electrospraying was applied to produce micrometer-sized templates of a block copolymer before polymer vesicles were formed from the pre-prepared microparticles via rehydration. Four different biocompatible diblock and triblock copolymers were used to successfully fabricate polymer vesicles with uniform size around 150 nm using this approach. Furthermore, we encapsulate anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) within the polymer vesicles via this method. The kinetics of cellular uptake (HeLa cell) and intracellular distribution of DOX-loaded polymer vesicles have been quntified and monitored by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, respectively. The results show that our new method provides a promising way to fabricate drug-loaded polymer vesicles with controllable nanoscale size for intracellular anticancer drug delivery. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Anticancer drug delivery; Controlled size; Microparticle templating; Nanoscale; Polymer vesicles",Article,Scopus

Cohorts were created based on demographic/socioeconomic variables and era of treatment (Era 1: 2003-07, Era 2: 2008-12). Univariate and multivariate analyses identified factors associated with performance of or trends in CLND. Results: 122 849 underwent WLE with SLNB.

Novel treatment approaches that target clinical and cognitive aspects of bipolar depression are needed, and research on pathophysiology suggests that mitochondrial modulators such as the nutraceutical creatine monohydrate might have a therapeutic role for this condition. Methods Eighteen (N=18) patients with bipolar depression according to DSM-IV criteria who were enrollled in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of creatine monohydrate 6 g daily as adjunctive therapy were submitted to neuropsychological assessments (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Third Edition, Stroop Color-Word Test, Rey–Osterrieth complex figure test, FAS Verbal Fluency Test) at baseline and week 6. Results There was a statistically significant difference between the treatment groups of the change on the total scores after 6 weeks in the verbal fluency test, with improvement in the group receiving adjunctive treatment with creatine. We did not find significant differences between the groups of the changes on other neuropsychological tests. Limitations Small sample and lack of a control group of healthy subjects. Conclusions Our trial, which was the first to investigate the cognitive effects of creatine monohydrate on bipolar depression, indicates that supplementation with this nutraceutical for 6 weeks is associated with improvement in verbal fluency tests in patients with this condition. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Adjunctive therapy; Bipolar disorder; Cognition; Creatine monohydrate; Depression; Randomized controlled trial",Review,Scopus

Here, we report a novel molecular mechanism and function of USP14 in regulating autophagy induction and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation induced by toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 (TLR4). USP14 interacted with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and interrupted the association of Beclin 1 with TRAF6, leading to inhibition of TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination of Beclin 1. Reduced expression of USP14 in USP14-knockdown (USP14 KD ) THP-1 cells enhanced autophagy induction upon TLR4 stimulation as shown by the increased conversion of cytosolic LC3-I to membrane-bound LC3-II. Moreover, USP14 KD human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells and USP14 KD human hepatic adenocarcinoma SK-HEP-1 cells showed increased cell migration and invasion, indicating that USP14 is negatively implicated in the cancer progression by the inhibition of autophagy induction. Furthermore, we found that USP14 interacted with TAK1-binding protein (TAB) 2 protein and induced deubiquitination of TAB 2, a key factor in the activation of NF-κB. Functionally, overexpression of USP14 suppressed TLR4-induced activation of NF-κB. In contrast, USP14 KD THP-1 cells showed enhanced activation of NF-κB, NF-κB-dependent gene expression, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Taken together, our data demonstrate that USP14 can negatively regulate autophagy induction by inhibiting Beclin 1 ubiquitination, interrupting association between TRAF6 and Beclin 1, and affecting TLR4-induced activation of NF-κB through deubiquitination of TAB 2 protein. © 2017 Min, Lee, Kim, Chun and Lee.","Autophagy; Beclin 1; TAK1-binding protein 2; Toll-like receptor 4; Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6; Ubiquitination",Article,Scopus

Such A/B toxins generally consist of an enzymatically active Asubunit (e.g., ricin toxin A (RTA)) and one or more cell binding Bsubunit(s), which are responsible for toxin binding to specific cell surface receptors. Our current knowledge of how A/B toxins are capable of efficiently intoxicating cells helped scientists to understand fundamental cellular mechanisms, like endocytosis and intracellular protein sorting in higher eukaryotic cells. From a medical point of view, it is likewise important to identify the major toxin trafficking routes to find adequate treatment solutions for patients or to eventually develop therapeutic toxin-based applications for cancer therapy. Since genome-wide analyses of A/B toxin trafficking in mammalian cells is complex, time-consuming, and expensive, several studies on A/B toxin transport have been performed in the yeast model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Despite being less complex, fundamental cellular processes in yeast and higher eukaryotic cells are similar and very often results obtained in yeast can be transferred to the mammalian situation. Here, we describe a fast and easy to use reporter assay to analyze the intracellular trafficking of RTA in yeast. An essential advantage of the new assay is the opportunity to investigate not only RTA retro-translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the cytosol, but rather endocytosis and retrograde toxin transport from the plasma membrane into the ER. The assay makes use of a reporter plasmid that allows indirect measurement of RTA toxicity through fluorescence emission of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) after in vivo translation. Since RTA efficiently prevents the initiation of protein biosynthesis by 28S rRNA depurination, this assay allows the identification of host cell proteins involved in intracellular RTA transport through the detection of changes in fluorescence emission. © 2017, Journal of Visualized Experiments.

Their ages ranged between 10 to 70 years with a mean age 40 years. They were referred from the outpatient respiratory medicine clinic of the hospital. All patients had been presented clinically with suspicion of PTB. Their clinical features and HRCT findings were investigated to predict the risk for PTB. We then designed provisional HRCT diagnostic criteria based on the results to rank the risk of PTB. A positive tuberculin skin test alone among clinical laboratory findings was significantly associated with an increase of risk of PTB. Centrilobular nodules, large nodules, tree-in-bud appearance and the main lesion being located in S1, S2, and S6 lung segments were significantly associated with an increased risk of PTB.

Methods The cohort comprised of Albertans from the Alberta Health Care Insurance Plan Registry (AHCIP) as of June 30, 2009 and aged 50 years or older. Those who received shingles vaccine were identified from the provincial pharmaceutical information network. The occurrence of incident shingles was identified through both inpatient and outpatients/community care data. Incident shingles was defined as the earliest dated record of ICD 9-CM 053 or ICD-10-CA B02. Starting on November 1, 2009, individuals with no history of shingles or shingles vaccination were followed until Nov 1, 2015 (6 years), or until shingles incidence, death, or AHCIP cancellation (including leaving Alberta). Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated as the inverse of the relative risk of developing incident shingles in each year following vaccination compared to time at risk without vaccination, while adjusting for age, sex, income quintile, and immune compromising conditions (identified from physician claims, inpatient, and cancer registry data). Results There were 1,094,236 individuals in the cohort, with 85,439 (7.80%) vaccinated individuals. The shingles incidence rate was 9.03 [95% CI: 8.95, 9.11] cases per 1,000 person years (49,243 cases). Adjusted VE in the first year following immunization was 50.02% [95% CI: 44.71%, 54.83%] against incident shingles, decreasing to no effect by the fifth year (VE = 14.00% [95% CI: −20.99%, 38.88%]).

Therefore, here we have compared the possible beneficial effects of two different exercise training regimes in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity (DIO). Materials and methods Following 7 wk. on high fat diet (HFD), ten-week-old male ICR mice (n = 30) were assigned to HIIT, distance-matched MICT or remained sedentary for the next 8 constitutive weeks while maintaining the dietary treatments. Age-matched sedentary mice with standard diet were used as a control (n = 10). Exercise was performed on a motorized treadmill for 5 days a week. Key findings Both modes of exercise ameliorated adiposity and related metabolic dysfunction induced by HFD and sedentary lifestyle, while mice following HIIT exhibited significantly lower body weight, percentage of fat mass and smaller adipocyte size. HIIT was more favorable in preventing liver lipid accumulation by restoring mRNA levels of genes involved in hepatic lipogenesis (SREBP1, ACC1, FAS) and β-oxidation (PPARα, CPT1a, HAD). In addition, HIIT was more efficient in mitigating adipose tissue inflammation and insulin insensitivity, partly dependent on abrogating phosphorylation of JNK/IRS1 (Ser307) pathway. Moreover, only HIIT led to pronounced beige adipocyte recruitment in inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Significance We conclude that HIIT contribute a more favorable regulation of metabolic dysfunctions in DIO mice compared with MICT. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Brown adipose tissue; Exercise intervention; Insulin resistance; Lipid metabolism; Obesity",Article,Scopus

To overcome those issues, for the first time, authors presented a novel parallel structural dsDNA/recombinant azurin (PSD/rAzu) hybrid structure for the general nucleic acid detection. The PSD was designed and introduced by the optimized 8 Ag+ ions to have greater conductivity than the canonical dsDNA, and conjugated with rAzu to develop a general platform for electrochemical detection of miRNAs and viral DNAs with high reproducibility and ultra-sensitivity towards single base pair mutation. Thanks to the bifunctional rAzu as the selective spacer and electrochemical signal mediator, in the presence of the target strand, the imperfect PSD switched rapidly to the upright position where the Ag+ ions intercalated between C-C mismatches of dsDNAs at the top of each structure brought further from the electrode surface resulting in a significant electrochemical signal drop of the Ag+ ions. The charge transfer (CT) mechanism across the hybrid structure was simply clarified on the basis of the redox potential location of the species. The electrical conductivity of DNAs were measured using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) at the molecular scale and cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique based on the reduction of Ag+ ion. The proposed PSD/rAzu hybrid structure with a great capability of single mutation recognition and miRNA expression level profiling in cancer cells holds a very promising platform to be studied for further development of various kinds of nanoscale biosensors, bioelectronic devices. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","DNA conductance; DNA conductance; Electrochemical biosensor; MiRNA detection; Nucleic acid detection; Parallel structural dsDNA",Article,Scopus

Survivors often suffer from lasting morbidity from current treatments. New targeted therapies with less toxicity, such as those that harness the immune system, and immunocompetent murine sarcoma models to test these therapies are greatly needed. We characterized two new serendipitous murine models of undifferentiated sarcoma (SARC-28 and SARC-45) and tested their sensitivity to virotherapy with oncolytic herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Both models expressed high levels of the primary HSV entry molecule nectin-1 (CD111) and were susceptible to killing by interleukin-12 (IL-12) producing HSV-1 M002 in vitro and in vivo. M002 resulted in a significant intratumoral increase in effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and activated monocytes, and a decrease in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in immunocompetent mice. Compared to parent virus R3659 (no IL-12 production), M002 resulted in higher CD8:MDSC and CD8:T regulatory cell (Treg) ratios, suggesting that M002 creates a more favorable immune tumor microenvironment. These data provide support for clinical trials targeting sarcomas with oncolytic HSV-1. These models provide an exciting opportunity to explore combination therapies for soft tissue sarcomas that rely on an intact immune system to reach full therapeutic potential. © 2017 The Author(s)","herpes simplex virus; HSV; immunotherapy; M002; murine sarcoma; oncolytic",Article,Scopus

In fact, the indication for robotic surgery in pancreatic disease has been controversial. The present study aimed to assess the safety and feasibility of robotic pancreatic resection. Methods We retrospectively reviewed our experience of robotic pancreatic resection done in Sanchinarro University Hospital. Clinicopathologic characteristics, and perioperative and postoperative outcomes were recorded and analyzed. Results From October 2010 to April 2016, 50 patients underwent robotic-assisted surgery for different pancreatic pathologies. All procedures were performed using the da Vinci robotic system. Of the 50 patients, 26 were male and 24 female. The average age of all patients was 62 years. Operative time was 370 minutes. Among the procedures performed were 16 pancreaticoduodenectomies (PD), 23 distal pan-createctomies (DP), 11 tumor enucleations (TE). The mean hospital stay was 17.6 days in PD group, 9.0 days in DP group and 8.4 days in TE group. Pancreatic fistula occurred in 10 cases (20%), 2 after PD, 3 after DP, and 5 after TE. Four patients had postoperative transfusion in PD group and one in DP group. Conversion to open laparotomy occurred in four patients (8%). No serious intraoperative complications were observed. Conclusions From our early experience, robotic pancreatic surgery is a safe and feasible procedure. Further experience and follow-up are required to confirm the role of robotic approach in pancreatic surgery. © 2017 The Editorial Board of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Diseases International","minimal invasive surgery; pancreatic cancer; robotic surgery",Article,Scopus

The ibrutinib target, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), is essential for B-cell receptor signaling, and most resistant cases carry mutations in BTK or PLCG2, a downstream effector target of BTK. Recent findings show that MI-2, a small molecule inhibitor of the para-caspase MALT1, is effective in preclinical models of another type of BCR pathway- dependent lymphoma. We therefore studied the activity of MI- 2 against CLL and ibrutinib-resistant CLL. Treatment of CLL cells in vitro with MI-2 inhibited MALT1 proteolytic activity reduced BCR and NF-kB signaling, inhibited nuclear translocation of RelB and p50, and decreased Bcl-xL levels. MI-2 selectively induced dose and time-dependent apoptosis in CLL cells, sparing normal B lymphocytes. Furthermore, MI-2 abrogated survival signals provided by stromal cells and BCR crosslinking and was effective against CLL cells harboring features associated with poor outcomes, including 17p deletion and unmutated IGHV. Notably, MI-2 was effective against CLL cells collected from patients harboring mutations conferring resistance to ibrutinib. Overall, our findings provide a preclinical rationale for the clinical development of MALT1 inhibitors in CLL, in particular for ibrutinib-resistant forms of this disease. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",,Article,Scopus

These pipelines often suffer from a number of shortcomings: they lack robustness and have many components written in multiple languages, each with a variety of resource requirements. Pipeline components must be linked together with a workflow system to achieve the processing of FASTQ files through to a VCF file of variants. Crafting these pipelines requires considerable bioinformatics and IT skills beyond the reach of many clinical laboratories. Results: Here we present Canary, a single program that can be run on a laptop, which takes FASTQ files from amplicon assays through to an annotated VCF file ready for clinical analysis. Canary can be installed and run with a single command using Docker containerization or run as a single JAR file on a wide range of platforms. Although it is a single utility, Canary performs all the functions present in more complex and unwieldy pipelines. All variants identified by Canary are 3' shifted and represented in their most parsimonious form to provide a consistent nomenclature, irrespective of sequencing variation. Further, proximate in-phase variants are represented as a single HGVS 'delins' variant. This allows for correct nomenclature and consequences to be ascribed to complex multi-nucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs), which are otherwise difficult to represent and interpret. Variants can also be annotated with hundreds of attributes sourced from MyVariant.info to give up to date details on pathogenicity, population statistics and in-silico predictors. Conclusions: Canary has been used at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne for the last 2 years for the processing of clinical sequencing data. By encapsulating clinical features in a single, easily installed executable, Canary makes sequencing more accessible to all pathology laboratories.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs of approximately nucleotides that regulate several aspects of tumors pathogenesis, including migration, invasion, metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We have found that miR-107 was significantly high expression in PDAC tissues and cells. High miR-107 expression is associated with poor clinicopathological parameters and prognosis in PDAC patients. Deregulated expression of miR-107 in PDAC cells (AsPC-1 and Panc-1) is sufficient to reduce cell migration and invasion, and to induce upregulation of epithelial markers (β-catenin, ZO-1 and E-cadherin) and a decrease of mesenchymal marker expression (ZEB-1 and vimentin). We also found that the caveolin-1, PTEN and p-Akt expression are modulated by miR-107 in PDAC cells. Moreover, our study clearly demonstrated that deregulated expression of miR-107 inhibited cell migration and invasion and EMT by up-regulation of caveolin-1 and PTEN, and inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling in PDAC cells.

FUBP1 expression is required for HCC tumor cell expansion, and it functions as an important pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic oncoprotein that binds to the single-stranded DNA sequence FUSE to regulate the transcription of a variety of target genes. In this study, we screened an FDA-approved drug library and discovered that the Topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitor camptothecin (CPT) and its derivative 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), the active irinotecan metabolite that is used in the clinics in combination with other chemotherapeutics to treat carcinoma, inhibit FUBP1 activity.

These molecules trigger intracellular signaling pathways inducing the expression of inflammatory genes by NF-kB translocation. Gefitinib (GBTC) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) are capable of inhibiting EGFR/NOD2 and NF-kB, respectively. In earlier stages of dengue virus (DENV) infection, monocytes are capable of sustaining viral replication and increasing cytokine production, suggesting that monocyte/macrophages play an important role in early DENV replication. GBTC and PDTC have not been used to modify the pathogenesis of DENV in infected cells. This study was aimed to determine the effect of GBTC and PDTC on viral replication and cytokine production in DENV serotype 2 (DENV2)–infected human monocyte cultures. Main methods GBTC and PDTC were used to inhibit EGFR/NOD2 and NF-kB, respectively. Cytokine production was measured by ELISA and viral replication by plaque forming unit assay. Key findings Increased DENV2 replication and anti-viral cytokine production (IFN-α/β, TNF-α, IL-12 and IL-18) in infected cultures were found. These parameters were decreased after EGFR/NOD2 or NF-kB inhibitions.

Auranofin has the capacity to selectively inhibit endogenous antioxidant enzymes thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), resulting in oxidative stress and the initiation of a pro-apoptotic cascade. The effect of Auranofin exposure on TrxR and GPx, and the potential for cellular protection through selenium supplementation was examined in the non-cancerous human cell line Swan-71. Auranofin exposure resulted in a concentration dependent differential inhibition of selenoprotein antioxidants. Significant inhibition of TrxR was observed at 20 nM Auranofin with inhibition of GPx from 10 µM. Significant increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) were associated with antioxidant inhibition at Auranofin concentrations of 100 nM (TrxR inhibition) and 10 µM (TrxR and GPx inhibition), respectively. Evaluation of mitochondrial respiration demonstrated significant reductions in routine and maximal respiration at both 100 nM and 10 μM Auranofin. Auranofin treatment at concentrations of 10 μM and higher concentrations resulted in a ∼68% decrease in cellular viability and was associated with elevations in pro-apoptotic markers cytochrome c flux control factor (FCFc) at concentration of 100 nM and mitochondrial Bax at 10 μM. The supplementation of selenium (100 nM) prior to treatment had a generalized protective affect through the restoration of antioxidant activity with a significant increase in TrxR and GPx activity, a significant reduction in ROS and associated improvement in mitochondrial respiration and cellular viability (10 µM ∼48% increase). Selenium supplementation reduced the FCFc at low doses of Auranofin (<10 μM) however no effect was noted on either FCFc or Bax at concentrations above 10 μM. The inhibition of antioxidant systems in non-cancerous cells by Auranofin is strongly dose dependent, and this inhibition can be altered by selenium exposure. Therefore, Auranofin dose and the selenium status of patients are important considerations in the therapeutic use of Auranofin as an agent of chemosensitization. © 2017","Auranofin; Glutathione peroxidase; Oxidative stress; Reactive oxygen species; Selenium; Thioredoxin reductase",Article,Scopus

However, the association between NT-proBNP and poor prognosis after ischemic stroke is still uncertain. The aim of this study was to examine whether serum NT-proBNP is associated with global clinical outcomes in a large cohort of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Methods: Baseline serum NT-proBNP level was measured in a subset of 3126 patients with acute ischemic stroke, and the patients were followed up to assess their clinical outcomes within 1 year after the stroke. Cox proportional hazard models and logistic regression models were used to assess the effects of NT-proBNP on the primary outcome (composite outcome of death and vascular events) and poor functional outcomes. Results: During 1 year of follow-up, 278 (9.0%) patients with a primary outcome and 685 (22.1%) patients with a poor functional outcome were identified. The cumulative incidence of primary outcomes increased across serum NT-proBNP quartiles (log-rank P &lt; 0.001). Hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile were 1.47 (1.01–2.13) for the primary outcome, 1.79 (1.07–2.98) for death after multivariable adjustment. In addition, serum NT-proBNP was also associated with poor functional outcomes (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.94; Ptrend = 0.008). Conclusions: This study showed that high NT-proBNP levels increased the risk of a composite outcome of death and vascular events and poor functional outcomes at 1 year after stroke onset among ischemic stroke patients with elevated blood pressure, suggesting that NT-proBNP might be a potential prognostic factor for ischemic stroke. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","All-cause mortality; Functional outcome; Ischemic stroke; NT-proBNP; Prognosis",Article,Scopus

CCHCC is composed of mixtures of clear and/or acidophilic ground glass hepatocytes with excessive glycogen and/or fat and shares histology, clinical features and etiology with common HCCs. Studies in animal models of chemical, hormonal and viral hepatocarcinogenesis and observations in patients with chronic liver diseases prone to develop HCC have shown that the majority of HCCs are preceded by, or associated with, focal or diffuse excessive storage of glycogen (glycogenosis) which later may be replaced by fat (lipidosis/steatosis). In ground glass cells, the glycogenosis is accompanied by proliferation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which is closely related to glycogen particles and frequently harbors the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). From the findings in animal models a sequence of changes has been established, commencing with preneoplastic glycogenotic liver lesions, often containing ground glass cells, and progressing to glycogen-poor neoplasms via various intermediate stages, including glycogenotic/lipidotic clear cell foci, clear cell hepatocellular adenomas (CCHCA) rich in glycogen and/or fat, and CCHCC. A similar process seems to take place in humans, with clear cells frequently persisting in CCHCC and steatohepatitic HCC, which presumably represent intermediate stages in the development rather than particular variants of HCC. During the progression of the preneoplastic lesions, the clear and ground glass cells transform into cells characteristic of common HCC. The sequential cellular changes are associated with metabolic aberrations, which start with an activation of the insulin signaling cascade resulting in pre-neoplastic hepatic glycogenosis. The molecular and metabolic changes underlying the glycogenosis/lipidosis are apparently responsible for the dramatic metabolic shift from gluconeogenesis to the pentose phosphate pathway and Warburg-type glycolysis, which provide precursors and energy for an ever increasing cell proliferation during progression. © 2017 The Editorial Board of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Diseases International","clear cell hepatocellular carcinoma; glycogenosis; lipidosis; metabolic aberrations; phenotypic heterogeneity; preneoplastic glycogenosis; progression",Review,Scopus

We examined the national inpatient trends of TACE and related outcomes in the United States over the last decade. Methods We utilized the National Inpatient Sample (2002 to 2012) and performed trend analyses of TACE for HCC in all adult patients (age >18 years). Multivariate analyses for the outcomes of in-hospital “procedure-related complications” (PRCs) and “post-procedure complications” (PPCs) were performed. We also compared early (2002 to 2006) and late (2007 to 2012) eras by multivariate analyses to identify predictors of complications, healthcare resource utilization and mortality. Results Overall, 19058 patients underwent TACE for HCC where PRCs and PPCs were seen in 24.2% and 17.6% of patients, respectively. The overall trends in the use of TACE (P<0.001) and associated PRCs (P=0.006) were observed to be increasing. There was less mortality [adjusted Odds ratio (aOR): 0.58; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.82], reduced length of hospital stay (−1.87 days; 95% CI: −2.77, −0.97) and increased hospital charges ($19232; 95% CI: 11013, 27451) in the late era. Additionally, there was increased mortality (aOR: 4.07; 95% CI: 2.96, 5.59), PRCs (aOR: 3.21; 95% CI: 2.56, 4.02), and PPCs (aOR: 2.70; 95% CI: 2.11, 3.46) among patients with coagulopathy. Conclusions There is an increasing trend of TACE utilization in HCC. However, the outcomes are worse in patients with coagulopathy. Although PRCs have increased, mortality has decreased in recent years. These findings should be considered during TACE evaluation in patients with HCC. © 2017 The Editorial Board of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Diseases International","hepatocellular carcinoma; mortality; procedural complications; transarterial chemoembolization",Article,Scopus

The costimulation and antitumor activity of CD27 agonistic Abs have been well documented in mouse models. Clinical testing of a human IgG1 anti-CD27 Ab, varlilumab (clone 1F5), is ongoing in cancer patients. In this study, we set out to further understand CD27 as an immunomodulatory target and to address the mechanism of antitumor efficacy using different IgG isotypes of 1F5 in human CD27-transgenic mice. 1F5mIgG1, the only isotype engaging inhibitory FcgRIIB expressed in B cells, elicited the most potent and broad immune response, but terminal differentiation, exhaustion, and apoptosis in the activated effector T cells were inevitable. Accordingly, this isotype was the most effective in eradicating BCL1 lymphoma but had limited efficacy in s.c. Tumors. Conversely, 1F5mIgG2a, which interacts with cells expressing activating FcgRs, led to moderate immune activation, as well as to prominent reduction in the number and suppressive activity of regulatory T cells. These combined mechanisms imparted potent antitumor activity to 1F5mIgG2a, particularly against the s.c. Tumors. 1F5hIgG1, varlilumab, showed balanced agonistic activity that was prominent at lower doses and depleting activity that was greater at higher doses. 1F5hIgG1 had good antitumor activity in all tumor models tested. Thus, both agonist and depleting properties contribute to the antitumor efficacy of CD27-targeted immunotherapy, and modulation of these activities in patients may be achieved by varying the dose and regimen.

However, some patients with indolent MCL can survive beyond 7~10 years. These patients remain largely asymptomatic and can be in observation for a long time without any treatment. The process of ""wait and watch"" leaves these patients with the potential risk of evolution to classic, aggressive MCL. On the other hand, early treatment for these patients may not impact overall survival but rather affects the quality of life. Therefore, it is essential to clearly identify this type of indolent MCL at the time of diagnosis. Results: Reported findings of indolent presentation of MCL include: lack of B symptoms, normal serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and β2-microglobulin levels (β2M), low MCL-International Prognostic Index (MIPI) score, maximum tumor diameter less than 3 cm, spleen size < 20 cm, positron emission tomography/computerized tomography with the Standard Uptake Value max <6, Ki-67 less than 30%, with some particular immunophenotype, such as CD5 and CD38 negative, markedly increased CD23 positive lymphocytes proportions, high expression of CD200, kappa light chain restriction, without C-myc, TP53 and NOTCH1/2 mutations, non-blastoid/pleomorphic histology, and no tumor growth on reevaluation every 2~3 months (followed for at least 6 months). Imaging evaluation may only be performed in the presence of disease-related symptoms or organ involvement. Meanwhile, if novel nodal or extranodal lesion is found, biopsy is mandatory to exclude lymphoma. Common clinopathological forms of indolent presentations include monoclonal B lymphocytosis with t (11; 14); ""indolent leukemic"" presentation of MCL with involvement of peripheral blood, bone marrow involvement, splenomegaly, and minimal lymphadenopathies and in situ lymphoma (often found in lymph nodes removed for other reasons, and in gastrointestinal biopsies). Conclusions: Considering these distinct indolent clinical presentations with particular features in cytology and gene mutational status, we propose to include these MCL clinical presentations under the umbrella of ""Smoldering Mantle Cell Lymphoma"". © 2017 The Author(s).","Indolent MCL; Mantle cell lymphoma; Smoldering lymphoma",Review,Scopus

Here we report the immunomodulatory activity of licorice polysaccharides in vivo. Methods: The differential anticancer activities of licorice polysaccharides by tumorigenesis and immunomodulation was evaluated in vivo. Six weeks old, 120 CT-26 tumor bearing BALB/c mice, weighing 20±2g were used. They were randomly divided into six groups, three groups receiving high molecular weight (fraction A), low molecular weight (fraction B) polysaccharides and crude extract (fraction C); positive, negative and normal groups receiving cytoxin, saline and normal diet respectively. Weight of mice and tumors was determined and tumorigenicity assay calculated to determine the anticancer effects. Immunomodulatory potential was determined by immune organ indices, immune cell population and serum cytokine levels using immune organ weight and index, flow cytometry and cytokine/chemokine bead panel kit respectively. Results: Licorice polysaccharides exhibited immunomodulatory activities in CT 26 tumor bearing BALB/c mice. The polysaccharides significantly suppressed tumor growth and increased immune organ index. Furthermore, the immunomodulatory effect was evident with activation of CD4+ and CD8+ immune cells population. The polysaccharides also affected the production of various cytokines, by increasing IL 2, IL 6, IL 7 levels and a decreasing TNFα levels. Conclusion: In summary, licorice polysaccharide especially of low molecular weight exhibit anticancer and immunomodulatory activities by suppressing tumor growth and improving general health of mice. They also augment the thymus/spleen index and population of T lymphocytes. Furthermore, the polysaccharides enhance the levels of serum antitumor cytokines, IL 2, IL 6 and IL 7 while decreasing pro-tumor cytokine TNFα. © 2017 The Author(s).","Anticancer; Immunomodulation; Licorice; Polysaccharides; Tumor",Article,Scopus

Bovine lactose is also a key component of many human food products. However, compared to analyses of other milk components, the genetic control of lactose has been little studied. Here we present the first GWAS focussed on analysis of milk lactose traits. Results: Using a discovery population of 12,000 taurine dairy cattle, we detail 27 QTL for lactose concentration and yield, and subsequently validate the effects of 26 of these loci in a distinct population of 18,000 cows. We next present data implicating causative genes and variants for these QTL. Fine mapping of these regions using imputed, whole genome sequence-resolution genotypes reveals protein-coding candidate causative variants affecting the ABCG2, DGAT1, STAT5B, KCNH4, NPFFR2 and RNF214 genes. Eleven of the remaining QTL appear to be driven by regulatory effects, suggested by the presence of co-locating, co-segregating eQTL discovered using mammary RNA sequence data from a population of 357 lactating cows. Pathway analysis of genes representing all lactose-associated loci shows significant enrichment of genes located in the endoplasmic reticulum, with functions related to ion channel activity mediated through the LRRC8C, P2RX4, KCNJ2 and ANKH genes. A number of the validated QTL are also found to be associated with additional milk volume, fat and protein phenotypes. Conclusions: Overall, these findings highlight novel candidate genes and variants involved in milk lactose regulation, whose impacts on membrane transport mechanisms reinforce the key osmo-regulatory roles of lactose in milk. © 2017 The Author(s).","Genome sequencing; GWAS; Lactose; Milk; QTL mapping; RNA sequencing",Article,Scopus

Identification of fungi causing invasive fungal disease (IFD) is critical for guiding antifungal therapy. We describe the performance and clinical impact of a targeted panfungal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicon sequencing assay for culture-independent diagnosis of IFD. Methods. Between January 2009 and September 2016, 233 specimens, consisting of fresh and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues and sterile body fluids with known diagnosis of IFD based on reference method results (n = 117), and specimens with negative fungal culture, but with microscopic and ancillary findings indicative of IFD (n = 116), were included. PCR amplicons from the internal transcribed spacer 2 and the D2 region of 28S ribosomal RNA gene were sequenced and fungi identified. Results. Sensitivity and specificity of fungal sequencing in specimens with known diagnosis were 96.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 87.4%-99.4%; 58/60) and 98.2% (95% CI, 89.4%-99.9%; 56/57). In patients with suspected IFD, the diagnostic yield of fungal sequencing was 62.9% (73/116) overall and 71.3% (57/80) in patients classified with proven IFD based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria. Samples obtained by open biopsy had a significantly higher diagnostic yield (71.5% [40/56]) compared with core-needle biopsy (50% [17/34] P = .04) and fine needle aspiration (0% [0/2]; P = .009). Additionally, D2 sequencing diagnosed 5 cases of invasive protozoal infections due to Toxoplasma gondii (n = 3), Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania species. Sequencing results altered patient management in the majority of suspected cases. Conclusions. The targeted fungal sequencing assay allowed accurate identification of fungi causing IFD and additionally provided partial-protozoal coverage.

These include roles in the development of the secondary sexual organs in both sexes, plus uterine angiogenesis and proliferation during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy in women. The varied biological roles of estrogens in human health also make them a therapeutic target for contraception, mitigation of the adverse effects of the menopause, and treatment of estrogen-responsive tumours. In addition, endogenous (e.g. genetic variation) and external (e.g. exposure to estrogen-like chemicals) factors are known to impact estrogen biology. To understand how these multiple factors interact to determine an individual's response to therapy is complex, and may be best approached through a systems approach. Methods: We present a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model (PBPK) of estradiol, and validate it against plasma kinetics in humans following intravenous and oral exposure. We extend this model by replacing the intrinsic clearance term with: a detailed kinetic model of estrogen metabolism in the liver; or, a genome-scale model of liver metabolism. Both models were validated by their ability to reproduce clinical data on estradiol exposure. We hypothesise that the enhanced mechanistic information contained within these models will lead to more robust predictions of the biological phenotype that emerges from the complex interactions between estrogens and the body. Results: To demonstrate the utility of these models we examine the known drug-drug interactions between phenytoin and oral estradiol. We are able to reproduce the approximate 50% reduction in area under the concentration-time curve for estradiol associated with this interaction. Importantly, the inclusion of a genome-scale metabolic model allows the prediction of this interaction without directly specifying it within the model. In addition, we predict that PXR activation by drugs results in an enhanced ability of the liver to excrete glucose. This has important implications for the relationship between drug treatment and metabolic syndrome. Conclusions: We demonstrate how the novel coupling of PBPK models with genome-scale metabolic networks has the potential to aid prediction of drug action, including both drug-drug interactions and changes to the metabolic landscape that may predispose an individual to disease development. © 2017 The Author(s).","Breast cancer; Drug-drug interaction; Endocrine disruptor; Estrogen; Estrogen receptor; GSMN; Liver metabolism; Multi-scale; Ordinary differential equation; PBPK; Physiologically-based pharmacokinetics",Article,Scopus

These endocrine disruptors are toxic, highly volatile and easily absorbed by the lungs and can cause adverse consequences for the human health as neurological diseases and cancer. A method for the analysis of BTEX and its metabolites (phenols and aromatic acids) in teeth is presented. The method consists in a one-step simple extraction procedure from spiked tooth using NaOH solution followed by SPME-HPLC or HS-SPME-GC/MS determination. Optimization of both, spiking procedure and extraction step of these analytes from tooth, was carried out. Two fibers CAR/PDMS for BTEX and PA for BTEX metabolites were used for the SPME and variables were optimized for analytes at 30 °C using spiked solutions. The optimized adsorption times were 30, 75 and 30 min and desorption times were 10, 40 and 30 min for BTEX, phenols and aromatic acids, respectively. Linearity for SPME-HPLC method was established using spiked solutions with both, BTEX and metabolites, at 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 25.0 μg/mL. The obtained results indicated a good linearity (r2 above 0.994) for all analytes. Triplicate analyses were performed with RSD lower than 15%. LODs were in the range 0.2–33.3 ng/mL for SPME-HPLC and 0.06–0.09 pg/mL for HS-SPME-GC/MS methods in spiking solutions. Once the method was optimized, bovine teeth were used as biological matrix model for the tuning of spiking and extraction steps. Optimal adsorption and desorption times were 4 h for both procedures. Micrograms per tooth gram of BTEX and phenols were quantified in ten human teeth and aromatic acids were not identified. The developed method for BTEX and metabolites analyses using SPME-HPLC or HS-SPME-GC/MS shows good precision, linearity and sensitivity.

A critically important extension of that premise is that traditional approaches to characterize the effects of drugs and chemicals on the immune system, as assessed in young adult animals, would miss the susceptibility associated with the developing immune system. There is no question that DIT can be-and has been-conducted as ""stand-alone"" studies. However, the consensus is that DIT should be integrated into the protocols associated with developmental and reproductive toxicology (DART) study designs to the extent possible.The aforementioned approach is not without complications. Following an Introduction, this chapter describes pregnancy as a unique situation in which the immune system plays a major role in maternal tolerance of a semiallogenic fetus. Both local and systemic adaptations such as selective immune tolerance, immunosuppression, and immunomodulation are involved in facilitating and maintaining a successful pregnancy, while maternal immunity is protected. This phenomenon involves complicated processes including many different mechanisms working in synergy. This chapter reviews the roles of different cell types and their interactions. However, while much progress has been made in understanding the roles of different cell types and their interactions over the past few decades, the exact roles of interactions between different cell types in the environment needed for a successful pregnancy are not yet fully understood. The complexity of this situation will be increased as more immunosuppressants and immunomodulators are tested in DART study designs-a point underscored by a case study centered on cancer immunotherapeutic agents.The third section of this chapter focuses on the influence of the gut microbiome on reproductive and developmental immunology. While myriad roles have been assigned to the gastrointestinal (GI) microbes, one of the most important roles is the stimulation of appropriate immune system development. The fourth part of this chapter reviews the development of the immune system as a highly regulated process, which is not fully completed at birth. Human neonates have deficiencies in both the innate and adaptive immunity due to the immaturity of their immune system. This makes newborns more susceptible to infections than older children and adults. And, as noted above, the developing immune system can also be more vulnerable than the adult system to chemically induced immunotoxicity. In addition to a review of the developing immune systems in humans, this section of the chapter highlights some of the differences between humans and critical nonclinical species.The fifth part of this chapter focuses on some of the specific end points that have been included in DIT study designs. The final part of this chapter describes the current state of the implementation of DIT into regulatory guidelines for toxicity testing. This stage in the evolution of DIT is critical to improve hazard identification and risk assessment in preclinical studies and should ultimately shed light on the susceptibility of children, thereby providing better protection of their health. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Developmental immunology; Developmental immunotoxicology; Reproductive immunology",Book Chapter,Scopus

Thus, the aim of this study was to determine any association between the presence of microorganisms of gynecological importance, sexual behavior, clinical and demographical variables to the development and progress of cervical lesions. Methods: One hundred and thirty-two women between 14 and 78 years and living at Vitória da Conquista, Bahia, Brazil, were included (62 individuals with cervical lesions and 70 without lesions). They answered a questionnaire to provide data for a socioeconomic and sexual activity profile. Samples of cervical swabs were collected and analyzed by PCR to detect genital microorganisms and HPV. Quantitative PCR was used to detect and quantify Ureaplasma urealyticum and Ureaplasma parvum. Univariate and multiple logistic regression were performed to measure the association with the cervical lesions, and an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. The Mann-Whitney U test was also used to compare the microorganism load in the case and control groups. The significance level was 5% in all hypotheses tested. Results: Cervical lesions were associated with: women in a stable sexual relationship (OR = 14.21, 95%CI = 3.67-55.018), positive PCR for HPV (OR = 16.81, 95%CI = 4.19-67.42), Trichomonas vaginalis (OR = 8.566, 95%CI = 2.04-35.94) and Gardnerella vaginalis (OR = 6.13, 95%CI = 1.53-24.61), adjusted by age and qPCR for U. parvum. U. parvum load showed a statistical difference between the case and control groups (p-value = 0.002). Conclusion: Variables such as stable relationship, HPV, T. vaginalis, G. vaginalis were associated with cervical lesions in epidemiological studies. U. parvum load was higher in woman with cervical lesions compared with women without lesions. Additional studies are needed to better understand the role of these factors in cervical lesion development. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cervical cancer; HPV; Sexually transmitted infections; U.

The drug was suspended from Indian market in June 2013 due to the risk of bladder cancer but was reintroduced in July 2013 because its benefits outweighed the risks. The risks associated with pioglitazone can be minimized if its dose is reduced. Hypothesis Ellagic acid, a polyphenolic antioxidant, is reported to reduce blood sugar in diabetic rats. The mechanism of anti-diabetic action of ellagic acid is not known. Drugs with same pharmacological action but different mechanism may act in synergistic way when combined together. The combination of ellagic acid with pioglitazone could enhance its activity and hence reduce its dose. Study design and methods Diabetes was induced in Wistar rats by intraperitoneal administration of 175 mg of nicotinamide/kg body weight in combination with 65 mg of streptozotocin/kg body weight and then fed with high fat diet for 4 weeks (Group II-VII). Non-diabetic rats were fed with normal chow diet (Group I). Group I and II received vehicle only whereas group III to VII received ellagic acid, pioglitazone or their combination. The treatment was given orally once a day for 21 days. Results The induction of type 2 diabetes in rats caused increase in blood glucose, LDL, triglyceride, and cholesterol and decrease in HDL. The diabetic rats showed improvement in hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, liver and kidney function markers after treatment with ellagic acid, pioglitazone or their combinations. A combination of 10 mg of ellagic acid/kg BW with 10 mg of pioglitazone/kg BW resulted in significant improvement in all the biochemical parameters when compared to any of the individual treatment. The treatment of diabetic rats with the same combination significantly increased the expression levels of GLUT4, PPAR-γ and adiponectin in skeletal muscle. Conclusion The present study indicates that the dose of pioglitazone, required to achieve normoglycemia in diabetic rats, can be reduced by two folds by combining it with ellagic acid. The combinations reported here can be superior, since dose associated side effects and toxicity of the pioglitazone can be reduced. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Adiponectin; Ellagic acid; Pioglitazone; Synergy; Type 2 diabetes",Article,Scopus

The compounds demonstrated strong and selective cytotoxicity in the human eosinophilic leukemia cell line EOL-1, whereas several other cell lines were substantially less sensitive. The cytotoxicity in EOL-1, which is known to express the FIP1L1‐PDGFRA fusion gene encoding an oncogenic kinase, correlated significantly with PDGFRα inhibition. EOL-1 cells treated with the compounds also exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of PDGFRα autophosphorylation and suppression of its downstream signaling pathways with concomitant G1 phase arrest, confirming the proposed mechanism of action.

To impact these hormonal systems, a chemical may need only to impact the system during the peak, critical developmental time window of exposure, in utero exposure, and persistent, longer term exposure measured in months, years, and even over the course of a lifetime. The endpoints cover developmental, organogenesis, cancer, metabolism, and complicated neural networks.In 1996, the United States Congress directed the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as stated in the 1996 amendments to the Food Quality Protection Act and Safe Drinking Water Act, to identify chemicals with the potential to interact with the endocrine system and, subsequently, to test those that may warrant additional longer term definitive tests for regulatory determinations.To this end, in 1998, the EPA had developed its Endocrine Disruption Screening Program (EDSP), which employs a two-tiered screening and testing approach; together in partnership with the global regulatory community, the Agency had taken up the charge to scientifically develop and validate test methods and issue endocrine test orders to screen and test >. 50 chemicals since 2009 for endocrine activity and adversity. And only recently has EPA issued its weight-of-evidence determinations for the initial list of 52 chemicals, which concludes that only 18 have been identified for further testing. EDSP Tiered Screening and Testing Approach: Tier 1 Short-Term Screening Battery-intended to determine whether chemical substances have the potential to interact with the endocrine systemTier 2 Longer Term Reproduction Studies-to test chemical substances to determine the dose-response and apical endpoint for risk assessment purposesWhile the EPA EDSP has employed a two-tiered screening and testing approach, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has developed a five-level conceptual framework. Different from the EDSDP Tiered screening and testing, the conceptual framework is not responsive to legislative mandates and is not a regulatory decision-making framework. These five levels are populated with available endocrine specific and nonspecific assays, depending on the complexity of the test systems, and graded based on levels of economic investments. OECD Conceptual Framework: Level 1: Existing data and nontest information Level 2: In vitro assays providing data about selected endocrine mechanisms/pathways, including mammalian and nonmammalian methods Level 3: In vivo assays providing data about selected endocrine mechanisms/pathways Level 4: In vivo assays providing data on adverse effects on endocrine-relevant endpoints Level 5: In vivo assays providing more comprehensive data on adverse effects on endocrine-relevant endpoints over more extensive parts of the life cycle of the organismTo date, there are >. 40 different ecological and mammalian assays included in the OECD Conceptual Framework, and there are additional assays being developed in other parts of the world for submission to OECD for validation and inclusion in the Endocrine Disruptor Testing Assessment considerations. Despite the volume and complexity of these existing test methods, as evident in the EDSP Tier 1 battery of assays, no single assay alone is capable of determining endocrine activity or adversity. It is done through the collective consideration of multiple assays, along a biological continuum, with the determination of complementarity and necessary redundancies that enhance the overall confidence of the assessment as to whether the chemical elicits an endocrine perturbation that is sufficient to lead to a subsequent adverse health outcome.The adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework is an organizing framework that allows the sophisticated integration of different data streams across various biological levels of organization. This framework allows for the simultaneous evaluation of both toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic relationships across and within species. As evident in the EDSP Tier 1 battery of assays and the OECD Conceptual Framework, the AOP concept is embedded in the logic of the assays selected in each Tier, for each endocrine pathway. Each AOP pathway starts with a molecular initiating event leading to effects at the tissue, organ, organism, and population levels. As the AOP concept is accepted in the regulatory risk assessment context and testing methods advance to shift from whole-animal systems to in vitro high-throughput methods, regulatory agencies will have to determine whether to remain committed to the traditional whole-animal, in vivo test methods that have been validated and globally accepted as being the only methods capable of testing the complex and interconnected endocrine systems, or whether there is sufficient knowledge of the AOP pathway to rely on in vitro methods that indicate that a molecular initiating event is sufficient and adequate for regulatory decision making.The weight-of-evidence (WOE) assessment of extant endocrine- and nonendocrine-specific assays will undoubtedly inform the regulatory risk assessment paradigm. These integrated, WOE decisions are dependent on the available scientific data (e.g., high throughput, in silico, in vitro, and in vivo) and dependent on the nature of the regulatory question set at the problem formulation stage. Different regulatory questions will have varying levels of ""acceptable uncertainty""; a decision of when to prioritize a chemical for screening will be very different from the regulatory management decision of whether to register a new chemistry for use on food commodities. The regulatory context in which the question is being posed will often dictate the level of endocrine screening and testing that may be warranted, both from regulatory and research perspectives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Adverse outcome pathway; Endocrine disruption; Endocrine system; Screening assays; Toxicology; Weight of evidence",Book Chapter,Scopus

This early stage of bladder cancer is most often treated with transurethral resection of bladder tumor. This may be followed either by observation (close follow-up without further treatment) or by intravesical therapy to try to keep the cancer from coming back. Of the intravesical treatments, immunotherapy with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) seems to be better than chemotherapy at both keeping cancers from coming back and from getting worse. But it also tends to have more side effects. Ta stage bladder cancers rarely need to be treated with more extensive surgery. Cystectomy (removal of the bladder) is considered only when there are many superficial cancers or when a superficial cancer continues to grow (or seems to be spreading) despite treatment. Stage I bladder cancers have grown into the connective tissue layer of the bladder wall but have not reached the muscle layer. If no other treatment is given, many patients will later get a new bladder cancer, which will often be more advanced. This is more likely to happen if the first cancer is high grade.

The theme - United Against Cancer: Prevention to End-of-Life Care - reflected this joint vision and the drive to remember that cancer care should include prevention, early diagnosis and screening, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care. The conference brought together 451 delegates from 17 countries. The key themes of the conference included: the importance of the World Health Assembly Resolutions on Palliative Care (2014) and cancer care (2017); the need to develop a National Cancer Control Programme; strategies for effective cancer diagnosis and treatment in low- and middle-income countries; advocacy, human rights and access to essential medicines, including access to opioids and nurse prescribing; paediatric care; leadership and commitment; collaboration; resources (financial and human), the recognition that palliative care is not limited to cancer care and the importance of learning from each other. The conference also gave the opportunity to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the UCI, with a celebration dinner attended by the Minister of Health and the US Ambassador. Participants reported that the conference was a forum that updated them in all aspects of cancer and palliative care, which challenged their knowledge, and was enlightening in terms of current treatment options for individuals with cancer. The benefits of having a joint conference were recognised, allowing for further networking between cancer and palliative care organisations.

METHODS Eighty-Three gastric cancer patients were evaluated in this study. Gastric cancer specimens were evaluated for the gene expression of CTAs, Kitakyushu lung cancer antigen-1 (KK-LC-1), melanoma antigen (MAGE)-A1, MAGE-A3 and New York esophageal cancer-1 (NYESO- 1), by reverse transcription PCR. Clinicopathological background information, such as gender, age, tumor size, macroscopic type, tumor histology, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, and pathological stage, was obtained. Statistical comparisons between the expression of each CTA and each clinicopathological background were performed using the χ 2 test. RESULTS The expression rates of KK-LC-1, MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3, and NY-ESO-1 were 79.5%, 32.5%, 39.8%, and 15.7%, respectively. In early stage gastric cancer specimens, the expression of KK-LC-1 was 79.4%, which is comparable to the 79.6% observed in advanced stage specimens. The expression of KK-LC-1 was not significantly associated with clinicopathological factors, while there were considerable differences in the expression rates of MAGE-A1 and MAGE-A3 with vs without lymphatic invasion (MAGE-A1, 39.3% vs 13.6%, P = 0.034; MAGE-A3, 47.5% vs 18.2%, P = 0.022) and/or vascular invasion (MAGE-A1, 41.5% vs 16.7%, P = 0.028; MAGE-A3, 49.1% vs 23.3%, P = 0.035) and, particularly, MAGE-A3, in patients with early vs advanced stage (36.5% vs 49.0%, P = 0.044), respectively. Patients expressing MAGE-A3 and NYESO- 1 were older than those not expressing MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1 (MAGE-A3, 73.7 ± 7.1 vs 67.4 ± 12.3, P = 0.009; NY-ESO-1, 75.5 ± 7.2 vs 68.8 ± 11.2, P = 0.042). CONCLUSION The KK-LC-1 expression rate was high even in patients with stage I cancer, suggesting that KK-LC-1 is a useful biomarker for early diagnosis of gastric cancer. © The Author(s) 2017.

The inherent complexity of the programs and discrepancies in the terminology used make it difficult to appreciate each of them distinctly and compare their specific strengths and weaknesses. To allow comparison and stimulate dialogue between different programs, we in this paper provide an overview of the German Cancer Society certification program for multidisciplinary cancer centers that was established in 2003. Main body: In the early 2000s the German Cancer Society assessed the available information on quality of cancer care in Germany and concluded that there was a definite need for a comprehensive, transparent and evidence-based system of quality assessment and control. This prompted the development and implementation of a voluntary cancer center certification program that was promoted by scientific societies, health-care providers, and patient advocacy groups and based on guidelines of the highest quality level (S3). The certification system structures the entire process of care from prevention to screening and multidisciplinary treatment of cancer and places multidisciplinary teams at the heart of this program. Within each network of providers, the quality of care is documented using tumor-specific quality indicators. The system started with breast cancer centers in 2003 and colorectal cancer centers in 2006. In 2017, certification systems are established for the majority of cancers. Here we describe the rationale behind the certification program, its history, the development of the certification requirements, the process of data collection, and the certification process as an example for the successful implementation of a voluntary but powerful system to ensure and improve quality of cancer care. Conclusion: Since 2003, over 1 million patients had their primary tumors treated in a certified center. There are now over 1200 sites for different tumor entities in four countries that have been certified in accordance with the program and transparently report their results from multidisciplinary treatment for a substantial proportion of cancers. This led to a fundamental change in the structure of cancer care in Germany and neighboring countries within one decade. © 2017 The Author(s).","Certification; Multidisciplinarity; Quality indicators; Quality of care",Article,Scopus

Vitamin D has antimicrobial and antiinflammatory effects. The capacity of vitamin D to inhibit inflammation also contributes to its antitumorigenic effect, as chronic inflammation is a major determinant of several cancers. Numerous chronic inflammatory diseases, such as pancreatitis, colitis, and hepatitis, are recognized risk factors for cancer of the pancreas, colon, and liver. Anticancer properties of vitamin D are most efficient in colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer.

These compounds regulate colon carcinoma cell gene expression, survival, differentiation, proliferation and invasion and inhibit angiogenesis and metastasis during colon cancer progression. Remarkably, in animal and in vitro models vitamin D compounds inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, whose aberrant activation initiates and maintains colon cancer. Moreover, recent data show that 1,25(OH)2D3 protects against colon cancer acting also on tumor stromal fibroblasts.

However, drugs are tested in clinical trials on genetically diverse patient populations. We show here that patient-to-patient variability and independent drug action are sufficient to explain the superiority of many FDA-approved drug combinations in the absence of drug synergy or additivity. This is also true for combinations tested in patient-derived tumor xenografts. In a combination exhibiting independent drug action, each patient benefits solely from the drug to which his or her tumor is most sensitive, with no added benefit from other drugs. Even when drug combinations exhibit additivity or synergy in pre-clinical models, patient-to-patient variability and low cross-resistance make independent action the dominant mechanism in clinical populations.

However, its expression pattern and clinicopathological relevance remain unclear. Materials and methods: A total of 114 lung cancer specimens were collected. The ZNF259 expression was measured between the lung cancer tissues and the adjacent normal lung tissues by immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. Moreover, the correlation of ZNF259 expression with clinicopathological features was analyzed in 114 cases of lung cancer. Additionally, ZNF259 was depleted in the lung cancer cells in order to analyze its effect in the lung cancer. Results: Immunohistochemical staining of 114 lung cancer specimens revealed significantly lower ZNF259 expression in lung cancer tissues than in adjacent normal lung tissues (53.5% vs 71.4%, P<0.001). In addition, ZNF259 downregulation was significantly associated with larger tumor size (P=0.001), advanced TNM stage (P=0.002), and positive lymph node metastasis (P=0.02). Western blotting of 20 paired lung cancer samples revealed lower ZNF259 protein levels in lung cancer tissues than in those of corresponding normal lung tissues (P=0.0032). Depletion of ZNF259 resulted in enhanced levels of p-FAK and p-AKT, CyclinD1, and MMP2, which in turn increased the proliferation and invasion of lung cancer cells. The effects of ZNF259 depletion were reversed by treatment with specific FAK or AKT inhibitors. Conclusion: ZNF259 depletion is correlated with the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and serves as a predictor of adverse clinical outcome in NSCLC patients. The inhibitory effect of ZNF259 on proliferation and invasion can be attributed to downregulation of CyclinD1 and MMP2 via inactivation of the FAK-AKT pathway. © 2017 Shan et al.","AKT signaling; FAK signaling; Invasion; NSCLC; Proliferation; ZNF259",Article,Scopus

However, very few high-quality studies have investigated this issue. In general, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) decreases following a bladder cancer diagnosis and continues for a prolonged period. HRQOL tends to decrease with increasing age and is associated with comorbid medical conditions. Among bladder cancer patients, QoL is not generally affected by treatment type. Overall QoL may also not differ according to diversion type, in radical cystectomy patients. However, one systematic review suggested that patients with orthotopic neobladders have superior emotional functioning and body image compared to those with ileal conduits. QoL studies involving non-muscle-invasive or metastatic bladder cancers are still very rare. By more completely understanding HRQOL issues, better treatment strategies may be chosen during informed decision-making.

Several approaches have been used to investigate this association, including using sun exposure as a proxy for vitamin D status, assessing vitamin D intake from food and supplements, using a predicted score to estimate vitamin D status, and directly measuring circulating 25(OH)D concentration. A variety of complementary study designs have been implemented with various strengths and limitations. Although definitive randomized control trial data are still lacking, there is mounting evidence from a number of observational studies for a protective relationship of vitamin D and cancer mortality, at least for some cancers. For cancer incidence, the evidence of an association with vitamin D deficiency is strongest for colorectal cancer. Some studies have investigated common variations and expression levels of vitamin D-related genes and their relationships to cancer mortality and prognosis in an effort to bolster causality. However, important questions remain about the dose-response/optimal levels required for the most benefit, the most relevant timing of exposure, whether tumor characteristics or lifestyle factors may modify the association, and the effectiveness of supplemental vitamin D or vitamin D analogs as adjuvant therapy options. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The present study was designed to test a natural MDM2 inhibitor, Inulanolide A (InuA), for anti-prostate cancer activity and to determine the underlying mechanism(s) of action. InuA directly bound to the RING domains of both MDM2 and MDMX with high affinity and specificity and disrupted MDM2-MDMX binding, markedly enhancing MDM2 protein degradation. We further discovered that InuA bound to the DNA binding domain of NFAT1, resulting in marked inhibition of MDM2 transcription. InuA inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer cells, regardless of their p53 status and AR responsiveness. Double knockdown of MDM2 and NFAT1 also revealed that the expression of both of these molecules is important for InuA's inhibitory effects on the proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells. In summary, InuA represents a novel class of bifunctional MDM2 inhibitors, and should be further investigated as a candidate lead compound for prostate cancer prevention and therapy. © 2017 Qin, Li, Wang, Zi and Zhang.","MDM2; MDMX; NFAT1; P53; Prostate cancer",Article,Scopus

This study is to evaluate the improved New-bioscore system for prediction as a new methodology of prognosis evaluation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer in China.METHODS A total of 495 patients with breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy from 08 July 2007 to 01 December 2013 were included. According to CPS + EG staging system (clinical-pathologic scoring system+estrogen receptor-negative disease and nuclear grade 3 tumor pathology, CPS+EG) and improved New-bioscore system (clinical-pathologic scoring system + estrogen receptor-negative disease and nuclear grade 3 tumor pathology+HER2 positive), each case was evaluated,followed by Kaplan Meier method to analyze the disease-specific survival (DSS) of breast cancer for different subgroups: clinical stage, pathologic stage, CPS+EG scores and improved new-bioscore.RESULTS The median follow-up time was 71 months. The five-year DSS rate for the entire study was 81% (95%CI: 77.08%-84.92%). The DSS rates were falling with the increased scores obtained from improved New-bioscore, The difference was statistically significant (χ 2 =34.618,P&lt;0.05). For breast cancer patients with clinical stage Ⅲ and pathologic stage Ⅲ and the patients who did not achieve pCR (non-pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the DSS rates was significantly lower as improved new-bioscore increase (χ 2 =33.018,P&lt;0.05). For breast cancer patients with HER2 either positive or negative, the DSS rates was significantly lower as improved new-bioscore increase (χ 2 =29.233,P&lt;0.05).According to the median improved New-bioscore scores, these cases were further divided into high-score group (&gt;3) and low-score group (≤ 3), and the DSS rates of high-score group were significantly lower than those of low-score group (χ 2 =43.201,P&lt;0.05). For breast cancer patients with clinical stage Ⅲ and pathologic stage Ⅲ and the patients who did not achieve pCR (non-pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the DSS rates of high-score group were significantly lower than those of low-score group (χ 2 =25.675,P&lt;0.05). For breast cancer patients with HER2 either positive or negative, the DSS rates of high-score group were significantly lower than those of low-score group (χ 2 =18.784,P&lt;0.05).CONCLUSIONS The improved new-bioscore is employed to further optimize the staging and prognosis evaluation of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. This is beneficial for patients to determine the follow-up intensive adjuvant therapy, improve the survival and avoid excessive or insufficient treatment, which provide a decent reference for customized treatment of each breast cancer patient. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

In addition, preclinical and epidemiologic data support the hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation could be a plausible path to genitourinary cancer prevention. Careful studies of vitamin D supplementation will likely be required to determine whether these biologic features can be translated into prevention strategies; similarly, despite several decades of study, there is only limited information regarding the potential role of vitamin D compounds in the treatment of established genitourinary tumors. Two components of further research in this area will be (1) studies of populations of patients to determine factors that may allow investigators to define the molecular characteristics of tumors that would allow investigators to chose those patients most likely to benefit from vitamin D-based therapies.

In addition to receptors for classic steroid hormones such as estrogen and progesterone, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and its ligand 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) modulate normal mammary gland development and sensitivity to carcinogenesis. Vitamin D deficiency is common in breast cancer patients and some evidence suggests that low vitamin D status enhances the risk for disease development or progression. Genomic profiling has characterized many 1,25(OH)2D3-responsive targets in normal mammary cells and in breast cancers providing insight into the molecular actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 and the VDR in regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, and differentiation. New areas of emphasis regarding the effects of vitamin D on breast cancer include its effects on tumor cell metabolism, the survival and outgrowth of stem cells, and the impact of obesity. Model systems of carcinogenesis have provided evidence that both VDR expression and 1,25(OH)2D3 actions change with transformation but clinical data regarding vitamin D responsiveness of established tumors is limited and inconclusive. Because breast cancer is heterogeneous, analysis of VDR actions in specific molecular subtypes of the disease may help to clarify the conflicting data.

The mean age of patients with CRC ranges from 49 to 60 years. Pediatric CRC is unusual, which often escapes early diagnosis because of a lack of awareness of its occurrence in children. The association between the mutation of APC and the occurrence of CRC in the first decade of life remains unknown. Case presentation: We report a 10-year-old child with CRC; he was diagnosed with stage IIIB advanced transverse colon cancer without distal metastases. We detected a heterozygous germline mutation at c.5465 T>A in both blood and tissue samples and a heterozygous somatic mutation at c.7397C>T in the tissue sample. Both of these mutations can cause CRC tumorigenesis in the first decade of life. Conclusions: The rare genetic features of this 10-year-old patient might be the predisposing cause of pediatric CRC.

METHODS A retrospective review of patients undergoing esophagectomy was performed and patients with cT1N0 and cT2N0 esophageal cancer by EUS were evaluated. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and treatment were reviewed. EUS staging was compared to surgical pathology to determine accuracy of EUS. Descriptive statistics was used to describe the cohort. Student's t test and Fisher's exact test or χ 2 test was used to compare variables. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine if clinical variables such as tumor location and tumor histology were associated with EUS accuracy. RESULTS Between 2000 and 2015, 139 patients with clinical stage ? or ? A esophageal cancer undergoing esophagectomy were identified. There were 25 (18%) female and 114 (82%) male patients. The tumor location included the middle third of the esophagus in 11 (8%) and lower third and gastroesophageal junction in 128 (92%) patients. Ninety-Three percent of patients had adenocarcinoma. Preoperative EUS matched the final surgical pathology in 73/139 patients for a concordance rate of 53%. Twenty-nine patients (21%) were under-staged by EUS; of those, 19 (14%) had unrecognized nodal disease. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used in addition to EUS for clinical staging in 62/139 patients. Occult nodal disease was only found in 4 of 62 patients (6%) in whom both EUS and PET were negative for nodal involvement. CONCLUSION EUS is less accurate in early EC and endoscopic mucosal resection might be useful in certain settings. The addition of PET to EUS improves staging accuracy. © The Author(s) 2017.

The contact between bladder tumors and urine suggests that urine should be a valuable source of biomarkers for diagnosis of bladder cancer. However, only a limited number of biomarkers have yet been used in clinical practice. Urinary cytology is undoubtedly effective for the detection of urothelial carcinomas, especially in high-grade cancer, but it has inherited limitation about the lower sensitivity. Other urinary biomarker assays that can be carried out in the clinic or laboratory each have strengths and weaknesses, and further validation will be needed before they can replace or fully complement urinary cytology. For routine use, these assays should reach quality criteria established by guidelines for the development of accurate biomarker tests. Therefore urologists and scientists should contribute to the standardization of detection techniques and conduct prospective randomized trials to determine the most appropriate urinary biomarkers for the detection of bladder cancer. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to evaluate the potential prognostic significance of SII in patients with advanced gastric cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Subjects and methods: The retrospective analysis included data from 107 patients with advanced gastric cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 185 patients with pathology-proven gastric cancer. The optimal cutoff value of SII by receiver operating characteristic curve stratified patients into low SII (&lt;600×109/L) and high SII (SII ≥600×109/L) groups. The clinical outcomes of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated by Kaplan–Meier survival curves and compared using log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze the prognostic value of SII. Results: The results indicated that SII had prognostic significance using the cutoff value of 600×109/L on DFS and OS in univariate and multivariate Cox regression survival analyses. Low SII was associated with prolonged DFS and OS, and the mean DFS and OS for patients with low SII were longer than for those with high SII (57.22 vs 41.56 months and 62.25 vs 45.60 months, respectively). Furthermore, we found that patients with low SII had better 1-, 3- and 5-year rates of DFS and OS than those with high SII. In addition, patients with low SII were likely to receive DFS and OS benefits from neoadjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative chemotherapy. Conclusion: SII may qualify as a noninvasive, cost-effective, convenient and reproducible prognostic indicator for patients with advanced gastric cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. It may help clinicians to identify those patients who will benefit from treatment strategy decisions. © 2017 Chen et al.","Gastric cancer; Inflammation index; Neoadjuvant chemotherapy; Prognosis; SII; Systemic immune",Article,Scopus

While the deregulated activation of DNMT1 or KIT has been implicated in lung cancer pathogenesis, whether and how DNMT1 and KIT orchestrate lung tumorigenesis are unclear. Here, using human lung cancer tissue microarrays and fresh frozen tissues, we found that the overexpression of DNMT1 is positively correlated with the upregulation of KIT in tumor tissues. We demonstrated that DNMT1 and KIT form a positive regulatory loop, in which ectopic DNMT1 expression increases, whereas targeted DNMT1 depletion abrogates KIT signaling cascade through Sp1/miR-29b network. Conversely, an increase of KIT levels augments, but a reduction of KIT expression ablates DNMT1 transcription by STAT3 pathway leading to in-parallel modification of the DNA methylation profiles. We provided evidence that KIT inactivation induces global DNA hypomethylation, restores the expression of tumor suppressor p15(INK4B) through promoter demethylation; in turn, DNMT1 dysfunction impairs KIT kinase signaling. Functionally, KIT and DNMT1 co-expression promotes, whereas dual inactivation of them suppresses, lung cancer cell proliferation and metastatic growth in vitro and in vivo, in a synergistic manner.

The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the response discrepancy to systemic chemotherapy of primary and corresponding metastasis lesions in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS Patients of advanced NSCLC complicated with intrapulmonary or corresponding mediastinal lymph nodes metastasis were admitted in this cohort between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2016. Totally 978 patients were considered eligible and platinum-based two-drug systemic chemotherapy regimens were undergone for two cycles. Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) was used to assess the shrink of both primary and metastasis lesions, and logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent impact factors of the response to systemic chemotherapy in both primary and corresponding metastasis lesions. RESULTS Our results indicated that the intrapulmonary (P=0.020) and mediastinal lymph nodes metastasis lesions got a better shrink (P<0.001) compared to primary lesion of these patients when undergone systemic chemotherapy. Univariate logistic analysis indicated that gender (OR=0.647, 95%CI=0.485-0.864, P=0.035), smoking (OR=1.326, 95%CI=1.014-1.773, P=0.046), histology of squamous (OR=0.646, 95%CI=0.493-0.844, P=0.002) also the location of primary lesion (OR=0.673, 95%CI=0.521-0.869, P=0.003) could influence the shrink discrepancy in primary and corresponding metastasis lesions, nevertheless, the multivariate logistic analysis demonstrated that the primary lesion only in central type carcinoma (P=0.028) as well asand the squamous carcinoma subgroups (P=0.026) as had a poorer response to systemic chemotherapy.

Our nationwide epidemiological study reveals that patients who continuously used disulfiram have a lower risk of death from cancer compared to those who stopped using the drug at their diagnosis. Moreover, we identify the ditiocarb-copper complex as the metabolite of disulfiram that is responsible for its anti-cancer effects, and provide methods to detect preferential accumulation of the complex in tumours and candidate biomarkers to analyse its effect on cells and tissues. Finally, our functional and biophysical analyses reveal the molecular target of disulfiram's tumour-suppressing effects as NPL4, an adaptor of p97 (also known as VCP) segregase, which is essential for the turnover of proteins involved in multiple regulatory and stress-response pathways in cells. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Accumulating evidence indicates that Vps34 may also contribute to the development and progression of human cancers. However, the mechanism of Vps34 in tumorigenesis remains elusive. Here, we report an unanticipated role of Vps34 in the activation of p62 for cancer development. We identified that Vps34 is a transcriptional activator of p62 through competition of Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) for Keap1 binding. Vps34 augments the association of PKC-δ with p62 for its phosphorylation at Serine 349, which leads to positive feedback on the Nrf2-dependent transcription of oncogenes. Additionally, we found that the expression of Vps34 is correlated with the tumorigenic activity of human breast cancer cells. Normally inactive in breast cancer, caspase 8 can cleave Vps34 at residue D285, which directly abolished its lipid kinase activity and dramatically altered cell invasion potential, colony formation, as well as tumorigenesis in orthotopic engraftments in mice. The cleavage at D285 blocks expression of LC3-II, Nrf2 and subsequently, p62, in addition to blocking tumor growth, indicating that the intact structure of Vps34 is essential for its activity. Moreover, either knockout of PKC-δ or knockdown of p62 by small interfering RNA in MCF-7 cells abrogates Vps34-dependent tumor growth. Data presented here suggested that Vps34 stimulates tumor development mainly through PKC-δ- activation of p62. © The Author(s) 2017.",,Article,Scopus

Cystoscopy remains the standard method for follow-up. When the first follow-up cystoscopy at 3 months after TURBT is negative, the following cystoscopies are traditionally repeated every 3 months for a period of 2 years, then every 6 months until the end of the fifth year, and yearly thereafter. This approach can now be tailored depending on individual risk of recurrence and progression. Low-risk patients can be discharged from cystoscopic follow-up after being free of recurrence for 5 years. In patients with a history of high-risk NMIBC including carcinoma in situ, urinary cytology should be used as an adjunct to cystoscopy with lifelong bladder follow-up and yearly upper tract imaging. Currently, urine markers have no adequate evidence-based role in the follow-up of NMIBC. A follow-up regimen for intermediate-risk patients is less clearly definable. It should be between low- and high-risk regimens according to the current guidelines.

In order to benefit more patients from cetuximab targeted therapy, this study aims to investigate the effect of simvastatin on resensitizing cetuximab-resistant human CRC cells in vitro. METHODS The KRAS mutant DLD-1 cells were randomly divided into four groups: normal, cetuximab (150μg/mL), simvastatin (0.2μg/mL) and cetuximab plus simvastatin. Then cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay; cell apoptosis was dectected by flow cytometry; cell cloning ability was determined by colony formation assay; cell invasion was detected by Transwell assay; the expressions of BRAF, p-ERK1/2, Bcl-xl, Bad, caspase-3 were determined by Western blot. RESULTS MTT assay showed that the proliferation rate of DLD-1 cells stimulated by four methods respectively were (100.00±0.00)%, (90.70±1.30)%,(88.00±0.60)% and (72.00±1.20)%. Simvastatin plus cetuximab contrasting to cetuximab alone could significantly reduce the cell proliferation, and there was great interactional effect between these two drugs, F=22.39,P<0.001. Colony formation showed that the cloning rate of cetuximab group and simvastatin plus cetuxiamb gruop were respectively (87.05±2.47)% and (52.28±1.51)%, F=197.86,P<0.001. Flow cytometry showed that simvastatin combined with cetuximab could significantly induce the cell apoptosis rate, which was increased from (9.36±0.33)% to (26.16±2.91)%, F=63.97,P<0.001. Transwell assay showed the invasion rate was significantly reduced when simvastatin combined with cetuximab, which was decreased from (127.45±17.06)% to (42.22±4.78)%, F=37.59, P<0.001. Western blot results showed that BRAF and p-ERK1/2 expressions were decreased, which inhibited the MAPK signaling pathway. The expressions of apoptosis protein such as Bcl-xl, procaspase-3 were down regulated, while Bad and Cleaved caspase-3 were up regulated. CONCLUSIONS Simvastatin combines with cetuximab may siginificantly inhibit the DLD-1 cell proliferation, colony formation and cell invasion, which may be related to the inhibition of MAPK signaling pathway, the activation of apoptosis related proteins and apoptosis induction. These may effectively reverse the cetuximab resistance. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

Endoscopic complete tumor removal and subsequent determination of completeness of TURBT, either via restaging TURBT or concomitant biopsies of the tumor bed, should be achieved. (2) Partial cystectomy for the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer has historically been maligned after several series reported high recurrence rates and poor oncologic outcomes. Partial cystectomy can be offered as an equally effective alternative to radical cystectomy in highly selected patients. (3) Bladder preservation strategies are considered effective methods with the potential to replace radical cystectomy for selected MIBC patients. One such bladder preservation strategy, chemotherapy, is generally not recommended as the only treatment method. To achieve complete response to treatment while maintaining bladder structure and function, it is important for urologists, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists to cooperatively administer multimodal treatments. (4) Organ conservation approaches have become the standard of care for numerous malignancies. During the past three decades, prospective clinical trials have established that bladder preservation therapy for select patients with MIBC is a safe and effective alternative to radical cystectomy.

However, radical cystectomy is complicated, and simultaneous surgery involves the genitourinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, and pelvic organs. Consequently, surgery-related complications frequently occur. However, the morbidity and mortality after radical cystectomy varies widely according to the reports. Therefore, organized systematic reporting system is necessary for comparing data from different hospitals and surgical techniques or from different patients. Today, the most common complications after radical cystectomy are bowel obstruction followed by infection such as acute pyelonephritis. Meanwhile, the main causes of mortality involved acute cardiopulmonary events, such as myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism. Sepsis following an infectious condition, originating from intestinal anastomotic or urinary leakage, was also associated with mortality. Survival after radical cystectomy is mainly determined by postoperative features. Postoperative pathological tumor stage, lymph node status, and margin status are the most valuable predictors of survival outcomes following cystectomy.

Methods: Ovarian cancer cell proliferation in vitro was evaluated using a CCK-8 assay. The resistance index of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells was determined and cell cycle and apoptosis rate determined by annexin V/propidium iodide double-staining in CP70 cells. Western blotting was used to determine IGF1, IGF1R, AKT, p-IGF1, p-IGF1R, p-AKT, and MRP2 levels in cells treated with different concentrations of metformin and LY29400, an inhibitor of the insulin-like growth factor pathway. Changes in gene expression levels of MRP2, IGF1, IGF1R, and AKT were determined by fluorescence real-time quantitative PCR assay of CP70 cells treated with metformin. Tumors of human ovarian cancer cell lines CP70 and A2780 were established by subcutaneous transplantation of cells in nude mice and the effect of metformin on MRP2 expression and tumor inhibition assessed. Results: The IC50 value of cisplatin in CP70 cells decreased significantly as metformin concentration increased (P &lt; 0.05). The cell cycle distribution in CP70 cells changed with metformin treatment; the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase, as well as the natural apoptosis rate was significantly increased with metformin treatment (P &lt; 0.05). IGF1, IGF1R, AKT p-IGF1, p-IGF1R, and p-Akt protein expression was enhanced dose-dependently with metformin, and was also significantly changed by treatment of CP70 cells with 0 mM metformin +10 mM LY294002. Moreover, changes in the expression of MRP2, IGF1, IGF1R, and AKT was metformin-concentration dependent, and was significantly different from that in the untreated control group (P &lt; 0.05). In nude mice, the tumor volumes of the cisplatin-treated groups were significantly less than in the control group, and was further suppressed by co-treatment with cisplatin and metformin (P &lt; 0.05), indicating that these 2 drugs had a synergistic effect on tumor inhibition. Conclusion: Metformin can improve the sensitivity of ovarian cancer CP70 cells to cisplatin in a concentration-dependent manner by activating the AKT signaling pathway, inhibiting the IGF1R signaling pathway, and reducing MRP2 expression. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cisplatin; DNA repair; Drug resistance; Hematoxylin and eosin staining; Immunohistochemistry; Insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway; Metformin; MRP2; Ovarian tumor; Tumor-inhibition rate",Article,Scopus

This study is to investigate the dosimetric characteristics of a hybrid irradiation technique which combines IMRT and VMAT in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. The aim is to reduce the irradiation dose volume of lung, prevent the occurrence of radiation-induced lung injury(RILI) and improve the quality of life of the patients. METHODS Hybrid-IMRT/VMAT, VMAT and IMRT plans were designed in each of 12 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent radiotherapy for the first course between August 1st, 2016 and May 31st, 2017 at the Department of Radiotherapy of Qinghai University Affiliated Hospital, and the prescription dose was 60Gy/30f. The H-IMRT/VMAT plan was compared with VMAT and IMRT to evaluate target dose distribution and OARs dose volume parameters. RESULTS The PTV homogeneity index (HI) of H-IMRT/VMAT, VMAT and IMRT were 0.077±0.014, 0.044±0.012 and 0.070±0.022(P&lt;0.001; P=0.082), and the PTV conformity index (CI) were 0.815±0.033, 0.846±0.041 and 0.811±0.039(P=0.012; P=0.814). The HI and CI of PTV of VMAT were the best, while H-IMRT/VMAT was equivalent to IMRT. H-IMRT/VMAT was better than the other two plans in lung protection. The mean lung dose (MLD), V 5 and V 10 of lung in H-IMRT/VMAT [(13.42±2.25) Gy, (55.47±10.75)% and (36.58±8.69)%] were better than that of VMAT [(14.56±2.36) Gy, (63.07±9.57)% and (47.62±8.92%)], the difference was statistically significant(P&lt;0.001; P=0.001), and V 20 of lung in H-IMRT/VMAT [(21.57±4.77)%] was superior to IMRT [(23.51±4.49)%], the difference was statistically significant (P=0.006). The V 30 , V 40 of lung and heart in H-IMRT/VMAT were not statistically different from those of the other two plans (P&gt;0.05). The Dmax of spinal cord in H-IMRT/VMAT [(34.54±6.60) Gy] was slightly lower than that in VMAT [(35.60±4.24) Gy], the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.303), and compared with IMRT [(36.19±5.63) Gy], the difference was statistically significant (P=0.038). CONCLUSION The target dose distribution of H-IMRT/VMAT plan is close to IMRT plan. Compared with VMAT and IMRT, H-IMRT/VMAT has obvious advantages in decreasing the low and middle dose areas (V 20 , V 10 , V 5 ) of lung and MLD, which can better pretect lung. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

This article summarizes the change before and after Radiofrequency and Microwave ablation of primary hepatic carcinoma patients and conduct thermal ablation effects on the immune function of patients with PHC. METHODS PubMed, Medline and CNKI have been employed to search for related literature published between 2001-01 and 2017-05 using terms of hepatocellular carcinoma, radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation and immune function. A total of 36 English papers and 10 Chinese papers were searched. Eligibility criteria: 1) body's normal anti-tumor immune response; 2) changes in the immune function of patients with PHC; 3)radiofrequency and microwave ablation of liver cancer; 4)ablation effects and related mechanisms on the immune function of patients with PHC. Forty-six pieces of eligible documents have been included into the investigation. RESULTS Radiofrequency and microwave ablation as representative of local minimally invasive treatments have been widely used in clinical practice. Compared with surgical resection, ablation therapy can not only directly inactivate tumor cells and destroy tumor tissues which causing irreversible coagulation necrosis, but also affect the expression of immune cells and cytokines after treatment. The ratio of CD4 + , CD4 + /CD8 + and NK cells after the treatment was higher than that of before treatment, and the difference was statistically significant; the ratio of CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T lymphocytes decreased, and the difference was statistically significant; at the same time, the proportion of Th1/Th2 of the helper T cells was adjusted, and the level of Th1 cytokines increased, the level of Th2 cytokines decreased, and the difference was statistically significant compared with the normal control group. CONCLUSION As local thermal ablation is used to treat tumors, it also can improve the tumor microenvironment, alleviate the inhibition of anti-tumor immunity, improve immune function, and reduce recurrence and metastasis. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

A number of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in cancer biology, including BC. Previous lncRNA profiling studies have focused only on triple-negative BC and HER 2-positive BC, and no studies have specifically focused on lncRNAs in ER-positive BC. In this study, we analyzed the expression profile of the lncRNAs and mRNAs found in this particular subtype of BC for the first time. Methods: We evaluated lncRNA microarray data from four pairs of primary BC and adjuvant nontumor breast tissues. Then, we screened out the differently expressed genes and measured the correlation of the expression levels of lncRNAs and ERalpha by Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis. We also performed classification and length distribution of the dysregulated lncRNAs. KEGG pathway analysis was used to understand the biological roles of these differently expressed genes. lncRNA–mRNA coexpression networks were constructed. Finally, RT-PCR was employed to validate the microarray analysis findings. Results: We screened out 2,178 differently expressed lncRNAs, and 13 lncRNAs were found to be associated with the ER expression level. Classification analysis showed that most lncRNAs belonged to intergenic lncRNA and were from 400 to 800 nt in length. Chromosome distribution showed that many of the lncRNAs were mapped to chromosome 1. In the pathway analysis, most of the genes were related to cancer-associated behaviors, such as p53 signaling pathway, cell cycle, focal adhesion, and ECM–receptor interaction. lncRNA–mRNA coexpression networks were constructed, and the lncRNAs related to ESR1, BRCA1, and BRCA2 in the two groups were significantly different. The RT-PCR results were consistent with the data obtained from the microarrays. Conclusion: These results provide useful information for exploring potential novel biomarkers as diagnosis and therapy targets for the clinical treatment of ER-positive BC. © 2017 Peng et al.","Breast cancer; Estrogen receptor; Long noncoding RNA",Article,Scopus

Chemotherapy has reached a plateau in the overall survival curve of about 10 months. Therefore, in last decade novel targeted approaches have been developed to extend survival of these patients, including antiangiogenic treatment. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway plays a dominant role in stimulating angiogenesis, which is the main process promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Bevacizumab (bev; Avastin®) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that neutralizes VEGF’s biologic activity through a steric blocking of its binding with VEGF receptor. Currently, bev is the only antiangiogenic agent approved for the first-line treatment of advanced or recurrent nonsquamous NSCLC in “bev-eligible” patients. The ineligibility to receive bev is related to its toxicity. In the pivotal trials of bev in NSCLC, fatal bleeding events including pulmonary hemorrhage were observed with rates higher in the chemotherapy-plus-bev group. Therefore, in order to reduce the incidence of severe pulmonary hemorrhage, numerous exclusion criteria have been characteristically applied for bev such as central tumor localization or tumor cavitation, use of anticoagulant therapy, presence of brain metastases, age of patients (elderly). Subsequent studies designed to evaluate the safety of bev have demonstrated that this agent is safe and well tolerated even in those patients subpopulations excluded from pivotal trials. This review outlines the current state-of-the-art on bev use in advanced NSCLC.

JTC-801 treatment also significantly inhibited invasion of HCT116 and HT-29 cells [(21±5) vs (43±3), N=3,t=6.54,P=0.002 8; (23±3) vs (40±2), t=8.17, P=0.001 2]. Flow cytometry results showed that JTC-801 promoted apoptosis of HCT116 and HT-29 cells [(13.74±0.42)% vs (4.73±0.33)%, t=29.23,P<0.001; (18.59±0.39) % vs (8.51±0.57)%, t=25.28,P<0.001], and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 decreased significantly, while the levels of pro-apoptotic protein Bax and Active Caspase3 were significantly increased (P<0.05). JTC-801 treatment also significantly inhibited the expression of p-Akt, p-mTOR and p70s6k protein (P<0.01).

An alternative to standard combination therapy is the use of bifunctional molecules where a single species can modulate multiple targets simultaneously. In this review, we discuss the development of hybrids, which combine structural features of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 with those of several other molecule classes, notably histone deacetylase inhibitors, saponogens, and bisphosphonates, resulting in molecules with improved properties toward models of cancer, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer's disease. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, recent meta-analyses also support the use of immediate PIC after TURBT in cases of suspected NMIBC, However, in real practice, the frequency of immediate postoperative PIC is low and is also subject to a large degree of disparity. Increased financial expense, lack of prepared equipment, and additional required settings including an operation room or recovery room, and mischaracterization of tumor state are the major causes of such disparity.

The schedule and methods of the follow-up should reflect the individual's clinical situation. After surgical treatment for MIBC the follow-up is based on the results of endoscopy, cytology, and computed tomography-urography. Patients with extravesical and node-positive disease should undergo the most intensive follow-up scheme because of the highest risk of recurrence associated. Following radical cystectomy, approximately 50% of the patients show tumor recurrence. A recurrence might be local and systemic, or might occur in the urethra or upper urinary tract. The follow-up of patients having risk factors for local or systemic recurrence would achieve maximum efficiency during the first 3 years. Monitoring of the urethra must be adapted to the risk factors for recurrence and continued for at least 5 years. The monitoring of the upper urinary tract should be continued lifetime. In case of bladder preservation treatment for MIBC, early endoscopy and imaging reassessment is required. Critical to good outcomes after bladder preservation surgery depend on appropriate patient selection. The oncological follow-up of MIBC is determined according to the tumor stage and grade, location, and the treatment modality administered, thus defining the risk of recurrence over time. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, they are sometimes ineffective due to patient co-morbidities, such as limited mobility, which limits patient participation. To address these shortcomings, we envision that cardiopulmonary function can be evaluated in the patient's environment using an inexpensive wearable device during routine physical activities. We present a cloud-connected mask that is fitted with CO2, O2, flow volume, and accelerometer sensors. The data collected from the device is transmitted to a cloud service, which facilitates utilization of various data mining algorithms for extraction of insights from the data. As a necessary first step toward cardiopulmonary function evaluation, we study automatic recognition of the user's physical activity from mask sensors data via an empirical analysis of several data representation and classification algorithms.

Recently, we reported that it could inhibit the growth of intestinal polyp in animals and in patients with the familial adenomatous polyposis by downregulating β-catenin signaling. However, the intracellular target mediating the effects of berberine remains elusive. Here, we provide evidence that berberine inhibits β-catenin function via directly binding to a unique region comprising residues Gln275, Arg316 and Arg371 in nuclear receptor retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα), where berberine concomitantly binding to and synergistically activating RXRα with 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), a natural ligand binding to the classical ligand-binding pocket of RXRα. Berberine binding promotes RXRα interaction with nuclear β-catenin, leading to c-Cbl mediated degradation of β-catenin, and consequently inhibits the proliferation of colon cancer cells. Furthermore, berberine suppresses the growth of human colon carcinoma xenograft in nude mice in an RXRα-dependent manner. Together, our study not only identifies RXRα as a direct protein target for berberine but also dissects their binding mode and validates that berberine indeed suppresses β-catenin signaling and cell growth in colon cancer via binding RXRα, which provide new strategies for the design of new RXRα-based antitumor agents and drug combinations. © The Author(s) 2017.",,Article,Scopus

SmgGDS undergoes nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, suggesting that it has both cytoplasmic and nuclear functions that promote cancer. Previous studies indicate that SmgGDS binds cytoplasmic small GTPases and promotes their trafficking to the plasma membrane. In contrast, little is known about the functions of SmgGDS in the nucleus, or how these nuclear functions might benefit cancer cells. Here we show unique nuclear localization and regulation of gene transcription pathways by SmgGDS. Strikingly, SmgGDS depletion significantly reduces expression of over 600 gene products that are targets of the DREAM complex, which is a transcription factor complex that regulates expression of proteins controlling the cell cycle. The cell cycle regulators E2F1, MYC, MYBL2 (B-Myb) and FOXM1 are among the DREAM targets that are diminished by SmgGDS depletion. E2F1 is well known to promote G1 cell cycle progression, and the loss of E2F1 in SmgGDS-depleted cells provides an explanation for previous reports that SmgGDS depletion characteristically causes a G1 cell cycle arrest. We show that SmgGDS localizes in nucleoli, and that RNAi-mediated depletion of SmgGDS in cancer cells disrupts nucleolar morphology, signifying nucleolar stress. We show that nucleolar SmgGDS interacts with the RNA polymerase I transcription factor upstream binding factor (UBF). The RNAi-mediated depletion of UBF diminishes nucleolar localization of SmgGDS and promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of SmgGDS, indicating that nucleolar sequestration of SmgGDS by UBF stabilizes SmgGDS protein. The ability of SmgGDS to interact with UBF and localize in the nucleolus is diminished by expressing DiRas1 or DiRas2, which are small GTPases that bind SmgGDS and act as tumor suppressors. Taken together, our results support a novel nuclear role for SmgGDS in protecting malignant cells from nucleolar stress, thus promoting cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis. © The Author(s) 2017.",,Article,Scopus

The interaction of DNA damage and inflammation is affected by the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling pathway. The IGF1R pathway has been reported to regulate autophagy, as well, but sometimes through a bidirectional context. Targeting the IGF1R-Autophagy crosstalk could represent a promising strategy for the development of new antiinflammatory and anticancer therapies, and may help for subjects suffering from MetS who are at increased risk of colorectal cancer. However, therapeutic responses to targeted therapies are often shortlived, since a signaling crosstalk of IGF1R with other receptor tyrosine kinases or autophagy exists, leading to acquired cellular resistance to therapy. From a pharmacological point of view, it is attractive to speculate that synergistic benefits could be achieved by inhibition of one of the key effectors of the IGF1R pathway, in parallel with the pharmacological stimulation of the autophagy machinery, but cautiousness is also required, because pharmacologic IGF1R modulation can initiate additional, sometimes unfavorable biologic effects. © The Author(s) 2017.

Here, we report that HBV leads to liver fibrosis and hepatocarcinogenesis through miR-30e targeting P4HA2. HBV transgenic mouse was treated by CCl4 to generate a model of liver fibrosis. A crucial enzyme catalyzing collagen formation, prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit α2 (P4HA2) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, western blotting or quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis. The function of HBV-modulated P4HA2 in hepatoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo was analyzed by EdU, MTT, colony-forming assay and animal transplantation assay. HBV transgenic mice exhibited more collagen deposition in liver after intraperitoneal injection of CCl4. P4HA2 was dramatically augmented in liver samples of HBV transgenic mice, clinical liver cirrhosis and liver cancer patients. Mechanistically, HBx was capable of inducing P4HA2 through suppressing miR-30e, in which miR-30e could target P4HA2 mRNA 3' untranslated region in liver cancer cells. HBx inhibited the miR-30e expression through increasing methylation of CpG islands in its promoter mediated by EZH2-formed complexes. Functionally, HBx-elevated P4HA2 enhanced the collagen deposition in the liver in vivo and in vitro, leading to liver fibrosis and liver cancer progression. In conclusion, HBx promotes the development of liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma through miR-30e targeting P4HA2 mRNA.

For internalized peptides, tagging is also often required for intracellular trafficking studies, although fluorophore conjugation has an impact on peptide binding, permeability, and localization. Herein, a strategy based on cysteine arylation with tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile (4F-2CN), which simultaneously cyclizes peptides and imparts fluorescence, is reported. The 4F-2CN cyclization of an M2 macrophage-targeting peptide yields, in a single step, a peptide with improved serum stability, intrinsic fluorescence, and increased binding affinity. In a murine breast cancer model, it is demonstrated that the intrinsic fluorescence from the cyclized peptide is sufficient for monitoring biodistribution by whole-organ fluorescence imaging and cell internalization by flow cytometry. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly defined. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying TCTP involved in cellular processes, we performed an affinity purification-based proteomic profiling to identify proteins interacting with TCTP in human cervical cancer HeLa cells. We found that a group of proteins involved in DNA repair are enriched in the potential TCTP interactome. Silencing TCTP by short hairpin RNA in breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells leads to the declined repair efficiency for DNA double-strand breaks on the GFP-Pem1 reporter gene by homologous recombination, the persistent activation and the prolonged retention of γH2AX and Rad51 foci following ionizing radiation. Reciprocal immunoprecipitations indicated that TCTP forms complexes with Rad51 in vivo, and the stability maintenance of Rad51 requires TCTP in MCF-7 cells under normal cell culture conditions. Moreover, inactivation of TCTP by sertraline treatment enhances UVC irradiation-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, and causes sensitization to DNA-damaging drug etoposide and DNA repair inhibitor olaparib. Thus, we have identified an important role of TCTP in promoting DNA double-stand break repair via facilitating DNA homologous recombination processes and highlighted the great potential of TCTP as a drug target to enhance conventional chemotherapy for cancer patients with high levels of TCTP expression. © The Author(s) 2017.",,Article,Scopus

METHODS Livin and PTEN were determined by Western blot in 31 cases of prostate carcinoma tissue and 18 cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue, which were collected in Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University between 2015-3-12 and 2016-10-15.Immunohistochemistry(SP method) was also applied to detect the expression of Livin and PTEN protein in prostate carcinoma and to study the correlation between the Livin and PTEN. The association between the expression levels of Livin, PTEN and the clinicopathological characteristics were studied. RESULTS The expressions of Livin protein were significantly higher in prostate carcinoma than those in the benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue (2.16±0.83 vs 1.43±0.74, t=3.085, P=0.003). The expressions of PTEN protein were significantly lower in prostate carcinoma than those in the benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue (1.33±0.88 vs 2.13±1.51, t=-2.351, P=0.023).The level of Livin and PTEN were close related to clinical stage and metastasis; but have no correlation with gender, tumor location, differentiation degree and PSA. The Livin protein was highly expressed in prostate carcinoma tissue.The PTEN protein was lower expressed in prostate carcinoma tissue. The expression of Livin had negative correlation with the expression of PTEN(OR=0.0392,P=0.0003). CONCLUSION The over expression of Livin and the low expression of PTEN in prostate carcinoma tissue are closed related to clinical stage and metastasis. The low expression of PTEN in prostate carcinoma tissue had negative correlation with the expression of Livin. The negative correlation between Livin and PTEN indicates that they are related to each other in carcinogenesis.The Livin and PTEN may play important roles in occurrence and development of prostate cancer. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

Conventional wisdom was that damaging agents were indiscriminate and it was statistical bad luck, coupled with evolutionary selection, that drove mutational signatures after exposure of DNA to damaging agents. Recent data, however, suggests that primary DNA damage itself does not drive mutational signatures; instead, it is the selectivity of repair pathways on different regions of the genome that is decisive. In particular, genomic regions shielded by transcription factors or packed densely in nucleosomes are poorly repaired by nucleotide excision repair and are far more susceptible to mutation. There are plenty of approved therapies, the mode-of-action of which is to alkylate DNA, and although historically efforts have been focused on understanding how chemicals modify DNA, these new findings suggest that focus should be shifted to understanding genome-wide repair specificities when different types of alkylation damage occur. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The lack of high-penetrance susceptibility variants, the low-estimated heritability (~12%), and the existence of heterogeneous phenotypes, among others, have impeded the testing of high-risk populations and the screening of the whole population.In spite of those challenges, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified several loci in a hypothesis-free manner and pin-pointing to novel genes involved in UBC susceptibility. In addition, GWAS also confirmed that NAT2 slow acetylator and GSTM1-null genotypes are associated with elevated UBC risk. Most of the variants identified in GWAS are common and confer small risk and, therefore, they are not clinically actionable at the individual level. There are suggestive evidences indicating that UBC genetic susceptibility may differ according to UBC subtypes. Importantly, it has been reported that some UBC genetic factors interact with nongenetic factors (i.e., smoking) contributing to UBC development. There is also evidence of a genetic component affecting UBC clinical course. However, no genetic variant has shown association at the genome-wide significance level and a limited role of genetics on prognosis prediction has been proven up to date. Larger studies and more homogeneous studies with long follow-up are needed to definitively answer conclude on the prognostic role of genetic variants in UBC. The aim of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive overview of the genetic susceptibility to UBC risk and prognosis. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, the molecular signals that control T RM cell differentiation and homeostasis are not fully understood. Here we show that mouse T RM precursor cells represent a unique CD8 + T cell subset that is distinct from the precursors of circulating memory cell populations at the levels of gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Using computational and pooled in vivo RNA interference screens, we identify the transcription factor Runx3 as a key regulator of T RM cell differentiation and homeostasis. Runx3 was required to establish T RM cell populations in diverse tissue environments, and supported the expression of crucial tissue-residency genes while suppressing genes associated with tissue egress and recirculation. Furthermore, we show that human and mouse tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes share a core tissue-residency gene-expression signature with T RM cells that is associated with Runx3 activity. In a mouse model of adoptive T cell therapy for melanoma, Runx3-deficient CD8 + tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes failed to accumulate in tumours, resulting in greater rates of tumour growth and mortality. Conversely, overexpression of Runx3 enhanced tumour-specific CD8 + T cell abundance, delayed tumour growth, and prolonged survival. In addition to establishing Runx3 as a central regulator of T RM cell differentiation, these results provide insight into the signals that promote T cell residency in non-lymphoid sites, which could be used to enhance vaccine efficacy or adoptive cell therapy treatments that target cancer. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

SETD2 mutations led to resistance to DNA-damaging agents, cytarabine, 6-thioguanine, doxorubicin, and etoposide, but not to a non–DNA damaging agent, L-asparaginase.

METHODS An azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)- induced colitis mouse model was established. Fortytwo female FVB/N mice were randomly divided into the following three groups: group 1 (10 mice, negative control) was treated with vehicle, group 2 (16 mice, positive control) was treated with AOM plus vehicle, and group 3 (16 mice, EG) was treated with AOM plus EGCG. For aberrant crypt foci (ACF) evaluation, the colons were rapidly took out after sacrifice, rinsed with saline, opened longitudinally, laid flat on a polystyrene board, and fixed with 10% buffered formaldehyde solution before being stained with 0.2% methylene blue in saline. For tumor evaluation, the colon was macroscopically inspected and photographed, then the total number of tumors was enumerated and tumor size measured. For histological examination, the fixed tissues were paraffin-embedded and sectioned at 5 mm thickness. Microbial genomic DNA was extracted from fecal and intestinal content samples using a commercial kit. The V4 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA were PCR-Amplified with the barcoded fusion primers. Using the best hit classification option, the sequences from each sample were aligned to the RDP 16S rRNA training set to classify the taxonomic abundance in QIIME. Statistical analyses were then performed. RESULTS Treatment of mice with 1% EGCG caused a significant decrease in the mean number of ACF per mouse, when compared with the model mice treated with AOM/DSS (5.38 ± 4.24 vs 13.13 ± 3.02, P < 0.01). Compared with the positive control group, 1% EGCG treatment dependently decreased tumor load per mouse by 85% (33.96 ± 6.10 vs 2.96 ± 2.86, respectively, P < 0.01). All revealed that EGCG could inhibit colon carcinogenesis by decreasing the number of precancerous lesions as well as solid tumors, with reduced tumor load and delayed histological progression of CRC. During the cancerization, the diversity of gut microbiota increased, potential carcinogenic bacteria such as Bacteroides were enriched, and the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria (Clostridiaceae , Ruminococcus , etc .) decreased continuously. In contrast, the structure of gut microbiota was relatively stable during the intervention of EGCG on colon carcinogenesis. Enrichment of probiotics (Bifidobacterium , Lactobacillu , etc .) might be a potential mechanism for EGCG's effects on tumor suppression. Via bioinformatics analysis, principal coordinate analysis and cluster analysis of the tumor formation process, we found that the diversity of gut microbiota increased in the tumor model group while that in the EGCG interfered group (EG) remained relatively stable. CONCLUSION Gut microbiota imbalance might be a potential mechanism for the prevention of malignant transformation by EGCG, which is significant for diagnosis, treatment, prognosis evaluation, and prevention of colorectal cancer. © The Author(s) 2017.

METHODS A type of microbubbles carrying oxygen which used the DSPC and DPPE-MPEG 5000 as shell was producted by mechanic vibration. Cholangiocarcinoma cell lines (QBC939 and RBE) were cultured in vitro under chemical hypoxia induced by CoCl 2 (150umol/L),we changed hypoxic microenvironment of cholangiocarcinoma cells by ultrasound-mediated destruction of oxygen loaded lipid microbubbles. The cell growth of each group was detected by MTT,the apoptosis and cell cycle were detected by flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS The oxygen-loaded microbubbles appeared as a uniform size with a mean diameter of 1.91 μm and oxygen concentration of (2.57±0.82) × 10 -3 mg / mL. Comparing with the control group, the proliferation of QBC939 and RBE in the hypoxic microenvironment which induced by CoCl 2 was increased significantly, the two groups (control group, CoCl 2 group) showed different A (1.91±0.07 and 1.67±0.04, t=-7.855,P=0.0014; 2.81±0.04 and 1.84±0.04,t=-30.514,P=0.0001),but the ultrasound-mediated destruction of oxygen loaded lipid microbubbles effectively inhibited the proliferation(P&lt;0.05) and significantly promoted apoptosis of QBC939 and RBE cells in time and dose dependent patterns(P&lt;0.05).The results of cell cycle revealed that the number of cells in S-phase was increased significantly (P&lt;0.05), however, there was no significant difference between the hypoxia group and microbubble group. CONCLUSIONS The hypoxia microenvironment can promote the growth of cholangiocarcinoma cell Lines, and ultrasound-mediated destruction of oxygen-loaded lipid microbubbles can inhibite the proliferation and promote apoptosis effectively by correcting the hypoxia microenvironment, which is not associated with the arrest of cell cycle. © 2017, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

Here, we demonstrate that mTORC1 promotes lipid biogenesis via SRPK2, a key regulator of RNA-binding SR proteins. mTORC1-activated S6K1 phosphorylates SRPK2 at Ser494, which primes Ser497 phosphorylation by CK1. These phosphorylation events promote SRPK2 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of SR proteins. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis reveals that lipid biosynthetic enzymes are among the downstream targets of mTORC1-SRPK2 signaling. Mechanistically, SRPK2 promotes SR protein binding to U1-70K to induce splicing of lipogenic pre-mRNAs. Inhibition of this signaling pathway leads to intron retention of lipogenic genes, which triggers nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SRPK2 blunts de novo lipid synthesis, thereby suppressing cell growth. These results thus reveal a novel role of mTORC1-SRPK2 signaling in post-transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism and demonstrate that SRPK2 is a potential therapeutic target for mTORC1-driven metabolic disorders. An mTOR-dependent pathway is a key post-transcriptional regulator of lipogenic enzymes that are involved in tumor growth. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","cancer metabolism; CK1; de novo lipid synthesis; mTOR; nonsense-mediated decay; RNA splicing; RNA stability; S6K1; SR proteins; SRPK2",Article,Scopus

The factors that predispose individuals are not completely understood. Both genetics and environmental factors play a role in the development of IBD. IBD is more prevalent in northern than southern regions of North America and Europe. Vitamin D is an important regulator of the immune system; patients with IBD are frequently vitamin D deficient and vitamin D-deficient animals have increased susceptibility to IBD. The autoimmune response in IBD is suppressed by active metabolites of vitamin D. There is no cure for IBD. Immunosuppressive drugs are used to suppress the intestinal inflammation in patients with IBD, but these drugs are extremely expensive and increase the risk of infection and cancer.

To identify a gene expression–based classification of myelodysplasia with biological and clinical relevance, we performed a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of myeloid neoplasms with dysplasia using transcriptome sequencing. Unsupervised clustering of gene expression data of bone marrow CD341 cells from 100 patients identified 2 subgroups. The first subtype was characterized by increased expression of genes related to erythroid/megakaryocytic (EMK) lineages, whereas the second subtype showed upregulation of genes related to immature progenitor (IMP) cells. Compared with the first so-called EMK subtype, the IMP subtype showed upregulation of many signaling pathways and downregulation of several pathways related to metabolism and DNA repair. The IMP subgroup was associated with a significantly shorter survival in both univariate (hazard ratio [HR], 5.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-14; P 5 .002) and multivariate analysis (HR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.3-19; P 5 .02). Leukemic transformation was limited to the IMP subgroup. The prognostic significance of our classification was validated in an independent cohort of 183 patients. We also constructed a model to predict the subgroups using gene expression profiles of unfractionated bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs). The model successfully predicted clinical outcomes in a test set of 114 patients with BMMNC samples. The addition of our classification to the clinical model improved prediction of patient outcomes.

We established that three major flavonolignans: silybin, silychristin and silydianin, in concentrations of up to 100 μM, have neither a cytotoxic nor genotoxic effect on blood platelets, PMBCs and A549. We also saw that silybin and silychristin have a protective effect on cellular mitochondria, observed as a reduction of spontaneous mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage in A549, measured as mtDNA copies, and mtDNA lesions in ND1 and ND5 genes.

However, the proportion of Th17 and Treg subsets increased significantly compared with control group,(4.53±0.18 vs 2.48±0.38)% and(11.24±0.64 vs 8.41±0.25)%,P&lt;0.05. The Treg/Th17 paradigm shifted to Th17 in irradiated model mice,the ratio was significantly lower than that in control group(2.54±0.14 vs 3.28±0.12). In addition, the mRNA expression levels of IL-17A, TGF-β, IL-23 were increased significantly (P&lt;0.01). After SC administration, in comparison with irradiated model group, the proportion of Th17 and Treg cells experienced significant decreased, P values were 0.002 and 0.024. With decreasing of Th17,the Treg/Th17 ratio showed marked growth (P&lt;0.01). Moreover, the mRNA expressions of IL-17A, TGF-β, IL-23 were decreased significantly (P&lt;0.01).

The susceptibility of target cancer cells to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity depends on the strength and balance of regulatory (activating/inhibitory) ligands expressed on target cell surface. We performed gene expression arrays to determine patterns of NK cell ligands associated with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (b-NHL). Microarray analyses revealed significant upregulation of a multitude of NK-activating and costimulatory ligands across varied b-NHL cell lines and primary lymphoma cells, including ULBP1, CD72, CD48, and SLAMF6. To correlate genetic signatures with functional anti-lymphoma activity, we developed a dynamic and quantitative cytotoxicity assay in an integrated microfluidic droplet generation and docking array. Individual NK cells and target lymphoma cells were co-encapsulated in picoliter-volume droplets to facilitate monitoring of transient cellular interactions and NK cell effector outcomes at single-cell level. We identified significant variability in NK-lymphoma cell contact duration, frequency, and subsequent cytolysis. Death of lymphoma cells undergoing single contact with NK cells occurred faster than cells that made multiple short contacts. NK cells also killed target cells in droplets via contact-independent mechanisms that partially relied on calcium-dependent processes and perforin secretion, but not on cytokines (interferon-γ or tumor necrosis factor-a). We extended this technique to characterize functional heterogeneity in cytolysis of primary cells from b-NHL patients. Tumor cells from two diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients showed similar contact durations with NK cells; primary Burkitt lymphoma cells made longer contacts and were lysed at later times. We also tested the cytotoxic efficacy of NK-92, a continuously growing NK cell line being investigated as an antitumor therapy, using our droplet-based bioassay. NK-92 cells were found to be more efficient in killing b-NHL cells compared with primary NK cells, requiring shorter contacts for faster killing activity. Taken together, our combined genetic and microfluidic analysis demonstrate b-NHL cell sensitivity to NK cell-based cytotoxicity, which was associated with significant heterogeneity in the dynamic interaction at single-cell level. © 2017 Sarkar, Sabhachandani, Ravi, Potdar, Purvey, Beheshti, Evens and Konry.","Dynamic analysis; Lymphoma; Microfluidic system; Natural killer cell cytotoxicity; Non-Hodgkin; Single cell",Article,Scopus

Most of the reported cases have been treated with surgery, obtaining a long survival outcome. Here, we report the case of a 31-year-old Caucasian man who underwent surgery at our institution for a large, lobulated, multinodular mass of the right hemi-liver. The histological exam confirmed the diagnosis of NSET. After 6 mo from surgery, a liver recurrence was described and a chemoembolization was performed. After a further disease progression, based on the correlation between the histological features of the disease and those of the hepatoblastoma, a similar chemotherapy regimen (with cisplatin and ifosfamide/mesna chemotherapy, omitting doxorubicin due to liver impairment) was administered. However, infection of the biliary catheter required a dose modification of the treatment. No benefit was noted and a progression of disease was radiologically assessed after only four cycles. The worsening of the clinical status prevented further treatments, and the patient died a few months later. This case report documents how the NSET might have an aggressive and non-preventable behavior. No chemotherapy schedules with a proved efficacy are available, and new data are needed to shed light on this rare neoplasm. © The Author(s) 2017. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

They also exist in normal physiology. Aging is often characterized by deregulation of molecular and cellular mechanisms, including loss of heterochromatin, increased transcriptional noise, less tight control on alternative splicing, and more stress-induced changes. It is thus assumed that chimeric RNAs are more abundant in older people. In this study, we conducted a preliminary investigation to identify any chimeric RNAs with age-based trends in their expression levels in blood samples. A chimeric RNA candidate list generated by bioinformatic analysis indicated the possibility of both negative and positive trends in the expression of chimeric RNAs. Out of this candidate list, five novel chimeric RNAs were successfully amplified in multiple blood samples and then sequenced. Although primary smaller sample sizes displayed some weak trends with respect to age, analysis of quantitative PCR data from larger sample sizes showed essentially no relationship between expression levels and age. Altogether, these results indicate that, contradictory to the common assumption, chimeric RNAs as a group are not all higher in older individuals and that placing chimeric RNAs in the context of aging will be a much more complex task than initially anticipated. © 2017 by the authors.

As GPCRs can be activated by an extensive range of factors including hormones, neurotransmitters, phospholipids and other stimuli, their involvement in a plethora of physiological functions is not surprising. Aberrant GPCR signaling has been regarded as a major contributor to diverse pathologic conditions, such as inflammatory, cardiovascular and neoplastic diseases. In this regard, solid tumors have been demonstrated to activate an angiogenic program that relies on GPCR action to support cancer growth and metastatic dissemination. Therefore, the manipulation of aberrant GPCR signaling could represent a promising target in anticancer therapy. Here, we highlight the GPCR-mediated angiogenic function focusing on the molecular mechanisms and transduction effectors driving the patho-physiological vasculogenesis. Specifically, we describe evidence for the role of heptahelic receptors and associated G proteins in promoting angiogenic responses in pathologic conditions, especially tumor angiogenesis and progression.

The kinetics of ligand exchange around platinum plays a crucial role in the activity of platinum complexes. Aquation of cisplatin to cis-[Pt(NH3)2(H2O)Cl]+ is usually the first step in cisplatin binding to DNA.

Aquated platinum(II) species are produced more slowly from carboplatin and oxaliplatin as the ring opening of carboxylate is a very slow process compared with the easy hydrolysis of cisplatin. Therefore, in these cases it is predicted that the reaction of the platinum drug with DNA would proceed by a direct attack of guanine on platinum. The kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of aquation of platinum drugs and Pt-DNA interaction have been widely studied. In particular, the use of NMR spectroscopy has facilitated in exploring the basic steps of these reactions. The hydrogen bond donating capacity of DNA bases to the platinum ligands stabilizes the transition state for monoadduct formation and thus enhances the rate of platination. Theoretical investigations suggest a trigonal bipyramidal transition state for the substitution reactions. The present review highlights some important findings obtained from the kinetic studies of platinum anticancer agents and describes various theoretical aspects of platinum binding to DNA. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Anticancer agents; Aquation; DNA interaction; Kinetics; Platinum",Review,Scopus

Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SCNTs) served as supports for aptamers and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and then the modified SCNTs were utilized as electrochemical probes. The aptamer contains phosphate groups, while ALP can hydrolyse one molecular pyrophosphate into two molecular phosphate ions. The phosphate can react with molybdate to form a redox-active molybdophosphate precipitate on the surface of the glassy carbon electrode (GCE). With applying a relatively low voltage of 0.21 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), the generated electrochemical current intensity is proportional to the concentration of the analyte. The cancer biomarker platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) was chosen as a model antigen (analyte). The immunosensor was prepared by sequential capturing of the antibodies against PDGF-BB, analyte (PDGF-BB) and modified SCNTs on the GCE to form a sandwich structure. The current signal is linear in the concentration range of 0.1 pg mL -1 to 50 ng mL -1 PDGF-BB, with a detection limit as low as 50 fg mL -1 . The immunosensor was finally applied in the determination of PDGF-BB concentration in serum samples. Our perception is that this signal amplification strategy can be adapted to the preparation of other immunosensors and will find wide applications in the detection of different biomarkers and related species. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Article,Scopus

They contribute to the overall synthesis of evidence for a specific association, which should also include the evaluation of studies that provide mechanistic insights, including in vitro investigations, animal studies, and human experimental studies, on intermediate factors for the end point of interest. Causality can only be definitively established in interventional studies, typically a double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT), but such RCTs are not always available or feasible, and even when available, RCTs have their own limitations. Observational studies are critical when very large numbers are required, and the end point is affected by long-term vitamin D status, such as over decades, or of vitamin D status in the remote past. Prospective studies, for which vitamin D is assessed before the outcome of interest, are less prone to some biases that may occur in retrospective studies. Vitamin D status may be estimated in various ways, but a measure of circulating 25(OH)vitamin D (25(OH)D) is generally considered optimal. Yet, such a measure has some limitations, including that a single measure may not always adequately capture long-term vitamin D status, and a measure can be prone to certain kinds of confounding. For example, it is plausible that endogenous pathophysiologic process such as systemic inflammation could lower 25(OH)D concentrations. Recently, Mendelian randomization, which utilizes genetic variation of 25(OH)D concentrations, has contributed to our understanding of vitamin D and disease. This chapter provides an overview of the main considerations regarding biases and confounding that should be given to observational studies of various types of designs and measures or vitamin D status. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic schwannoma is challenging due to its tendency to mimic other lesions of the pancreas. We describe a case of pancreatic schwannoma and present a review of the cases currently reported in the English literature to identify characteristics of pancreatic schwannoma on imaging. Case presentation: A 53-year-old male presented with a history of intermittent periumbilical abdominal pain and lower back pain for 1 week. Based on ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) findings, we made a preoperative diagnosis of solid pseudopapillary tumor and performed a standard pancreaticoduodenectomy. Pathological examination showed that the tumor was composed of spindle cells with a palisading arrangement, and immunohistochemistry revealed strong positive staining for S-100 protein, which was consistent with a diagnosis of pancreatic schwannoma. At the 8-month follow-up visit, the patient was doing well without recurrent disease, and his abdominal pain had resolved. Conclusions: Although pancreatic schwannoma is rare, it should be included in the list of differential diagnoses of pancreatic masses, both solid and cystic. A tumor size larger than 6.90 cm, vascular encasement, or visceral invasion should elicit suspicion of malignant transformation. © 2017 The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Wong Baker and Hicks Facial Pain Scale is one of the most commonly used method. Clinicians grade pain according to the facial mimetic reaction of the patient. Unfortunately, there is no objective measure for monitoring pain. By using the same principle of the Wong Baker and Hicks Facial Pain Scale, in this study, we aimed to objectively measure pain by using a thermal camera to detect instant facial temperature changes. Materials and methods: Thirty volunteers who attended blood collection unit were subjected to facial thermal monitoring and measurements were obtained 5 minutes before needle puncture (BNP), during needle puncture (DNP), and after needle puncture (ANP). Data were processed with TestoIRSoft 3.8 software program and mean temperatures of the whole face (FFM) and highest temperature points (HP), horizontal line (HOR) between two pupils and first glabellar wrinkle, and bilateral lines starting from the nasolabial sulcus to oral commissure (NLS-1 at right, NLS-2 at left) were evaluated. All data were statistically analyzed with paired sample t-test. Results: Statistically, temperature measurements of HOR, NLS-1, NLS-2, HP, and FFM were significantly higher between BNP and DNP, significantly lower between ANP and DNP, and significantly higher between BNP and ANP (p<0.05). The most interesting result in our analysis was that the HP point was between the two eyebrows in 26 of the 30 volunteers. Conclusion: Our results suggest that a thermal camera can be used to objectively monitor pain and in follow-up. However, further studies involving non-healthy volunteers (especially highfever patients, children, immunosuppressive patients, and cancer and intensive care patients) should be performed. © 2017 Erel and Özkan.","Analgesia; Facial temperature; Pain; Thermal camera",Article,Scopus

However, large interventional studies with antioxidants failed to show benefits in the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, or diabetes mellitus. Numerous clinical studies have confirmed the association of oxidative stress markers and periodontitis. Technical and biological variability is high for most of the analyzed markers and none of them seems to be optimal for routine clinical use. In a research setting, analysis of a palette of oxidative stress markers is needed to cover lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and the antioxidant status. The source of reactive oxygen species and their role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis remains unclear. Interventional experiments indicate that oxidative stress might be more than just a simple consequence of the inflammation. Small studies have confirmed that some antioxidants could have therapeutic value at least as an addition to the standard non-surgical treatment of periodontitis. A clear evidence for the efficiency of antioxidant treatment in large patient cohorts is lacking. Potentially, because lowering of oxidative stress markers might be a secondary effect of anti-inflammatory or antibacterial agents. As the field of research of oxidative stress in periodontitis gains attraction and the number of relevant published papers is increasing a systematic overview of the conducted observational and interventional studies is needed. This review summarizes the currently available literature linking oxidative stress and periodontitis and points toward the potential of adjuvant antioxidant treatment, especially in cases where standard treatment fails to improve the periodontal status. © 2017 Tóthová and Celec.","Antioxidative therapy; Free radicals; Oral diseases; Reactive oxygen species; Systematic review",Short Survey,Scopus

The currently licensed antiviral drugs are not very effective and prone to viral resistance. Thus, novel effective and broadly active drugs are urgently needed. We have identified the cellular Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade as crucial for IAV replication and suitable target for an antiviral intervention. Since this signaling cascade is aberrantly activated in many human cancers, several clinically approved inhibitors of Raf and MEK are now available. Here we explored the anti-IAV action of the licensed B-RafV600E inhibitor Vemurafenib. Treatment of B-RafWT cells with Vemurafenib induced a hyperactivation of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade rather than inhibiting its activation upon IAV infection. Despite this hyperactivation, which has also been confirmed by others, Vemurafenib still strongly limited IAV-induced activation of other signaling cascades especially of p38 and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Most interestingly, Vemurafenib inhibited virus-induced apoptosis via impaired expression of apoptosis-inducing cytokines and led to hampered viral protein expression most likely due to the decreased activation of p38 and JNK MAPK. These multiple actions resulted in a profound and broadly active inhibition of viral replication, up to a titer reduction of three orders of a magnitude. Thus, while Vemurafenib did not act similar to MEK inhibitors, it displays strong antiviral properties via a distinct and multi-target mode of action. © 2017 Holzberg, Boergeling, Schräder, Ludwig and Ehrhardt.","Apoptosis; Influenza A virus; MAP kinases; Raf/MEK/ERK cascade; Signal transduction pathways; Vemurafenib",Article,Scopus

ARs are classified into four subtypes, A1, A2A, A2B, and A3, which are all activated by extracellular adenosine, and play central roles in a broad range of physiological processes, including sleep regulation, angiogenesis and modulation of the immune system. ARs are potential therapeutic targets in a variety of pathophysiological conditions, including sleep disorders, cancer, and dementia, which has made them important targets for structural biology. Over a decade of research and innovation has culminated with the publication of more than 30 crystal structures of the human adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR), making it one of the best structurally characterized GPCRs at the atomic level. In this review we analyze the structural data reported for A2AR that described for the first time the binding of mode of antagonists, including newly developed drug candidates, synthetic and endogenous agonists, sodium ions and an engineered G protein. These structures have revealed the key conformational changes induced upon agonist and G protein binding that are central to signal transduction by A2AR, and have highlighted both similarities and differences in the activation mechanism of this receptor compared to other class A GPCRs. Finally, comparison of A2AR with the recently solved structures of A1R has provided the first structural insight into the molecular determinants of ligand binding specificity in different AR subtypes. © 2017 Carpenter and Lebon.","Adenosine; Drugs; G protein; GPCR; Structural biology; X-ray diffraction",Review,Scopus

T-cell therapies are a promising approach for treating MM, with a mechanism of action different than those of standard MM treatments. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are fusion proteins incorporating antigen-recognition domains and T-cell signaling domains. T cells genetically engineered to express CARs can specifically recognize antigens. Success of CAR-T cells (CAR-Ts) against leukemia and lymphoma has encouraged development of CAR-T therapies for MM. Target antigens for CARs must be expressed on malignant cells, but expression on normal cells must be absent or limited. B-cell maturation antigen is expressed by normal and malignant plasma cells. CAR-Ts targeting B-cell maturation antigen have demonstrated significant antimyeloma activity in early clinical trials. Toxicities in these trials, including cytokine release syndrome, have been similar to toxicities observed in CAR-T trials for leukemia. Targeting postulated CD191 myeloma stem cells with anti-CD19 CAR-Ts is a novel approach to MM therapy. MM antigens including CD138, CD38, signaling lymphocyte–activating molecule 7, and k light chain are under investigation as CAR targets. MM is genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous, so targeting of &gt;1 antigen might often be required for effective treatment of MM with CAR-Ts. Integration of CAR-Ts with other myeloma therapies is an important area of future research.

However, uptake of these vaccines has been suboptimal, with many people holding negative beliefs and misconceptions. Such beliefs have been linked with the experience of unpleasant side effects following medical treatment, and media coverage may heighten such concerns. Methods The present study sought to assess the influence of news coverage (number of news articles per month) on adverse event reporting in response to Gardasil vaccination in New Zealand over a 7.5-year period, and whether the influence of news coverage was mediated by internet search activity (Google search volumes). Multiple linear regression analyses and simple mediation analyses were used, controlling for year and number of vaccinations delivered. Results News coverage in the previous month, and Google search volumes in the same month, were significant predictors of adverse event reporting, after accounting for vaccination rates and year. Concurrent Google search volumes partially mediated the effect of prior news coverage. Conclusion The results suggest that some of the adverse events reported were not related to the vaccination itself, but to news coverage and internet search volumes, which may have contributed to public concerns about potentially unpleasant or harmful outcomes. These findings have implications for the importance of psychological and social factors in adverse event reporting, and the role of the news media in disseminating health information. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adverse events; Expectations; Gardasil; Human papilloma virus; News media; Nocebo effect",Article,Scopus

Here, a novel nanomaterial with chemiexcited far-red/near-infrared (FR/NIR) emission and singlet oxygen (1O2) generation is reported for precise diagnosis and treatment of tumors. Bis[2,4,5-trichloro-6-(pentyloxycarbonyl)phenyl] oxalate (CPPO) and a specially designed photosensitizer TBD with aggregation-induced FR/NIR emission were co-encapsulated by pluronic F-127 and soybean oil to form C-TBD nanoparticles (C-TBD NPs). These NPs serve as a specific H2O2 probe to precisely track tumors in vivo through chemiluminescence imaging. In addition, effective 1O2 generation by C-TBD NPs in response to tumor H2O2 was observed, which could efficiently induce tumor cell apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth. Both the chemiluminescence response and the therapeutic function were further enhanced when β-phenylethyl isothiocyanate was used to enhance the H2O2 production at the tumor site. Our results prove that C-TBD NPs provide a new strategy for intelligent, accurate, and non-invasive tumor therapy. Precise image-guided therapy is key to eradicating tumors in clinical practice. Here, we report a new nanomaterial based on a chemiexcited photosensitizer, which can be specifically activated by H2O2 within the tumor environment to produce far-red/near-infrared luminescence and singlet oxygen. Using such a nanoparticle, primary and metastatic breast tumors can be clearly identified through chemiluminescence imaging with a very high signal-to-noise ratio. Accompanied by the use of an anti-tumor drug, FEITC, the signal of the tumor could be further enhanced as a result of elevated H2O2 production at the tumor site. More importantly, specific tumor killing can be achieved through chemiexcited singlet oxygen production, and the effect of therapy is also increased in the presence of FEITC. Considering the multiple advantages of simultaneous tumor theranostics, our nanoparticle design represents a promising strategy for future clinical tumor therapy. Organic nanoparticles exhibiting intense FR/NIR chemiluminescence and strong chemiexcited singlet oxygen generation in the presence of H2O2 have been successfully used for selective tumor imaging and therapy. Both tumor chemiluminescent signals and singlet oxygen production can be further enhanced in the presence of an anti-tumor drug, FEITC, which could increase the amount of H2O2 at the tumor site for effective tumor treatment.

However, the mechanism and functional consequences of histone succinylation are unknown. Here we show that the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KGDH) complex is localized in the nucleus in human cell lines and binds to lysine acetyltransferase 2A (KAT2A, also known as GCN5) in the promoter regions of genes. We show that succinyl-coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA) binds to KAT2A. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of KAT2A in complex with succinyl-CoA at 2.3 Å resolution shows that succinyl-CoA binds to a deep cleft of KAT2A with the succinyl moiety pointing towards the end of a flexible loop 3, which adopts different structural conformations in succinyl-CoA-bound and acetyl-CoA-bound forms. Site-directed mutagenesis indicates that tyrosine 645 in this loop has an important role in the selective binding of succinyl-CoA over acetyl-CoA. KAT2A acts as a succinyltransferase and succinylates histone H3 on lysine 79, with a maximum frequency around the transcription start sites of genes. Preventing the α-KGDH complex from entering the nucleus, or expression of KAT2A(Tyr645Ala), reduces gene expression and inhibits tumour cell proliferation and tumour growth. These findings reveal an important mechanism of histone modification and demonstrate that local generation of succinyl-CoA by the nuclear α-KGDH complex coupled with the succinyltransferase activity of KAT2A is instrumental in histone succinylation, tumour cell proliferation, and tumour development. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

However, the aggregation of colorectal and prostate cancer within families has not been well investigated. Methods: Analyses were conducted among participants of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) observational cohort, free of cancer at the baseline examination. Subjects were followed for colorectal cancer through August 31st, 2009. A Cox-proportional hazards regression modeling approach was used to estimate risk of colorectal cancer associated with a family history of prostate cancer, colorectal cancer and both cancers among first-degree relatives of all participants and stratified by race (African American vs. White). Results: Of 75,999 eligible participants, there were 1122 colorectal cancer cases diagnosed over the study period. A family history of prostate cancer alone was not associated with an increase in colorectal cancer risk after adjustment for confounders (aHR =0.94; 95% CI =0.76, 1.15). Separate analysis examining the joint impact, a family history of both colorectal and prostate cancer was associated with an almost 50% increase in colorectal cancer risk (aHR=1.48; 95% CI=1.04, 2.10), but similar to those with a family history of colorectal cancer only (95% CI=1.31; 95% CI=1.11, 1.54). Conclusions: Our findings suggest risk of colorectal cancer is increased similarly among women with colorectal cancer only and among those with both colorectal and prostate cancer diagnosed among first-degree family members.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship of spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) with the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of breast cancer by using tissue-microarray analysis. A consecutive series of 170 patients with breast cancer diagnosed between 2001 and 2004 in hospitals in eastern and southern China were included. Immunohistochemical staining for XBP1s was performed, and the expression of XBP1s was separately examined in nuclei and cytoplasm. We found that a higher expression of XBP1s in nuclei strongly correlated with poorer survival (46.7% versus 75%, P=0.018); however, the expression of XBP1s in the cytoplasm had no relationship with survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the expression of XBP1s was not an independent prognostic factor (RR 2.074, 95% CI 0.909–4.736; P=0.083). None of the other clinicopathological characteristics – age, pathology grade, T stage, N stage, TNM stage, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, or HER2 status – was found to be correlated with XBP1s expression in the nuclei. In conclusion, independently of other clinicopathological factors, the nuclear expression of XBP1s is correlated with shorter breast cancer survival; however, whether nuclear XBP1s is an independent prognostic biomarker needs to be confirmed by further studies with larger samples and detailed sample stratification. © 2017 Wang et al.","Biomarker; Breast cancer; Endoplasmic reticulum stress; Tissue microarray; XBP1s",Article,Scopus

Even though dysregulations of histone deacetylases (HDACs) are known to promote cancer cells survival, the role of different HDACs in the induction of hormone therapy resistance in ER + breast cancer remains unclear. Survivin is a well-known pro-tumor survival molecule and miR-125a-5p is a recently discovered tumor suppressor. In this study, we found that ER + , hormone-independent, tamoxifen-resistant MCF7-TamC3 cells exhibit increased expression of HDAC2, HDAC5, and survivin, but show decreased expression of miR-125a-5p, as compared to the parental tamoxifen-sensitive MCF7 breast cancer cells. Molecular down-regulations of HDAC2, HDAC5, and survivin, and ectopic over-expression of miR-125a-5p, increased the sensitivity of MCF7-TamC3 cells to estrogen deprivation and restored the sensitivity to tamoxifen. The same treatments also further increased the sensitivity to estrogen-deprivation in the ER + hormone-dependent ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells in vitro. Kaplan-Meier analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of expression cohorts of breast tumor showed that high HDAC2 and survivin, and low miR-125a-5p, expression levels correlate with poor relapse-free survival in endocrine therapy and tamoxifen-treated ER + breast cancer patients. Further molecular analysis revealed that HDAC2 and HDAC5 positively modulates the expression of survivin, and negatively regulates the expression miR-125a-5p, in ER + MCF7, MCF7-TamC3, and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells. These findings indicate that dysregulations of HDAC2 and HDAC5 promote the development of hormone independency and tamoxifen resistance in ERC breast cancer cells in part through expression regulation of survivin and miR-125a-5p. © 2017 Huang, Tsai, Chen, Kuo, Kuo, Lee, Chen, Wu, Chuang, Cheng, Lin, Leung, Chang and Cheung.","Breast cancer; HDAC2; HDAC5; Hormone independent; MiR-125a-5p; Survivin",Article,Scopus

Dying tumor cells laden with adjuvant nanodepots efficiently promote activation and antigen cross-presentation by dendritic cells in vitro and elicit robust antigen-specific CD8α + T-cells in vivo. Furthermore, whole tumor-cell vaccination combined with immune checkpoint blockade leads to complete tumor regression in 78% of CT26 tumor-bearing mice and establishes long-term immunity against tumor recurrence.

Mobile health has great potential in many health areas, particularly in health promotion and prevention. There are no randomized controlled trials in Latin America assessing its use in cervical cancer screening. The 'Development of Mobile Technologies for the Prevention of Cervical Cancer in Santiago, Chile' study aims to determine the efficacy of a text-message intervention on Pap test adherence among Chilean women in the metropolitan region of Santiago. Methods/design: This study is a parallel randomized-controlled trial of 400 Chilean women aged 25-64 who are non-adherent with current recommendations for Pap test screening. Participants will be randomly assigned to (1) a control arm (usual care) or (2) an intervention arm, where text and voice messages containing information and encouragement to undergo screening will be sent to the women. The primary endpoint is completion of a Pap test within 6 months of baseline assessment, as determined by medical record review at community-based clinics. Medical record reviewers will be blinded to randomization arms. The secondary endpoint is an evaluation of the implementation and usability of the text message intervention as a strategy to improve screening adherence. Discussion: This intervention using mobile technology intends to raise cervical cancer screening adherence and compliance among a Chilean population of low and middle-low socioeconomic status.

HNPCC is caused by genomic mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes (MMR), namely MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and EPCAM. A non-hereditary, acquired process of hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter can also lead to silencing of MLH1 protein expression. Diagnosis of HNPCC in patients with colorectal and other related cancers is important in the clinical treatment and surveillance of related cancers. The prevalence and clinical characteristics of HNPCC in Asian colorectal cancer patients has been reported in small studies and unique features have been suggested. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics of Asian patients who were diagnosed of colon cancer between 1/2002 and 6/2015, and performed IHC for four MMR protein expressions on tumor specimens as a screening test for HNPCC, followed by confirmatory tests of genomic sequencing and hypermethylation analysis. Results: One hundred forty-three patients were identified. Thirty-one patients were diagnosed younger than 50 years old, while 112 patients were diagnosed older than 50 years old. Six cases of HNPCC were found with a prevalence of 4.19%. The prevalence in the group of patients diagnosed younger than 50 years old is 16.1%, and that in patients diagnosed older than 50 years old is 0.89%. All patients with HNPCC had family histories of colon or gastric cancer. Tumor locations in the HNPCC patients were predominantly in the descending or sigmoid colon (67%). Half of the HNPCC patients had MSH6 mutations. Hypermethylation of the MLH1 gene was only present in 2.80% of the patients. Conclusion: The prevalence of HNPCC is high in patients younger than 50 years old and extremely low in those older than 50 years old. These results may be useful in the future development of guidelines for HNPCC laboratory screening among Asian patients. The pathological and clinical features of HNPCC in this group of Asian immigrant patients are more similar to those reported on Asian patients in their home countries than to Caucasian patients in Western countries, and will warrant further large-scale evaluation. © 2017 The Author(s).","Asian; Colorectal cancer; Hnpcc; Lynch syndrome; Screening",Article,Scopus

Therefore, a renewed focus on how to increase screening uptake, including addressing structural barriers such as time, travel, and cost is needed. One approach could be the provision of combined cancer screening, where multiple screening tests are provided at the same time and location (essentially a 'One Stop' screening shop). This cohort study explored both cancer screening behavior and the acceptability of a combined screening approach. Methods: Participants of the North Western Adelaide Health Study (NWAHS), South Australia were invited to participate in a questionnaire about cancer screening behaviors and the acceptability of a proposed 'One Stop' cancer screening shop. Data were collected from 10th August 2015 to 18th January 2016, weighted for selection probability, age, and sex and analyzed using descriptive and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: 1,562 people, 52% female (mean age 54.1 years ± 15.2) participated. Reported screening participation was low, the highest being for Pap Smear (34.4%). Common reasons for screening participation were preventing sickness (56.1%, CI 53.2-59.0%), maintaining health (51%, CI 48-53.9%), and free program provision (30.9%, CI 28.2-33.6%). Females were less likely to state that screening is not beneficial [OR 0.37 (CI 0.21-0.66), p < 0.001] and to cite sickness prevention [OR 2.10 (CI 1.46-3.00), p < 0.001] and free program [OR 1.75 (CI 1.22-2.51), p < 0.003] as reasons for screening participation. Of those who did not participate, 34.6% (CI 30.3-39.1%) stated that there was nothing that discouraged them from participation, with 55- to 64-year olds [OR 0.24 (CI 0.07-0.74), p < 0.04] being less likely to cite this reason. 21% (CI 17.2-24.8%) thought they did not need screening, while a smaller proportion stated not having time (6.9%, CI 4.9-9.7%) and the costs associated with screening (5.2%, CI 3.5-7.7%). The majority of participants (85.3%, CI 81.9-88.2%) supported multiple screening being offered at the same time and location. Conclusion: Identified screening behaviors in this study are similar to those reported in the literature. The high support for the concept of combined cancer screening demonstrates that this type of approach is acceptable to potential end users and warrants further investigation. © 2017 Bobridge, Price, Gill and Taylor.","Cancer screening; Combined cancer screening; Combined screening; Screening behaviors; Screening participation",Article,Scopus

Viscum album L. (VA, mistletoe) extracts are applied as add-on cancer therapy especially in German speaking countries and within integrative and anthroposophical concepts with the goal to improve quality of life. The primary objective of this pilot observational cohort study was to determine the rate of adverse events (AE) related to ICM therapy with and without VA in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer in a certified Cancer Center. Methods: ICM or combined ICM/VA therapies were applied in patients with progressive or metastatic cancer. AE rates of both therapy groups were compared. Results: A total of sixteen cancer patients were treated with ICM: nivolumab (75%), ipilimumab (19%) or pembrolizumab (6%). The median age of the study population was 64 years (IQR 57.8; 69.3); 44% were male. Of the sixteen patients receiving ICM, nine patients received additional VA (56%; ICM/VA group) and seven did not (44%; ICM group). No statistically significant differences were seen between groups with respect to AE-rates (67% ICM/VA versus 71% ICM). Adjusted multivariate regression analysis revealed that concomitant application of VA did not alter the AE rate in ICM treated patients. 85% of AEs were expected ICM reactions. No AEs of grade 3 or greater were documented for the total study cohort. Conclusions: This is the first study evaluating the clinical safety profile of ICM in combination with VA in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. The overall AE rate of the study cohort is comparable to AE rates of ICM treatment in the literature. Our data indicate a first impression that concomitant VA application may not alter ICM-induced AE rates. However, the nature of this study does not allow excluding possible immunological interactions between ICM and VA. Further prospective trials in larger study cohorts should focus on the assessment of safety aspects, clinical efficacy and health related quality of life in patients with combined ICM/VA therapy.

The inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis frequently progresses to colon cancer; however, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. S100a9 has been emerged as an important pro-inflammatory mediator in acute and chronic inflammation, and the aberrant expression of S100a9 also contributes to tumorigenic processes such as cell proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and immune evasion. We previously revealed that S100a8 and S100a9 are highly activated and play an important role in the process of colitis-associated carcinogenesis, which suggests an attractive therapeutic target for ulcerative colitis and related colon cancer. Here, we report that administration of a neutralizing anti-S100a9 antibody significantly ameliorated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and accompanied by diminished cellular infiltrate of innate immunity cells (macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells) and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tnfα, Il1β, Ifnγ, Il6, Il17α, Il23α, Il4, and Il12α). The protective effect of anti-S100a9 antibody treatment was also observed in azoxymethane (AOM)/DSS-induced colitis-associated cancer (CAC) mouse model. The inflammatory response, tumor cell proliferation, and immune cells infiltration in the colon tissues were suppressed by anti-S100a9 antibody. Gene expression profiling showed that key pathways known to be involved in CAC development, such as Wnt signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and ECM-receptor interaction pathway, were suppressed after treatment with anti-S100a9 antibody in CAC mice. In view of the protective effect of neutralizing anti-S100a9 antibody against DSS-induced colitis and AOM/DSS-induced CAC in mouse model, this study suggests that anti-S100a9 antibody may provide a novel therapeutic approach to treat ulcerative colitis and may decrease the risk for developing CAC. © 2017 Zhang, Wei, Wang, Qin, Wang, Lu, Zheng, Peng, Ye, Ai, Liu, Wang, Li, Shen and Ma.","Colitis-associated cancer; Colorectal cancer; Inflammation; Inflammatory bowel disease; S100a9; Ulcerative colitis",Article,Scopus

This study aimed to explore novel gene signature to predict outcome benefit of postoperative 5-Fu-based therapy in stage II CRC. Methods: Gene-expression profiles of stage II CRCs from two datasets with 5-Fu-based adjuvant chemotherapy (training dataset, n=212; validation dataset, n=85) were analyzed to identify the indicator. A systemic approach by integrating gene-expression and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was implemented to develop the predictive signature. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards model were used to determine the survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy. Experiments with shRNA knock-down were carried out to confirm the signature identified in this study. Results: In the training dataset, we identified 44 PPI sub-modules, by which we separate patients into two clusters (1 and 2) having different chemotherapeutic benefit. A predictor of 11 PPI sub-modules (11-PPI-Mod) was established to discriminate the two sub-groups, with an overall accuracy of 90.1%. This signature was independently validated in an external validation dataset. Kaplan-Meier curves showed an improved outcome for patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy in Cluster 1 sub-group, but even worse survival for those in Cluster 2 sub-group. Similar results were found in both the training and the validation dataset. Multivariate Cox regression revealed an interaction effect between 11-PPI-Mod signature and adjuvant therapy treatment in the training dataset (RFS, p=0.007; OS, p=0.006) and the validation dataset (RFS, p=0.002). From the signature, we found that PTGES gene was up-regulated in CRC cells which were more resistant to 5-Fu. Knock-down of PTGES indicated a growth inhibition and up-regulation of apoptotic markers induced by 5-Fu in CRC cells. Conclusions: Only a small proportion of stage II CRC patients could benefit from adjuvant therapy. The 11-PPI-Mod as a potential predictor could be helpful to distinguish this sub-group with favorable outcome. © 2017 The Author(s).","11-PPI-Mod; Adjuvant chemotherapy; Biomarkers; Colorectal cancer",Article,Scopus

However, current techniques for this procedure represent several inadequacies such as inaccurate resection of tumors and high recurrence rates due to the lack of dexterity and limited instrumentation. In this paper we proposed a concept to improve the efficiency of this procedure. Starting from the anatomic challenges, the design and fabrication procedure of a double arm surgical manipulator made of nitinol was presented. A new actuation concept was introduced which enables a surgeon to facilitate ten degrees of freedom simultaneously. Finally, in-vitro experiments regarding workspace and functionality were conducted to evaluate the developed system. The workspace experiments showed that the entire surface of the bladder can be reached by the manipulator. We also demonstrated that with the developed system, basic tasks such as pick-and-place and circular path marking can be performed. © 2017 IEEE.",,Conference Paper,Scopus

Some studied have claimed an association between infection with this virus and development of breast cancer. The aim of this prospective research was to study the difference in Cytomegalo virus sero-positivity among patients with breast cancer and benign breast diseases, and thereby to prove any association. Materials and Methods: This was a hospital based Case-Control study conducted at the General Surgery wards of our hospital, a tertiary level public sector health care institution. This study was done on 130 patients with breast swellings who underwent surgical excision of their lumps over a 1-year period. Patients with histologically proven malignancies were selected as cases while proven benign cases were deemed to be the controls. IgG and IgM antibodies to Cytomegalo virus were checked in the patients from both groups. Results: All of the studied patients turned out to be positive for Immunoglobulin G against Cytomegalo virus while all the patients were found to be negative for Immunoglobulin M. There was no difference in the antibody titers among the benign and malignant cases in the study. Logistic regression calculation was also carried out including the study parameters and other known risk factors. Conclusions: We conclude that there is no association between Cytomegalo virus sero-positivity and breast cancer. Another conclusion is that the studied adult population has been exposed to Cytomegalo virus in some point of their lives. Further studies of a larger magnitude are essential to confirm our results.

However, the development of drug resistance is almost unavoidable, thus leading to an unsustainable regimen. EGFR T790M mutation is the major cause responsible for the molecular-targeting therapy failure in NSCLC. Although the recently approved osimertinib is effective for the EGFR T790M -positive NSCLC, the osimertinib-resistant EGFR mutation is rapidly developed, too. In this study, we proposed a tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) reprogramming strategy for overcoming the EGFR T790M -associated drug resistance via a dual-targeting codelivery system of gefitinib/vorinostat that acted on both TAM with overexpression of mannose receptors and the HER-2 positive NSCLC cells. The trastuzumab-modified, mannosylated liposomal system was able to repolarize the protumor M2 phenotype to the antitumor M1 and cause the elevating ROS in the cancer cells, consequently modulating the intracellular redox balance via ROS/NOX3/MsrA axis. The suppressed MsrA facilitated the EGFR T790M degradation through 790M oxidation by ROS, thus resensitizing the EGFR T790M -positive cells to gefitinib. The dual-targeting codelivery and TAM-reprogramming strategies provided a potential method for rescuing the EGFR T790M -caused resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","drug resistance; EGFR T790M; gefitinib; nonsmall cell lung cancer; Tumor-associated macrophages; vorinostat",Article,Scopus

Targeting EGFR with the inhibitory antibody cetuximab may affect the motile and invasive behavior of tumor cells. Here, we evaluated the effects of EGFR signaling in gastric cancer cell lines to link the phenotypic behavior of the cells with their molecular characteristics. Methods: Phenotypic effects were analyzed in four gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, Hs746T, LMSU and MKN1) by time-lapse microscopy and transwell invasion assay. Effects on EGFR signaling were detected using Western blot and proteome profiler analyses. A network was constructed linking EGFR signaling to the regulation of cellular motility. Results: The analysis of the effects of treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and cetuximab revealed that only one cell line (MKN1) was sensitive to cetuximab treatment in all phenotypic assays, whereas the other cell lines were either not responsive (Hs746T, LMSU) or sensitive only in certain tests (AGS). Cetuximab inhibited EGFR, MAPK and AKT activity and associated components of the EGFR signaling pathway to different degrees in cetuximab-sensitive MKN1 cells. In contrast, no such changes were observed in Hs746T cells. Thus, the different phenotypic behaviors of the cells were linked to their molecular response to treatment. Genetic alterations had different associations with response to treatment: while PIK3CA mutations and KRAS mutation or amplification were not obstructive, the MET mutation was associated with non-response. Conclusion: These results identify components of the EGFR signaling network as important regulators of the phenotypic and molecular response to cetuximab treatment. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cetuximab; EGFR; Gastric cancer; Invasion; Motility",Article,Scopus

Studies of the prognostic role of NKX2-1 in NSCLC have reported contradictory findings. Two microRNAs (miRNAs) have been associated with NKX2-1: miR-365, which targets NKX2-1; and miR-33a, which is downstream of NKX2-1. We have examined the effect of NKX2-1, miR-365 and miR-33a on survival in a cohort of early-stage NSCLC patients and in sub-groups of patients classified according to the mutational status of TP53, KRAS, and EGFR. Methods: mRNA and miRNA expression was determined using TaqMan assays in 110 early-stage NSCLC patients. TP53, KRAS, and EGFR mutations were assessed by Sanger sequencing. Results: NKX2-1 expression was upregulated in never-smokers (P=0.017), ADK (P<0.0001) and patients with wild-type TP53 (P=0.001). A negative correlation between NKX2-1 and miR-365 expression was found (ρ=-0.287; P=0.003) but there was no correlation between NKX2-1 and miR-33a expression. Overall survival (OS) was longer in patients with high expression of NKX2-1 than in those with low expression (80.8 vs 61.2 months (P=0.035), while a trend towards longer OS was observed in patients with low miR-365 levels (P=0.07). The impact of NKX2-1 on OS and DFS was higher in patients with neither TP53 nor KRAS mutations. Higher expression of NKX2-1 was related to higher OS (77.6 vs 54 months; P=0.017) and DFS (74.6 vs 57.7 months; P=0.006) compared to low expression. The association between NKX2-1 and OS and DFS was strengthened when the analysis was limited to patients with stage I disease (P=0.005 and P=0.003 respectively).

In this study, we aim to present the early outcomes and insights after an interim analysis of a pioneering clinical trial in Brazil. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional analysis of early data from our ongoing clinical trial – an open-label, double-center, single-arm trial on the safety and efficacy of using HIPEC for advanced ovarian cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02249013). A fast-track recovery strategy was also applied to improve patient outcomes. Results: Nine patients with stage IIIB (n=1) or IIIC (n=8) epithelial malignancies were enrolled until February 2017. The median (range) serum CA125 level at diagnosis was 692 (223.7–6550) U/mL. The median number of preoperative cycles of intravenous (i.v.) chemotherapy was 3 (2–4), resulting in peritoneal cancer index scores of 9 (3–18) at the time of HIPEC. Time of restarting i.v. chemotherapy was 37 (33–50) days with all patients completing 6 cycles as planned. The median operation time was 395 (235–760) minutes, the length of hospital stay was 4 (3–10) days, and all the patients left the ICU on the morning after the procedure. Two patients experienced no postoperative complications, whereas 91% of the complications were minor G1/G2 events. Preliminary assessment also suggested no impairment of the patient’s quality of life.

However, due to the large number of images and the complexity of the image processing algorithms, image processing technique is still required a high screening quality. To overcome this problem, some computer aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithms are proposed. In this paper, we have designed and developed a framework combining machine learning based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) and temporal subtraction techniques based on non-rigid image registration algorithm.

Although enzyme catalysis to induce formation of oligopeptide hydrogels has the merits of unique regio- and enantioselectivity and mild reaction conditions, it may cause the impairment of function and activity of the encapsulated proteins by proteolytic degradation during gelation. Here we report a novel enzyme-catalysis strategy for self-assembly of oligopeptide hydrogels using an engineered protease nanocapsule with tunable substrate selectivity. The protease-encapsulated nanocapsule shielded the degradation activity of protease on the laden proteins due to the steric hindrance by the polymeric shell weaved around the protease, whereas the small-molecular precursors were easier to penetrate across the polymeric network and access the catalytic pocket of the protease to convert to the gelators for self-assembling hydrogel. The resulting oligopeptide hydrogels supported a favorable loading capacity without inactivation of both an antiangiogenic protein, hirudin and an apoptosis-inducing cytokine, TRAIL as model proteins. The hirudin and TRAIL coloaded oligopeptide hydrogel for combination cancer treatment showed enhanced synergistic antitumor effects both in vitro and in vivo. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","combination cancer therapy; enzyme catalysis; oligopeptide hydrogel; Protein delivery; self-assembly",Article,Scopus

Methods: GC cell lines SNU-1, HGC27, MGC803 and NCI-N87 were used to evaluate cell viability and apoptosis after gimatecan or irinotecan treatment, using a cell proliferation assay and flow cytometry, respectively. DNA TopI expression and critical molecules of PI3K/AKT, MAPK and apoptosis signaling pathways were analyzed with western blot. For in vivo studies, five PDXs models were treated with gimatecan or irinotecan to assess its antitumor activity. Immunohistochemistry staining of Ki-67 was performed after mice were sacrificed. Results: Gimatecan inhibited the proliferation of GC cells in vitro in a dose- and time-dependent manner by inducing apoptosis, and gimatecan had greater inhibitory effects than irinotecan. In addition, both gimatecan and irinotecan demonstrated significant tumor growth inhibition in in vivo PDX models. Gimatecan treatment significantly inhibited the expression of DNA TopI, phosphorylated AKT (pAKT), phosphorylated MEK (pMEK) and phosphorylated ERK (pERK). Meanwhile, gimatecan could also activate the JNK2 and p38 MAPK pathway as indicated by upregulation of phosphorylated p38 MAPK (p-p38) and phosphorylated JNK2 (pJNK2).

Nuts may also be a major source of aflatoxin B1, a potent liver carcinogen and the risk/benefit balance is unknown. Based on national statistics and data from the PREDIMED intervention trial, we estimated the potential CVD-reduction if Swedes aged 55-79 consumed 30 g nuts/day, instead of the current national average of five grams per day. We also assessed the reduction in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. We estimated the aflatoxin B1 exposure from nuts and calculated the margin of exposure. The approximation that one nanogram aflatoxin B1/kg body weight/day results in one additional liver cancer case/10 million person-years was used to estimate the number of liver cancer cases. The increased nut consumption scenario prevented more than 7000 CVDs in 2013 (306/100,000 person-years) and contributed to about 55,000 saved DALYs for stroke and 22,000 for MI. The concomitant increase in aflatoxin B1 exposure caused an estimated zero to three additional cases of liver cancer, corresponding to 159 DALYs spent, emphasizing the associated risks. Increased nut consumption, as part of a varied healthy diet, is warranted even when aflatoxin B1 exposure is taken into account. However, efforts to reduce aflatoxin exposure from food are essential. © 2017 by the authors.

Methods: Using realist evaluation with a mixed methods case study approach, we conducted documentary analysis of meeting minutes and pathway iterations to map pathway development. We interviewed 14 participants to identify the contexts, mechanisms and outcomes (CMOs) that led to successful pathway development and implementation. Interviews were analysed thematically and four CMO configurations were developed. Results: One site produced three fully implemented pathways, while the other produced two that were partly implemented. In explaining the differences, we found that a respected, independent, well-connected leader modelling partnership working and who facilitates a local, stable group that agree about the legitimacy of the data and project (context) can empower local teams to become sufficiently autonomous (mechanism) to develop and implement research-based pathways (outcome). Although both teams designed relevant, research-based cancer pathways, in the site where the pathways were successfully implemented the research team merely assisted, while, in the other, the research team drove the initiative. Conclusion: Based on our study findings, local stakeholders can apply local and research knowledge to develop and implement research-based pathways. However, success will depend on how academics empower local teams to create autonomy. Crucially, after re-packaging and translating research for local circumstances, identifying fertile environments with the right elements for implementation and developing collaborative relationships with local leaders, academics must step back. © 2017 The Author(s).","Diagnostic pathways for cancer; Knowledge translation; Qualitative research; Realist evaluation",Article,Scopus

Compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy, afatinib has been shown to have better efficacy in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR mutations. However, 40 mg daily as the initial dose is often accompanied by serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and 28 to 53.3% of patients required a dose reduction. No previous study has compared the clinical efficacy and ADRs of different initial doses (40 mg vs. 30 mg daily) of afatinib in lung cancer treatment. Methods: Patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma diagnosed and treated in two Kaohsiung Medical University-affiliated hospitals in Taiwan between May 2014 and August 2016 were identified and followed until December 2016. Demographic characteristics, responses, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and ADRs were recorded. Result: A total of 48 patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma harboring susceptible EGFR mutations who received afatinib as their first-line therapy were enrolled. Patients using 30 mg daily as the initial dose tended to be older and female and have a smaller body size. The patients using 30 mg of afatinib daily as their initial dose had a similar response rate to those receiving 40 mg daily (76% vs. 95%, p = 0.0862) and the same disease control rate (100% vs. 100%, p = 0.1486).

We aimed to identify miRNAs whose differential expression might enable early diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma in patients presenting with ground-glass nodules (GGNs). Methods: To identify potential miRNAs of interest, we analyzed the miRNA expression profile of tumor and adjacent non-para-tumor tissue in three participants by next-generation sequencing (NGS). We then assessed the expression levels of the miRNAs of interest in 73 lung adenocarcinomas presenting with GGNs with matched adjacent non-tumor tissue by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We also detected the miRNA panel in 66 lung benign diseases and 66 lung adenocarcinomas presenting with GGN lesion tissues by qRT-PCR. Target genes of our selected miRNA panel were predicted using Miranda with default parameters. Results: Twenty-three miRNAs showed differential expression between tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissue by NGS. Five miRNAs exhibited higher expression in tumor tissue compared to adjacent non-tumor tissue (P<0.05); 18 miRNAs demonstrated lower expression in tumor tissue versus adjacent non-tumor tissue (P<0.05).

In this paper, we use C5.0 to find the important attributes and apply one classification and two clustering algorithms to observe the consistency of important attributes. In this work, we explore the usefulness of the attributes by finding the accuracy in dataset of breast cancer. We have recorded accuracies of k-means, EMcluster, Naïve Bayes using only the important attributes (which were seven) as 85.23%, 93.14% and 94.72% respectively which was very close to accuracies recorded using all 32 attributes. Naïve Bayes shows better results by using important attributes when compared with all the attributes. © 2017 IEEE.","C5.0; classification algorithms; clustering methods; Data mining; important attributes",Conference Paper,Scopus

To detect the lung cancer, multi detector-row computed tomography (MDCT) images are used in visual screening. Lung cancer can be easily detected by using the chest MDCT images, however, it has enormous images and burden to radiologists. Research and development of the computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system have been assisted the diagnosis. As one of the CAD technologies, temporal subtraction technique is possible to emphasize the changing interval on the CT images. It uses subtraction operation between previous and current CT images of the same patient. On the other hand, pattern recognition using image reconstruction by sparse coding method has attracted attention. This technique is mathematically modeling the information processing by the primary visual cortex of human. It is the technique for representing images by the linear combination of a small number of basis. In this paper, candidate nodules under 20[mm] were segmented from temporal subtraction images based on the 3D sparse coding technique.3D sparse coding is three dimensional expansion of the sparse coding. Also, we classified the final candidate nodules using support vector machine (SVM) method based on coefficient matrix which are obtained by the 3D sparse coding. We applied proposed method to 31 cases of chest MDCT images in which the number of nodules was more than one.

The present study investigated the anti-cancer activity of simvastatin and its underlying regulatory mechanism in cultured ATC cells. Simvastatin (0-20 µM) concentration-dependently reduced cell viability and relative colony formation. Depletions of mevalonate (MEV) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp) by simvastatin induced G1 arrest and increased apoptotic cell populations at the sub-G1 phase. Adding MEV and GGpp prevented the simvastatin-inhibited cell proliferation. Immunoblotting analysis illustrated that simvastatin diminished the activation of RhoA and Rac1 protein, and this effect was prevented by pre-treatment with MEV and GGpp. Simvastatin increased the levels of p21cip and p27kip proteins and reduced the levels of hyperphosphorylated-Rb, E2F1 and CCND1 proteins. Adding GGpp abolished the simvastatin-increased levels of p27kip protein, and the GGpp-caused effect was abolished by Skp2 inhibition. Introduction of Cyr61 siRNA into ATC cells prevented the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-enhanced cell migration. The EGF-induced increases of Cyr61 protein expression and cell migration were prevented by simvastatin. Taken together, these results suggest that simvastatin induced ATC proliferation inhibition through the deactivation of RhoA/Rac1 protein and overexpression of p21cip and p27kip, and migration inhibition through the abrogation of Cyr61 protein expression. © 2017 by the authors.

Looking into the reported chemo-preventive effect we speculated antitumor activity in retinoblastoma (RB) Y79 cells, we also studied the molecular mechanism for antitumor activity. Methods: The effect of QCT on Y79 cell viability count was done by cell counting kit, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis studies and mitochondrial membrane potential was evaluated by flow cytometry. Protein expression was done by western blot analysis. Results: The outcomes of study showed that QCT reduced Y79 cell viability and caused arrest of G1 phase in cell cycle via decreasing the expression levels of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2/6 and cyclin D3 and by increasing the levels of both CDK inhibitor proteins p21 and p27. Apoptosis of Y79 cells mediated by QCT occurred via activation of both caspases-3/-9. Flow cytometry studies showed that QCT caused collapse in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δ Ψm) in Y79 cells. Western blot studies confirmed that QCT brought about phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). We also established that inhibitors of JNK and p38 MAPK suppressed QCT mediated activation of both caspases-3/-9 and subdued the apoptosis of cancerous Y79 cells. Conclusion: All the results of the study suggest that QCT induced the apoptosis of Y79 cells via activation of JNK and p38 MAPK pathways, providing a novel treatment approach for human RB. © 2017 The Author(s).","Apoptosis; C-Jun N-terminal kinase; P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase; Quercetin; Retinoblastoma",Article,Scopus

Methods: Linc-ROR and SOX9 expression were examined in ESCC specimens, cell lines, and cultured tumorspheres. We investigated the effects of linc-ROR on SOX9 expression and malignant phenotypes by CCK8, colony formation, Transwell, and sphere-forming assay. The linc-ROR/SOX9 interaction mediated by multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) was confirmed by bioinformatic analysis, luciferase assay, and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation, transient overexpression or antagonizing endogenous candidate miRNAs. The effect of linc-ROR depletion on tumor growth was assessed by xenograft assay. Results: A positive correlation between linc-ROR and SOX9 expression was found in clinical ESCC specimens (r = 0.562, P = 0.036), cell lines, and tumorspheres. Silencing of linc-ROR significantly inhibited cell proliferation, motility, chemoresistance, and self-renewal capacity. Mechanistically, linc-ROR modulating the derepression of SOX9 by directly sponging multiple miRNAs including miR-15b, miR-33a, miR-129, miR-145, and miR-206. Antagonizing these miRNAs counteracted with linc-ROR silencing, whereas the repression of SOX9 abrogated malignant phenotypes induced by the cocktail of miRNA inhibitors. Moreover, linc-ROR disruption was sufficient to attenuate tumor growth and cancer stem cell marker expression in vivo.

Though advances toward elucidating (pre)colibactin biosynthesis have been made, the functions and mechanisms of several clb gene products remain poorly understood. Here we report the 2.1 Å X-ray structure and molecular function of ClbS, a gene product that confers resistance to colibactin toxicity in host bacteria and which has been shown to be important for bacterial viability. The structure harbors a potential colibactin binding site and shares similarity to known hydrolases. In vitro studies using a synthetic colibactin analog and ClbS or an active site residue mutant reveal cyclopropane hydrolase activity that converts the electrophilic cyclopropane of the colibactins into an innocuous hydrolysis product. As the cyclopropane has been shown to be essential for genotoxic effects in vitro, this ClbS-catalyzed ring-opening provides a means for the bacteria to circumvent self-induced genotoxicity.

Tailored stimuli-responsive systems may be paired with diagnostic radionuclides to improve surgical guidance and aid in detecting therapeutic radionuclides otherwise difficult to image with conventional nuclear medicine approaches. Because light emanating from these interactions is typically low in intensity and blue-weighted (i.e., greatly scattered and absorbed in vivo), it is imperative to increase or shift the photon flux for improved detection. To address this challenge, a gel that is both scintillating and fluorescent is used to enhance the optical photon output in image mapping for cancer imaging. Tailoring biobased materials to synthesize thixotropic thermoreversible hydrogels (a minimum gelation concentration of 0.12 wt %) offers image-aiding systems which are not only functional but also potentially economical, safe, and environmentally friendly. These robust gels (0.66 wt %, 900 Pa) respond predictably to different types of IRs including β- and emitters, resulting in a doubling of the detectable photon flux from these emitters. The synthesis and formulation of such a gel are explored with a focus on its physicochemical and mechanical properties, before being utilized to enhance the visible photon flux from a panel of radionuclides as detected. The possibility of developing a topical cream of this gel makes this system an attractive potential alternative to current techniques, and the multifunctionality of the gelator may serve to inspire future next-generation materials. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","biobased; cancer imaging; Cerenkov imaging; esculin; molecular gels; scintillation; self-assembly",Article,Scopus

Needle biopsy was performed, and the histological findings revealed adenocarcinoma positive for thyroid transcription factor-1. No evidence of a primary tumor, including the lung and thyroid gland, could be found elsewhere despite detailed examinations, including thyroid echography, chest computed tomography, and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. The soft tissue tumor was resected with a wide margin. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the tumor cells to be positive for cytokeratin-AE1/3, cytokeratin 7, synaptophysin, chromogranin A, calcitonin, and carcinoembryonic antigen, but negative for cytokeratin 20, Napsin A, Pax8, and p40, resulting in a diagnosis of metastasis of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Conclusion: Initial presentation with a single metastasis to soft tissue and undetectable primary tumor in the thyroid gland is an extremely rare clinical manifestation in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma. © 2017 The Author(s).","Calcitonin; CEA; Primary unknown origin; Soft tissue metastasis; TTF-1",Article,Scopus

This study is aimed to investigate the expression of ribonucleotide reductase (RR) subunit p53R2 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and its significance in the prognosis. Methods: The expression levels of p53R2 in 201 patients with NPC were examined by immunohistochemical assay. The correlations of p53R2 expression and clinicopathological features of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patient were analysed by chi-square test. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox multivariate regression model were used to analyze the prognostic significance of the patients with NPC. Results: Immunohistochemical results showed that p53R2 was positively expressed in 92.5% (186/201) of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and the high expression rate was 38.3% (77/201). Further analysis observed that the negative correlation between expression of p53R2 and pT status had statistical significance (P<0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis found that the mean survival time of patients with high expression of p53R2 was 143.32 months, while the patients with low expression level of p53R2 was 121.63 months (P<0.05). Cox regression analysis suggested that p53R2 protein expression could be used as an independent prognostic factor for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (P<0.05). Conclusions: This study drew a conclusion that p53R2 could be used as a prognostic biomarker indicative of the favorable outcome for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. © 2017 The Author(s).","Immunohistochemistry; Nasopharyngeal carcinoma; P53R2; Prognosis",Article,Scopus

Far away from ultraviolet sun exposure, the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis and the highly aggressive clinical behavior are poorly understood. In many solid malignomas of the head and neck region, p53 tumor suppressor functions as oncogene due to p53 protein stabilizing mutation. Interestingly, the vast majority of MM demonstrates constitutively expressed p53 protein, with protein stabilizing mutations being rare.

The indeno[1,2-b]indole scaffold is a novel lead structure to develop ATP-competitive CK2 inhibitors. Some indeno[1,2-b]indole-based CK2 inhibitors additionally obstruct ABCG2, an ABC half transporter overexpressed in breast cancer and co-responsible for drug efflux and resistance. Comprehensive derivatization studies revealed substitutions of the indeno[1,2-b]indole framework that boost either the CK2 or the ABCG2 selectivity or even support the dual inhibition potential.

However, the related mechanisms are largely elusive. Recently, increasing evidences indicate that adipocytes might be involved in the proliferation, homing, migration and invasion of several malignancies. In the present study, we attempt to determine the effects and possible mechanisms of adipocytes on regulating progression of CCA. Methods: Adipocyte-CCA cell co-culture system and CCA metastasis mice model were used to determine the effects of adipocytes on CCA metastasis. We identified the biological functions and possible mechanisms of adipocyte-derived fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) in regulating the adipocyte-induced CCA metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes, both in vitro and in vivo. Results: Adipocyte-CCA cell co-culture promotes the in vitro and in vivo tumor metastasis, leading to increased adipocyte-derived fatty acid absorbance and intracellular lipids of CCA cells, which indicates adipocytes might function as the energy source for CCA progression by providing free fatty acids. Further, highly expressed FABP4 protein was identified in adipose tissues and fully differentiated adipocytes, and upregulated FABP4 was also detected by qRT-PCR assay in CCA cells co-cultivated with adipose extracts as compared to parental CCA cells. The specific FABP4 inhibitor BMS309403 significantly impaired adipocyte-induced CCA metastasis and EMT phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions: Together, the results demonstrate that the adipocyte-CCA interaction and the energy extraction of CCA cells from adipocytes are crucial for the invasion, migration and EMT of CCA cells. FABP4 from adipocytes mediates these adipocyte-induced variations in CCA cells, which could serve as a potential target for the treatment of CCA. © 2017 The Author(s).","Adipocytes; Cholangiocarcinoma; Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4); Metastasis",Article,Scopus

As members of the Ca2+ permeable transient receptor potential (TRP), five of the channels (TRPV1-4 and TRPM2) are activated by different heat temperatures, and two of the channels (TRPA1 and TRPM8) are activated by cold temperature. Accumulating evidences indicates that antagonists of TRPA1 and TRPM8 may protect against cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and paclitaxel-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress, inflammation, cold allodynia, and hyperalgesia. TRPV1 was responsible from the cisplatin-induced heat hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in the sensory neurons.

High antitumor efficacy and low toxicity require that PTX mainly accumulated in tumors with little drug exposure to normal tissues. However, many PTX-loaded micelle formulations suffer from low stability, fast drug release, and lack of tumor-targeting capability in the circulation. To overcome these challenges, we developed a micellar formulation that consists of sodium cholate (NaC) and monomethoxy poly (ethylene glycol)-block-poly (D, L-lactide) (mPEG-PDLLA). Methods: PTX-loaded NaC-mPEG-PDLLA micelles (PTX-CMs) and PTX-loaded mPEG-PDLLA micelles (PTX-Ms) were formulated, and their characteristics, particle size, surface morphology, release behavior in vitro, pharmacokinetics and in vivo biodistributions were researched. In vitro and in vivo tumor inhibition effects were systematically investigated. Furthermore, the hemolysis and acute toxicity of PTX-CMs were also evaluated. Results: The size of PTX-CMs was 53.61±0.75 nm and the ζ-potential was -19.73±0.68 mV. PTX was released much slower from PTX-CMs than PTX-Ms in vitro. Compared with PTX-Ms, the cellular uptake of PTX-CMs was significantly reduced in macrophages and significantly increased in human cancer cells, and therefore, PTX-CMs showed strong growth inhibitory effects on human cancer cells. In vivo, the plasma AUC0-t of PTX-CMs was 1.8-fold higher than that of PTX-Ms, and 5.2-fold higher than that of Taxol. The biodistribution study indicated that more PTX-CMs were accumulated in tumor than PTX-Ms and Taxol. Furthermore, the significant antitumor efficacy of PTX-CMs was observed in mice bearing BEL-7402 hepatocellular carcinoma and A549 lung carcinoma. Results from drug safety assessment studies including acute toxicity and hemolysis test revealed that the PTX-CMs were safe for in vivo applications. Conclusion: These results strongly revealed that NaC-mPEG-PDLLA micelles can tumor-target delivery of PTX and enhance drug penetration in tumor, suggesting that NaC-mPEG-PDLLA micelles are promising nanocarrier systems for anticancer drugs delivery. © 2017 Zhang et al.","Enhanced; Polymeric micelles; Sodium cholate; Tumor-targeting delivery",Article,Scopus

An intensive noise inherent to modern technologies of CNAs probing often causes inconsistency between the estimates provided by different methods. Therefore, testing estimates by the confidence masks is recommended to guarantee an existence of genomic changes within certain regions. In known masks, jitter in the CNA's breakpoints is expected to be distributed with the skew Laplace law, which is sufficiently accurate when the segmental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) exceeds unity. In this paper, we extend the confidence masks to low and very low SNRs often observed in subtle chromosomal changes. The modified masks employ several proposed approximations of the segmental noise variance as a function of the departure step from the candidate breakpoint. Because approximations are accurate in jitter computation only for specified SNR regions, we suggest using hybrid masks to achieve the maximum available accuracy. Confidence masks are tested experimentally by genome CNA profile data obtained using the single nucleotide polymorphism array. © 2013 IEEE.","breakpoints; confidence masks; copy number alterations; Genome; jitter distribution",Article,Scopus

This paper presents an investigation of use of redundancy resolution to solve the problem of visual occlusion. Specifically, the paper addresses hard cases where a continuum robot or an ablation catheter emanate from a narrow access channel containing an endoscope. A redundancy resolution method accounting for the kinematics of the continuum robot and allowing for rotation of an angled lens endoscope is presented. A potential field method is used to guide all portions of the continuum arm outside of the visualization cone of the endoscope and a gradient descent method is used to guide the rotation of the endoscope to keep the end-effector as close as possible to the center of the visual field of the endoscope.

While accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) and hyper-phosphorylation of tau are parts of the etiology, AD can be caused by a large number of different genetic mutations and other unknown factors. Considering such a heterogeneous nature of AD, it would be desirable to develop treatment strategies that can improve memory irrespective of the individual causes. Reducing the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) was shown to enhance long-Term memory and synaptic plasticity in naïve mice. Moreover, hyper-phosphorylation of eIF2α is observed in the brains of postmortem AD patients. Therefore, regulating eIF2α phosphorylation can be a plausible candidate for restoring memory in AD by targeting memory-enhancing mechanism. In this study, we examined whether PKR inhibition can rescue synaptic and learning deficits in two different AD mouse models; 5XFAD transgenic and Aβ 1-42 -injected mice. We found that the acute treatment of PKR inhibitor (PKRi) can restore the deficits in long-Term memory and long-Term potentiation (LTP) in both mouse models without affecting the Aβ load in the hippocampus.

In this context, cellular membrane protrusions and the actin cytoskeleton are essential to guide DC migration towards chemotactic signals. Caveolin-1 (CAV1) is a scaffolding protein that modulates signaling pathways leading to remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and enhanced migration of cancer cells. However, whether CAV1 is relevant for DC function and specifically for DC migration to LNs is unknown. Here, we show that CAV1 expression is upregulated in DCs upon LPS- and TNF-a-induced maturation. CAV1 deficiency did not affect differentiation, maturation, or the ability of DCs to activate CD8+ T cells in vitro. However, CAV1-deficient (CAV1-/-) DCs displayed reduced in vivo trafficking to draining LNs in control and inflammatory conditions. In vitro, CAV1-/- DCs showed reduced directional migration in CCL21 gradients in transwell assays without affecting migration velocity in confined microchannels or three-dimensional collagen matrices. In addition, CAV1-/- DCs displayed reduced activation of the small GTPase Rac1, a regulator of actin cytoskeletal remodeling, and lower numbers of F-actin-forming protrusions. Furthermore, mice adoptively transferred with peptide-pulsed CAV1-/- DCs showed reduced CD8+ T cell responses and antitumor protection. Our results suggest that CAV1 promotes the activation of Rac1 and the formation of membrane protrusions that favor DC chemotactic trafficking toward LNs where they can initiate cytotoxic T cell responses. © 2017 Oyarce, Cruz-Gomez, Galvez-Cancino, Vargas, Moreau, Diaz-Valdivia, Diaz, Salazar-Onfray, Pacheco, Lennon-Dumenil, Quest and Lladser.","Antitumor immune response; Caveolin-1; CD8+ T cell activation; Chemotaxis; Dendritic cells; Migration",Article,Scopus

The major allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism rs12033832 in the sweet taste receptor (TAS1R2) has previously been associated with lower sugar sensitivity and higher sugar intake among overweight individuals. The aim of the present study was to examine the association between dietary intake and the TAS1R2 genotype in lean and overweight individuals in the population-based Malmö Diet and Cancer (MDC) cohort using dietary intake data with a high validity. Methods: In total, 3,602 participants (46-68 years old) from the MDC cohort who underwent baseline examinations between 1991 and 1994, who were non-smokers without diabetes, and for whom information regarding TAS1R2 rs7534618 (a proxy for rs12033832) was available were included in this study. After excluding individuals with potentially misreported and unstable food habits, 2,204 individuals were retained. A modified dietary history method, including a 7-day food diary of prepared meals, which was specifically designed for the MDC study was used. Results: Only modest associations were observed between dietary intake and the TAS1R2 genotype. We observed slightly stronger associations after excluding individuals with potentially misreported and unstable food habits. Among the participants with a BMI ≥25, the major (T) allele carriers consumed more carbohydrates [TT = 45.2 percentage of energy intake (E%); TG = 45.2E%; GG = 43.7E%; p = 0.01] and less fat (p = 0.03), but these participants did not consume more sucrose than the G-allele carriers. No association was observed between the genotype and dietary intake among the participants with a BMI < 25. Conclusion: Although the higher carbohydrate intake among the major allele carriers was consistent with that reported in a previous study, the magnitudes of the associations were substantially smaller. Because we observed no association with sucrose, this allele is unlikely to be useful as a marker of sugar intake in the MDC population. © 2017 Habberstad, Drake and Sonestedt.","Cohort; Diet; Epidemiology; Polymorphism; Sweet taste receptor gene; Taste receptor gene",Article,Scopus

However, little is known regarding the roles of FGFs/FGFRs in cortical circuit formation. Here we show that Fgfr1/2/3 and Fgf 7/9/10/22 mRNAs are expressed in the developing primary somatosensory (S1) barrel cortex. Barrel cortex layer IV spiny stellate cells (bSCs) are the primary recipients of ascending sensory information via thalamocortical axons (TCAs). Detail quantification revealed distinctive phases for bSC dendritogenesis: orienting dendrites toward TCAs, adding de novo dendritic segments, and elongating dendritic length, while maintaining dendritic patterns. Deleting Fgfr1/2/3 in bSCs had minimal impact on dendritic polarity but transiently increased the number of dendritic segments. However, 6 d later, FGFR1/2/3 loss of function reduced dendritic branch numbers. These data suggest that FGFs/FGFRs have a role in stabilizing dendritic patterning. Depolarization of cultured mouse cortical neurons upregulated the levels of several Fgf/Fgfr mRNAs within 2 h. In vivo, within6 hof systemic kainic acid administration at postnatal day 6, mRNA levels of Fgf9, Fgf10, Fgfr2c, and Fgfr3b in S1 cortices were enhanced, and this was accompanied by exuberant dendritogenesis of bSCs by 24 h. Deleting Fgfr1/2/3 abolished kainic acid-induced bSC dendritic overgrowth. Finally, FGF9/10 gain of function also resulted in extensive dendritogenesis. Together, our data suggest that FGFs/FGFRs can be regulated by glutamate transmission to modulate/stabilize bSC dendritic complexity.

In injured nerves, this transcription factor promotes the repair Schwann cell phenotype and regeneration and promotes Schwann-cell-mediated neurotrophic support in models of peripheral neuropathies. However, c-Jun is associated with tumor formation in some systems, potentially suppresses myelin genes, and has been implicated in demyelinating neuropathies. To clarify these issues and to determine how c-Jun levels determine its function, we have generated c-Jun OE/+ and c-Jun OE/OE mice with graded expression of c-Jun in Schwann cells and examined these lines during development, in adulthood, and after injury using RNA sequencing analysis, quantitative electron microscopic morphometry, Western blotting, and functional tests. Schwann cells are remarkably tolerant of elevated c-Jun because the nerves of c-Jun OE/+ mice, in which c-Jun is elevated ∼6-fold, are normal with the exception of modestly reduced myelin thickness. The stronger elevation of c-Jun in c-Jun OE/OE mice is, however, sufficient to induce significant hypomyelination pathology, implicating c-Jun as a potential player in demyelinating neuropathies. The tumor suppressor P19ARF is strongly activated in the nerves of these mice and, even in aged c-Jun OE/OE mice, there is no evidence of tumors. This is consistent with the fact that tumors do not form in injured nerves, although they contain proliferating Schwann cells with strikingly elevated c-Jun. Furthermore, in crushed nerves of c-Jun OE/+ mice, where c-Jun levels are overexpressed sufficiently to accelerate axonal regeneration, myelination and function are restored after injury. © 2017 Fazal, Gomez-Sanchez et al.","c-Jun; Myelin; PNS; Regeneration; Schwann; Tumorigenesis",Article,Scopus

We have previously shown that turmeric root (TE) and rosemary leaf (RE) extracts can work synergistically to reduce neoplastic cell growth, but the mechanisms are poorly understood and require further elucidation. Results: Three different canine cell lines (C2 mastocytoma, and CMT-12 mammary carcinoma, D17 osteosarcoma) were treated with 6.3 μg mL -1 extract individually, or 3.1 μg mL -1 of each extract in combination based on studies showing synergy of these two extracts. Apoptosis, antioxidant effects, cellular accumulation of curcumin, and perturbation of signaling pathways were assessed. The TE + RE combination treatment resulted in Caspase 3/7 activation and apoptosis in all cell lines, beyond the effects of TE alone with the CMT-12 cell line being most susceptible. Both extracts had antioxidant effects with RE reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) by 40-50% and TE reducing ROS by 80-90%. In addition RE treatment enhanced the c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity in the C2 cell line and TE + RE exposure increased activated JNK by 4-5 times in the CMT-12 cell line. Upon further examination, it was found that RE treatment caused a significant increase in the cellular accumulation of curcumin by approximately 30% in the C2 and D17 cell lines, and by 4.8-fold in the CMT-12 cell line. This increase in intracellular curcumin levels may play a role in the synergy exhibited when using TE and RE in combination. Conclusions: The use of RE in combination with TE induces a synergistic response to induce apoptosis which is better than either extract alone. This appears to be related to a variable increased TE uptake in cells and activation of pathways involved in the apoptotic response. © 2017 The Author(s).","Apoptosis; Canine cancer; Curcumin; Mammary carcinoma; Mastocytoma; Osteosarcoma; Rosemary",Article,Scopus

The major pathological hallmark of AD is the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ), which is produced from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through cleavage of β- and γ-secretase. Recently, dietary plant oil containing ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid has become an attractive alternative source to fish oil containing eicosapentaenoic acid or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We investigated whether ALA isolated from perilla oil has direct effects on improvement of cognitive ability and molecular mechanisms in APP processing in comparison with DHA. In the present study, ICR mice were treated orally with ALA or DHA (100 mg/kg/day) for 14 days after i.c.v. injection of Aβ 25-35 . Administration of ALA resulted in a prevention of learning and memory deficit in Aβ 25-35 -injected mice compared with the control group, as observed in T-maze, novel object recognition, and Morris water maze tests. ALA supplementation also markedly ameliorated the Aβ 25-35 -induced oxidative stress by inhibition of lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide overproduction in the mouse brain, liver, and kidney, almost down to the levels in DHA-administered group. These effects of ALA on protective mechanisms were related to the regulation of APP processing via promoting nonamyloidogenic pathway such as up-regulation of soluble APP alpha, C-terminal fragment alpha/beta ratio, and A disintegrin and metalloprotease10 protein expressions. Furthermore, ALA inhibited the amyloidogenic pathway through the down-regulation of β-site APP-cleaving enzyme and presenilin2. ALA also enhanced Aβ degradation enzyme, insulin-degrading enzyme. In conclusion, the present study indicated a beneficial effect of ALA in improving the cognitive ability against Aβ 25-35 , and these effects were comparable to those exerted by DHA. Its neuroprotective effects are mediated, in part, by regulation of APP processing and Aβ degradation, and thus, ALA might be a potential candidate for prevention or treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","alpha-linolenic acid; Alzheimer's disease; Aβ 25-35; cognitive ability; Perilla frutescens",Article,Scopus

However, research identifying factors influencing sitting time in adults is limited, especially in Asian populations. This study aimed to identify socio-demographic and lifestyle correlates of occupational, leisure and total sitting time in a sample of Singapore working adults. Methods: Data were collected between 2004 and 2010 from participants of the Singapore Multi Ethnic Cohort (MEC). Medical exclusion criteria for cohort participation were cancer, heart disease, stroke, renal failure and serious mental illness. Participants who were not working over the past 12 months and without data on sitting time were excluded from the analyses. Multivariable regression analyses were used to examine cross-sectional associations of self-reported age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, education, smoking, caloric intake and moderate-to-vigorous leisure time physical activity (LTPA) with self-reported occupational, leisure and total sitting time. Correlates were also studied separately for Chinese, Malays and Indians. Results: The final sample comprised 9384 participants (54.8% male): 50.5% were Chinese, 24.0% Malay, and 25.5% Indian. For the total sample, mean occupational sitting time was 2.71 h/day, mean leisure sitting time was 2.77 h/day and mean total sitting time was 5.48 h/day. Sitting time in all domains was highest among Chinese. Age, gender, education, and caloric intake were associated with higher occupational sitting time, while ethnicity, marital status and smoking were associated with lower occupational sitting time. Marital status, smoking, caloric intake and LTPA were associated with higher leisure sitting time, while age, gender and ethnicity were associated with lower leisure sitting time. Gender, marital status, education, caloric intake and LTPA were associated with higher total sitting time, while ethnicity was associated with lower total sitting time. Stratified analyses revealed different associations within sitting domains for Indians compared to Chinese and Malays. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the need to focus on separate domains of sitting (occupational, leisure or total) when identifying which factors determine this behavior, and that the content of intervention programs should be tailored to domain-specific sitting rather than to sitting in general. Finally, our study showed ethnic differences and therefore we recommend to culturally target interventions. © 2017 The Author(s).","Adults; Asia; Correlates; Multi-ethnic; Prevalence; Sitting",Article,Scopus

Rectal cancer surgery is associated with high rates of post-operative complications in which the most common are Surgical Site Infections (SSI). Materials and methods. Factors responsible for SSI incidence were retrospectively analysed in rectal cancer patients who had undergone surgery at a single centre for oncology between July 2012 and July 2016. The study end-point was patients' contracting SSI. Statistical analyses were performed by the 'Statistica 12' package consisting of the Pearson's Chi-squared test (x2), the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U-test (with continuity correction). Qualitative variables were analysed using log-linear analysis. The likelihoods of SSI incidence were compared by using odds ratios within 95% confidence limits. Results. Amongst the 187 patient subjects under observation during their 30 day follow-up, 44 (23.5%) suffered from post-operative complications of which SSI were the most common at 27 (14.4%). In those patients with advanced stage IV cancer, SSI occurred 3-fold more compared to patients with lower stage cancers; respectively 27.3% vs 11.7%, p = 0.021. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the highest SSI risk was in patients having a low-lying tumour (≤ 5 cm from the anal rim; OR 2.31 (95% CI of 1.15 to 4.62), p = 0.019 and those patients who had undergone Hartmann's procedure; OR 1.85 (95% CI of 1.04 to 3.31), p = 0.038. Conclusions. Surgical site infections in rectal cancer patients undergoing surgery occur significantly more in those at advanced stage IV rectal cancer where the tumour is low-lying (0-5 cm from the anal rim) and after having undergone the Hartmann's procedure. © Polskie Towarzystwo Onkologiczne.","Rectal cancer; Surgical site infections",Article,Scopus

One of the likely factors for poorer treatment outcomes in Poland may be the long times between when cancer is suspected to starting treatment. This study has thus aimed to determine whether the introduced oncology reforms have succeeded in reducing such times. Materials and methods. The study survey was undertaken at 6 oncological centres on patient subjects before (n = 1373) and after (n = 431) the oncological reform (DILO) had been introduced. Data was obtained from an inhouse devised questionnaire together with patient interview and their medical history. The following waiting times were estimated: A) from suspicion of cancer, (date of first doctor visit due to appearance of symptoms, screening//follow-up or prevention), to diagnosis (date of histopathological confirmation), B) from suspicion of cancer to the start of treatment and C) from diagnosis to starting treatment before and after the DILO reform had been introduced. Results. The median waiting time between suspicion of cancer and treatment was 11 weeks before the DILO reform but was not significantly shortened after its introduction; the reduction being barely 3 days. This waiting time was however increased by 8 days in those patients without DILO cards. Before the DILO reform, the median time from diagnosis was 5.9 weeks, but was reduced by 8 days in patients bearing the DILO card and indeed increased in those without the DILO card by over 2 weeks. Conclusions. Cancer treatment waiting times in Poland is still somewhat long (over 9 weeks in most cases). Introducing the oncological reform has not significantly impacted on shortening the waiting times in cancer patients for receiving oncological treatment. © Polskie Towarzystwo Onkologiczne.","Cancer; Diagnosis; DILO reform; Health services; Waiting time",Article,Scopus

Despite a decline in breast cancer mortality, prognosis of advanced breast cancer remains poor. In a desperate need to improve breast cancer outcomes, newer agents that target molecular pathways are being tested. Deregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is frequently found in breast cancer. This can lead to resistance of endocrine therapy and anti-HER2 therapies. Targeting this pathway may restore sensitivity to these compounds. Buparlisib (BKM-120) is an orally active pan-PI3K inhibitor evaluated in different tumor types. Areas covered: Buparlisib is one of the most investigated PI3K inhibitors. Preclinical and clinical studies of buparlisib in breast cancer are analyzed and discussed. This article reviews the status of buparlisib, completed and ongoing trials, and its safety. Expert opinion: PI3K inhibitors show promising results in breast cancer. However, we raise a number of issues including the identification of biomarkers to predict treatment response and strategies to counteract resistance. Moreover, its toxicity profile could limit its extensive use. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Breast cancer; buparlisib; chemotherapy; endocrine therapy; phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase",Article,Scopus

Recently, increasing evidence has demonstrated that miRNAs modulate many important molecular pathways involved in chemotherapy. Previous studies demonstrated that miR-199a affected ovarian cancer cell resistance to cisplatin (DDP). However, the role of miR-199a and its target genes in determination of ovarian cancer sensitivity to DDP remains unclear. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression levels of miR-199a in ovarian cancer tissues and C13* and OV2008 cell lines. After transfection of miR-199a mimic or inhibitor, flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis exposed to DDP. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot assay were applied to detect tumor necrosis factor-α levels and protein expression levels of Bax, Fas, Fas-associated death domain, and caspase-8. The results indicated that the expression of miR-199a was downregulated and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (Hif1α) upregulated in the ovarian tumors compared with those in the corresponding normal tissues. Besides, the expression levels of miR-199a were significantly higher in OV2008 cells compared with those in C13* cells. Moreover, suppression of Hif1α reversed the inhibiting function of miR-199a inhibitor on DDP-induced apoptosis in the OV2008 cells. However, overexpression of both miR-199a and Hif1α reduced DDP-induced apoptosis in C13* cells. In conclusion, miR-199a may change DDP resistance in ovarian cancer by regulating Hif1α. © 2017 Feng et al.","Cisplatin resistance; Hif1α; MiR-199a; Ovarian cancer",Article,Scopus

Malnutrition accompanies many cancers, especially those of the gastrointestinal tract, and significantly raises the risk of postoperative complications in cancer surgery. In Poland, hospitals are legally obliged to evaluate the nutritional status of their patients; one of the assessment tools used for this purpose is the NRS 2002 scale. Aim. The primary objective of the study is to analyze the utility of the NRS 2002 scale in the risk assessment of postoperative complications in gastrointestinal cancers. In addition, the authors propose to determine whether the legal requirement to conduct nutritional assessments among hospitalized patients is complied with in clinical practice and to evaluate the risk of malnutrition in the study group. Materials and methods. A detailed assessment was conducted on 226 patients who underwent surgery for upper (95 patients) and lower (131 patients) GI tract cancers in 2015. The risk of complications was analyzed based on the nutritional risk score (NRS 2002) and the levels of albumin and total proteins in the serum before surgery. Compliance with the obligation to carry out nutritional assessments was evaluated on breast and GI cancer patients treated with surgery at the Institute of Oncology in Warsaw in two successive years. Results. An NRS 2002 score of ≥ 3 was shown to predict postoperative complications for both upper GI tract (p < 0.001) and colorectal cancers (p < 0.001). In upper GI cancers, complications were also more frequently observed at lower albumin (p = 0.018) and total protein (p = 0.025) levels in the serum. Conclusion. The analysis shows that the NRS 2002 scale is useful in predicting the risk of postoperative complications in the treatment of upper and lower GI tract cancers. © Polskie Towarzystwo Onkologiczne.","Gastrointestinal cancers; Malnutrition; NRS 2002; Postoperative complications",Article,Scopus

Here, we present a vision of rational drug design for cancer that is defined by two major components: modularity and image guidance. We suggest that modularity can be achieved by combining a nanocarrier and an oligonucleotide component into the therapeutic. Image guidance can be incorporated into the nanocarrier component by labeling with a specific imaging reporter, such as a radionuclide or contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging. While limited by the need for additional technological advancement in the areas of cancer biology, nanotechnology, and imaging, this vision for the future of cancer therapy can be used as a guide to future research endeavors. © 2017 Yoo, Billig and Medarova.","Cancer; Imaging; Nanomedicine; Rational; Therapy",Review,Scopus

In cancer cells, such regulation often becomes disconnected, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and an elevation in cellular stress. Consequently, cancer cells often lose homeostatic balance as they grow in unfavorable conditions, i.e. when nutrients and energy are limited yet mTORC1 is still aberrantly activated. Cancer cells lose signaling flexibility because of hyperactive mTORC1 that leads to heightened cellular stress and loss of nutrient and energy homeostasis, all of which are potential avenues for cancer therapy. Cancer cells often enhance mTORC1 to drive cell growth and proliferation, while also maintaining their survival. Autophagy regulation by mTORC1 is critically involved in nutrient and energy homeostasis, cell growth control, and survival. Studying mTORC1 and autophagy as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment has been the focus of a wide range of research over the past few decades.

Since PPIs are frequently used in cancer patients, studies investigating interactions between PPIs and anticancer agents are of particular importance to achieving effective and safe cancer chemotherapy. Several studies have revealed that PPIs inhibit not only the H+/K+-ATPase in gastric parietal cells, but also the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) overexpressed in tumor cells, as well as the renal basolateral organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) associated with pharmacokinetics and/or renal accumulation of various drugs, including anticancer agents. In this mini-review, we summarize the current knowledge regarding the impact of PPIs on the efficacy and safety of cancer chemotherapeutics via inhibition of targets other than the H+/K+-ATPase. Co-administration of clinical doses of PPIs protected kidney function in patients receiving cisplatin and fluorouracil, presumably by decreasing accumulation of cisplatin in the kidney via OCT2 inhibition. In addition, co-administration or pretreatment with PPIs could inhibit H+ transport via the V-ATPase in tumor cells, resulting in lower extracellular acidification and intracellular acidic vesicles to enhance the sensitivity of the tumor cells to the anticancer agents. In the present mini-review, we suggest that PPIs enhance the efficacy and safety of anticancer agents via off-target inhibition (e.g., of OCT2 and V-ATPase), rather than on-target inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase. The present findings should provide important information to establish novel supportive therapy with PPIs during cancer chemotherapy. © 2017 Ikemura, Hiramatsu and Okuda.","Drug interaction; Drug repositioning; Organic cation transporter 2; Proton pump inhibitor; Vacuolar H+-ATPase",Short Survey,Scopus

Methods: Several online databases were searched, and relevant articles were retrieved. Overall and subcategory meta-analyses were performed, and results were collated. Results: Twenty-seven articles, including 29 studies, were included, involving 4,852 cancer patients, and results showed that the above-baseline expression of TROP2 was significantly associated with poorer overall survival (OS) (pooled hazard ratio [HR]: 1.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.45–2.35), disease-free survival (DFS) (pooled HR: 2.77, 95% CI: 1.73–4.42), and progression-free survival (PFS) (pooled HR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.25–2.35).

GC represents a biologically and genetically diverse group of tumours with multifactorial aetiologies; both environmental and genetic. The vast majority of GCs are adenocarcinomas, which can be further subdivided into intestinal and diffuse histological subtypes according to the Lauren classification published in 1965. The molecular classification of GC according to the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) divides GC into four subtypes: tumours positive for the EBV virus (9%), microsatellite unstable tumours (22%), genomically stable tumours (20%) and tumours with chromosomal instability (CIN) at 50%. Most GCs are sporadic by nature, where approximately 10% appear to possess a familial predisposition of which around half can be attributed to hereditary germline mutations i.e. those of the E-cadherin (CDH1) or mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Histopathological characteristics of the tumour type and analysis of potential genetic changes have substantial clinical significance, as they determine the choice of treatment.

By evaluating the impact, outcomes and pedagogical influence of online cancer and education, future curricula can be shaped and delivered by higher education providers to better meet learner, health care provider and educational commissioners’ requirements for enhanced patient care and service delivery needs. Using the Kirkpatrick’s four-level model of educational evaluation, a systematic review of the effectiveness of online cancer education for nurses and allied health professionals was conducted. From 101 articles, 30 papers were included in the review. Educational theory is not always employed. There is an absence of longitudinal studies to examine impact; an absence of reliability and/or validity testing of measures, limited experimental designs taking account of power and few attempts to mitigate bias. There is, however, an emerging innovative use of mobile/spaced learning techniques. Evidence for clinical and educational effectiveness is weak offering insights into experiences and participant perceptions rather than concrete quantitative data and patient-reported outcomes.

The review focuses on analyzing experimental studies performed using different in vitro and in vivo models to identify the anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, anti-oxidant, cytotoxic, anti-metastatic, and NK-dependent cytotoxic effects exerted by TQ. In addition, we pinpoint the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects and the signal transduction pathways implicated by TQ. Our analysis show that p53, NF-κB, PPARγ, STAT3, MAPK, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways are among the most significant pathways through which TQ mediates its anti-cancer activity.

NF-κB signaling plays an important role during skeletal muscle atrophy and fat lipolysis. As an inhibitor of NF-κB signaling, Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) was reported to relieve cancer cachexia; however, its mechanism remains largely unknown. In our study, we showed that PDTC attenuated cancer cachexia symptom in C26 tumor bearing mice models in vivo without influencing tumor volume. What's more, PDTC inhibited muscle atrophy and lipolysis in cells models in vitro induced by TNFα and C26 tumor medium. PDTC suppressed atrophy of myotubes differentiated from C2C12 by reducing MyoD and upregulating MuRF1, and preserving the expression of perilipin as well as blocking the activation of HSL in 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes. Meaningfully, we observed that PDTC also inhibited p38 MAPK signaling besides the NF-κB signaling in cancer cachexia in vitro models. In addition, PDTC also influenced the protein synthesis of skeletal muscle by activating AKT signaling and regulated fat energy metabolism by inhibiting AMPK signaling. Therefore, PDTC primarily influenced different pathways in different tissues.

This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of artificial intelligence models for 5-year overall survival prediction in patients with cervical cancer treated by radical hysterectomy. Methods: The data set was collected from 102 patients with cervical cancer FIGO stage IA2-IIB, that underwent primary surgical treatment. Twenty-three demographic, tumor-related parameters and selected perioperative data of each patient were collected. The simulations involved six computational intelligence methods: the probabilistic neural network (PNN), multilayer perceptron network, gene expression programming classifier, support vector machines algorithm, radial basis function neural network and k-Means algorithm. The prediction ability of the models was determined based on the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, as well as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results of the computational intelligence methods were compared with the results of linear regression analysis as a reference model. Results: The best results were obtained by the PNN model. This neural network provided very high prediction ability with an accuracy of 0.892 and sensitivity of 0.975. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of PNN was also high, 0.818.

IGF-1 gene polymorphisms have been revealed to be correlated with the carcinogenesis and progression of solid malignancies. We therefore hypothesized that IGF-1 genetic polymorphisms might be associated with the risks and outcomes of osteosarcomas in Chinese individuals. Material/Methods: This study included 173 conventional osteosarcoma individuals and 175 tumor-free controls. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IGF-1 (rs6214, rs6218, rs35767, rs5742612, and rs5742714) were genotyped. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and analyzed for SNP genotyping using PCR. Results: We found that rs6218 had a predictive role for the susceptibility and progression of osteosarcoma. The presence of TC and CC genotypes of rs6218 indicated higher risk of osteosarcoma.

However, the prognostic value of HER2-HER3 overexpression remains unknown in gastric cancer (GC). Methods: The expression levels of HER2, HER3, Akt, p-Akt, mTOR and p-mTOR were examined in specimens from 120 GC patients by immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. The associations of HER proteins, PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway-related proteins, clinicopathological features of GC, and overall survival (OS) were assessed. To comprehensively evaluate the prognostic values of pathway-related proteins, meta-analyses were conducted with STATA 11.0. Results: HER2 overexpression was significantly associated with HER3 levels (P=0.02). HER3 was highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues. High HER2 and HER3 levels were associated with elevated p-Akt and p-mTOR amounts (P<0.05). Furthermore, HER2-HER3 co-expression was associated with high p-Akt and p-mTOR (P<0.05) levels. Meanwhile, p-mTOR overexpression was tightly associated with differentiation, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage and OS (P<0.05). By meta-analyses, Akt, p-Akt, and mTOR levels were unrelated to clinicopathological characters. HER3 overexpression was associated with depth of invasion (OR=2.39, 95%CI 1.62-3.54, P<0.001) and lymph node metastasis (OR=2.35, 95%CI 1.34-4.11, P=0.003). Further, p-mTOR overexpression was associated with patient age, tumor location, depth of invasion (OR=1.63, 95%CI 1.08-2.45, P=0.02) and TNM stage (OR=1.73, 95%CI 1.29-2.32, P<0.001). In addition, HER2-HER3 overexpression corresponded to gradually shortened 5-year OS (P<0.05), and significant relationships were shown among HER3, p-mTOR overexpression, and 1-, 3-, 5-year OS (P<0.05). Conclusions: HER2-HER3 co-expression may potentially enhance mTOR phosphorylation.

However, the clinical significance and biological role of Id-1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. Methods: We used RT-PCR, Western blot and Immunohistochemistry to measure Id-1 expression in NSCLC tissues and matched adjacent noncancerous tissues. The expression pattern of Id-1 in NSCLC tissues was determined by scoring system of immunohistochemical analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the survival curve, and log-rank test to determine statistical significance. The Id-1 gene was overexpressed or downreuglated with Lentiviral vectors in NSCLC cells. And, the migration ability of NSCLC cells was tested in a Transwell Boyden Chamber. Results: We found that Id-1 is generally expressed higher in NSCLC tissues compared with matched adjacent noncancerous tissues. We also found that high Id-1 expression in tumor tissues is significantly correlated with tumor progression and poor survival in NSCLC patients. Furthermore, our experimental data revealed that knockdown of Id-1 significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells, whereas ectopic expression of Id-1 promoted the malignant phenotype of NSCLC cells. Mechanistic study showed that NF-κB signaling pathway contributed to the effects of Id-1 in NSCLC cells. Moreover, blocking the NF-κB pathway significantly inhibited the tumor-promoting actions of Id-1 in NSCLC cells.

Currently, there is increasing focus on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which can act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) and suppress miRNA functions involved in post-transcriptional regulatory networks in the tumor. Therefore, to investigate specific mechanisms of TNBC carcinogenesis and improve treatment efficiency, we comprehensively integrated expression profiles, including data on mRNAs, lncRNAs and miRNAs obtained from 116 TNBC tissues and 11 normal tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas. As a result, we selected the threshold with |log2FC|>2.0 and an adjusted p-value >0.05 to obtain the differentially expressed mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs. Hereafter, weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed to identify the expression characteristics of dysregulated genes. We obtained five co-expression modules and related clinical feature. By means of correlating gene modules with protein–protein interaction network analysis that had identified 22 hub mRNAs which could as hub target genes. Eleven key dysregulated differentially expressed micro RNAs (DEmiRNAs) were identified that were significantly associated with the 22 hub potential target genes. Moreover, we found that 14 key differentially expressed lncRNAs could interact with the key DEmiRNAs. Then, the ceRNA crosstalk network of TNBC was constructed by utilizing key lncRNAs, key miRNAs, and hub mRNAs in Cytoscape software. We analyzed and described the potential characteristics of biological function and pathological roles of the TNBC ceRNA co-regulatory network; also, the survival analysis was performed for each molecule.

Hence, it is necessary and urgent to pay more attentions to the relevant study of predicting diseases associated miRNAs, which may be helpful for effective prevention, diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Especially, constructing computational methods to predict potential miRNA-disease associations is worthy of more studies because of the feasibility and effectivity. Methods: In this work, we developed a novel computational model of multiple kernels learning-based Kronecker regularized least squares for MiRNA-disease association prediction (MKRMDA), which could reveal potential miRNA-disease associations by automatically optimizing the combination of multiple kernels for disease and miRNA. Results: MKRMDA obtained AUCs of 0.9040 and 0.8446 in global and local leave-one-out cross validation, respectively. Meanwhile, MKRMDA achieved average AUCs of 0.8894 ± 0.0015 in fivefold cross validation. Furthermore, we conducted three different kinds of case studies on some important human cancers for further performance evaluation. In the case studies of colonic cancer, esophageal cancer and lymphoma based on known miRNA-disease associations in HMDDv2.0 database, 76, 94 and 88% of the corresponding top 50 predicted miRNAs were confirmed by experimental reports, respectively. In another two kinds of case studies for new diseases without any known associated miRNAs and diseases only with known associations in HMDDv1.0 database, the verified ratios of two different cancers were 88 and 94%, respectively. Conclusions: All the results mentioned above adequately showed the reliable prediction ability of MKRMDA. We anticipated that MKRMDA could serve to facilitate further developments in the field and the follow-up investigations by biomedical researchers. © 2017 The Author(s).","Disease; Kronecker regularized least squares; MiRNA; MiRNA-disease association; Multiple kernel learning",Article,Scopus

We used a Kras(G12D)-driven mouse model of lung cancer to establish an immune signature and identified a contribution of Gr1+ neutrophils to disease progression. Depletion experiments showed that Gr1+ cells (1) favor tumor growth, (2) reduce T cell homing and prevent successful anti-PD1 immunotherapy, and (3) alter angiogenesis, leading to hypoxia and sustained Snail expression in lung cancer cells. In turn, Snail accelerated disease progression and increased intratumoral Cxcl2 secretion and neutrophil infiltration. Cxcl2 was produced mainly by neutrophils themselves in response to a factor secreted by Snail-expressing tumor cells. We therefore propose a vicious cycle encompassing neutrophils and Snail to maintain a deleterious tumor microenvironment. Faget et al. extract an immune signature from lung tumors pointing to neutrophils as contributors to disease progression. They show that neutrophils inhibit immunotherapy efficacy and alter angiogenesis, increasing tumor hypoxia and Snail expression.

Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated improved patient outcomes with lenalidomide maintenance after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). Currently, single-agent lenalidomide is the only approved post-ASCT maintenance therapy in the United States and European Union for patients with NDMM. Areas covered: This review article summarizes the efficacy and safety data of lenalidomide maintenance, as monotherapy and in combination with other agents, following ASCT in patients with NDMM. In addition, emerging therapies with newer agents in this setting are discussed. Expert opinion: Following ASCT, maintenance therapy with lenalidomide until progressive disease is an effective and well-tolerated regimen and represents the standard of care for patients with NDMM. Studies evaluating maintenance with lenalidomide in combination with next-generation proteasome inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and histone deacetylase inhibitors may further improve patient outcomes. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Immunomodulatory; lenalidomide; maintenance therapy; multiple myeloma; stem cell transplant",Review,Scopus

CIP2A protein levels were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). One hundred and eighty-four of 209 (88.3%) primary stage I–III NSCLC specimens and 4 of 38 (10.5%) adjacent normal lung tissue specimens expressed CIP2A protein. High expression of CIP2A was detected in 38.8% (81/209) of the NSCLC specimens. Patients diagnosed histologically with late-stage NSCLC (p<0.001) and malignant nodes (p=0.001) exhibited high CIP2A expression. Univariate analysis using the log-rank test identified CIP2A expression as a prognostic predictor for overall survival (p=0.005). In multivariate analyses using the Cox regression test, CIP2A expression, T stage, N stage, histological type, and chemotherapy were identified as independent prognostic factors (p=0.007, 0.001, 0.003, <0.001, and <0.001, respectively). Furthermore, Kaplan–Meier survival curves demonstrated that high CIP2A expression indicated poor prognosis in the subgroup of patients with squamous cell carcinoma (p=0.008). Similar results were noted in the subgroup of patients with adenocarcinoma, but the results did not reach statistical significance (p=0.084). We also used univariate analysis and multivariate analysis to assess the prognostic factors for overall survival in the subgroup of patients who received postoperative chemotherapy. CIP2A expression was also an independent prognostic factor in NSCLC patients who received postoperative chemotherapy (p=0.009), along with histological type (p=0.001) and N stage (p=0.034). In conclusion, adding to the accumulating evidence, our research suggested that the CIP2A expression is associated with aggressiveness and correlates with poor prognosis in NSCLC. Our findings also indicated that CIP2A might be a potential therapeutic target against NSCLC. © 2017 Cha et al.","Chemotherapy; CIP2A; Immunohistochemistry; Non-small cell lung carcinoma; Prognosis; Radiotherapy",Article,Scopus

Four cytosine modifications (5mC, 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC) are produced and erased by a cyclic enzymatic cascade mediated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), ten-eleven translocation (TET) family enzymes and thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG). Stable maintenance of the DNA methylation profile is important for normal cell homeostasis, but its underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Methods: The expression levels of 7 DNA methylation-related enzymes from normal mouse tissues were assessed using quantitative real-Time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The gene expression data and related information of human normal tissues and tumor tissues were obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), respectively. Results: We observed significant positive correlations among the expression levels of DNA methylation-related enzymes in various mice and human normal tissues. By contrast, we found significantly decreased correlations in various tumor tissues compared with their corresponding normal tissues. Furthermore, we also found that alterations in these correlations are associated with several clinicopathological characteristics of cancer patients. Conclusions: These observations suggest that uncoordinated expression of DNA methylation-related enzymes is another epigenetic hallmark of cancer.

Recent developments including Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved molecular targeted agent’s pembrolizumab and cetuximab show promise but did not improve the five-year survival which is currently less than 40%. The hepatocyte growth factor receptor; also known asmesenchymal–epithelial transition factor (c-Met) and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are overexpressed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC); and regulates tumor progression and response to therapy. The c-Met pathway has been shown to regulate many cellular processes such as cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. The c-Met pathway is involved in cross-talk, activation, and perpetuation of other signaling pathways, curbing the cogency of a blockade molecule on a single pathway. The receptor and its ligand act on several downstream effectors including phospholipase C gamma (PLCγ), cellular Src kinase (c-Src), phosphotidylinsitol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt), mitogen activate protein kinase (MAPK), and wingless-related integration site (Wnt) pathways. They are also known to cross-talk with other receptors; namely epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and specifically contribute to treatment resistance. Clinical trials targeting the c-Met axis in HNSCC have been undertaken because of significant preclinical work demonstrating a relationship between HGF/c-Met signaling and cancer cell survival. Here we focus on HGF/c-Met impact on cellular signaling in HNSCC to potentiate tumor growth and disrupt therapeutic efficacy. Herein we summarize the current understanding of HGF/c-Met signaling and its effects on HNSCC. The intertwining of c-Met signaling with other signaling pathways provides opportunities for more robust and specific therapies, leading to better clinical outcomes. © 2017 by the authors.

Methods: Forty consecutive early-stage SAC patients at Hiroshima University Hospital were enrolled; SACs were classified into epithelial serration (Group A, n= 17) and non-epithelial serration (Group B, n=23) groups. Additionally, we classified serrated adenoma into 4 types: sessile serrated adenoma (SSA), traditional serrated adenoma (TSA), unclassified, and non-serrated adenoma type. Results: There were significant differences between Groups A and B in terms of tumor size (27.6 vs. 43.1 mm), incidences of T1 carcinoma (71% vs. 13%), and having the same color as normal mucosa (47% vs. 17%), respectively (p<0.01).

Though ANXA1 levels correlate with breast cancer disease status and outcome, its distinct functional involvement in breast cancer initiation and progression remains unclear. We hypothesized that ANXA1-responsive kinase signaling alteration and associated phosphorylation signaling underlie early events in breast cancer initiation events and hence profiled ANXA1-dependent phosphorylation changes in mammary gland epithelial cells. Methods: Quantitative phosphoproteomics analysis of mammary gland epithelial cells derived from ANXA1-heterozygous and ANXA1-deficient mice was carried out using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based mass spectrometry. Kinase and signaling changes underlying ANXA1 perturbations were derived by upstream kinase prediction and integrated network analysis of altered proteins and phosphoproteins. Results: We identified a total of 8110 unique phosphorylation sites, of which 582 phosphorylation sites on 372 proteins had ANXA1-responsive changes. A majority of these phosphorylation changes occurred on proteins associated with cytoskeletal reorganization spanning the focal adhesion, stress fibers, and also the microtubule network proposing new roles for ANXA1 in regulating microtubule dynamics. Comparative analysis of regulated global proteome and phosphoproteome highlighted key differences in translational and post-translational effects of ANXA1, and suggested closely coordinated rewiring of the cell adhesion network. Kinase prediction analysis suggested activity modulation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2), P21-activated kinase (PAK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and IΚB kinase (IKK) upon loss of ANXA1. Integrative analysis revealed regulation of the WNT and Hippo signaling pathways in ANXA1-deficient mammary epithelial cells, wherein there is downregulation of transcriptional effects of TEA domain family (TEAD) suggestive of ANXA1-responsive transcriptional rewiring. Conclusions: The phosphoproteome landscape uncovered several novel perspectives for ANXA1 in mammary gland biology and highlighted its involvement in key signaling pathways modulating cell adhesion and migration that could contribute to breast cancer initiation. © 2017 The Author(s).","Adhesion; Annexin-1; Breast cancer; Mammary epithelial cells; Network analysis; Phosphoproteomics; Proteomics",Article,Scopus

NOTCH regulates self-renewal and resistance to chemoradiotherapy in GBM stem cells. However, NOTCH-targeted γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) exhibited limited efficacy in GBM patients. We found that farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) significantly improved sensitivity to GSIs. This combination showed significant antineoplastic and radiosensitizing activities in GBM stem cells, whereas non-stem GBM cells were resistant. These combinatorial effects were mediated, at least partially, through inhibition of AKT and cell-cycle progression. Using subcutaneous and orthotopic GBM models, we showed that the combination of FTIs and GSIs, but not either agent alone, significantly reduced tumor growth. With concurrent radiation, this combination induced a durable response in a subset of orthotopic tumors. These findings collectively suggest that the combination of FTIs and GSIs is a promising therapeutic strategy for GBM through selectively targeting the cancer stem cell subpopulation. NOTCH-targeted agents may selectively compromise glioblastoma stem cells. In this article, Wang and colleagues demonstrate that farnesyltransferase inhibitors significantly augmented the sensitivity of glioblastoma stem cells to γ-secretase inhibitors and improved tumor growth control in xenograft models. This combination therapy also promoted radiosensitivity and resulted in a durable response in orthotopic glioblastoma models with concurrent radiation. © 2017 The Authors","farnesyltransferase inhibitors; glioblastoma stem cells; Notch; γ-secretase inhibitors",Article,Scopus

Germline alterations in its encoding gene (CDH1) are causative of HDGC and occur in about 40% of patients. Importantly, while in most cases CDH1 alterations result in the complete loss of E-cadherin associated with a well-established clinical impact, in about 20% of cases the mutations are of the missense type. The latter are of particular concern in terms of genetic counselling and clinical management, as the effect of the sequence variants in E-cadherin function is not predictable. If a deleterious variant is identified, prophylactic surgery could be recommended. Therefore, over the last few years, intensive research has focused on evaluating the functional consequences of CDH1 missense variants and in assessing E-cadherin pathogenicity. In that context, our group has contributed to better characterize CDH1 germline missense variants and is now considered a worldwide reference centre. In this review, we highlight the state of the art methodologies to categorize CDH1 variants, as neutral or deleterious. This information is subsequently integrated with clinical data for genetic counseling and management of CDH1 variant carriers. © 2017 by the authors.

Although prolidase has a role in collagen metabolism, it is also used to evaluate OS in many diseases. However, there is a lack of data about serum prolidase activity (SPA) in prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare SPA levels in males with BPH and PCa. Methods: Evaluation was made of a total of 81 men who underwent transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy for a definitive diagnosis due to high PSA levels. Patients were separated into 2 groups as BPH and PCa patients. Pre-biopsy malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), PSA levels and serum prolidase activities (SPA) were compared between the groups and the correlations of SPA with the other parameters were also investigated in both groups. Results: BPH was diagnosed in 51 patients and PCa in 30. The mean age of patients was similar in both groups as 63.25 ± 5.81 years in the BPH group 65.30 ± 7.35 years in the PCa group(p:0.081). The median MDA and SOD levels were insignificantly increased in the PCa patients. SPA values were similar in BPH and PCa patients. SPA did not correlate with age, PSA, MDA or SOD levels in either group. Conclusions: Our study results revealed that serum prolidase activity is similar in BPH and PCa cases and is not correlated with MDA, SOD or PSA levels. © 2017 The Author(s).","Benign prostatic hyperplasia; Oxidative stress; Prolidase; Prostate cancer",Article,Scopus

Previously, hormone therapy was used for the primary prevention of these chronic conditions. OBJECTIVE: To update evidence for the US Preventive Services Task Force on the benefits and harms of hormone therapy in reducing risks for chronic conditions. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and trial registries from June 1, 2011, through August 1, 2016. Surveillance for new evidence in targeted publications was conducted through July 1, 2017. STUDY SELECTION: English-language randomized clinical trials reporting health outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; meta-analyses when at least 3 similar studies were available. MAINOUTCOMES ANDMEASURES: Beneficial or harmful changes in risks for various chronic conditions. RESULTS: Eighteen trials (n = 40 058; range, 142-16 608; mean age, 53-79 years) were included. Women using estrogen-only therapy compared with placebo had significantly lower risks, per 10 000 person-years, for diabetes (-19 cases [95% CI, -34 to -3]) and fractures (-53 cases [95% CI, -69 to -39]). Risks were statistically significantly increased, per 10 000 person-years, for gallbladder disease (30 more cases [95% CI, 16 to 48]), stroke (11 more cases [95% CI, 2 to 23]), venous thromboembolism (11 more cases [95% CI, 3 to 22]), and urinary incontinence (1261 more cases [95% CI, 880 to 1689]). Women using estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo experienced significantly lower risks, per 10 000 person-years, for colorectal cancer (-6 cases [95% CI, -9 to -1]), diabetes (-14 cases [95% CI, -24 to -3), and fractures (-44 cases [95% CI, -71 to -13). Risks, per 10 000 person-years, were significantly increased for invasive breast cancer (9 more cases [95% CI, 1 to 19]), probable dementia (22 more cases [95% CI, 4 to 53]), gallbladder disease (21 more cases [95% CI, 10 to 34]), stroke (9 more cases [95% CI, 2 to 19]), urinary incontinence (876 more cases [95% CI, 606 to 1168]), and venous thromboembolism (21 more cases [95% CI, 12 to 33]).

Despite having potent anticancer properties, its potential in cancer treatment is hampered by reduced bioavailability that mainly due to its limited solubility in water. Several studies have been performed to improve its water solubility by way of encapsulation or entrapment in nanogels or nanoparticles. These are synthesized from classical chemistry methods that involve several toxic chemicals those are difficult to purify. This study explores a novel production method to prepare nanosized curcumin (nanocurcumins) in view of avoiding the use of chemical crosslinkers and accelerants. Micellar aggregates were first synthesized by random copolymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAM), vinyl pyrollidone (VP), and polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) using gamma radiation-induced polymerization. The micellar aggregates were then used to entrap curcumin in water to form nanocurcumins—making it readily soluble in water. An MTT assay test shows that lowest cell viability for MCF-7 and HEP-G2 cells was observed at 1,000 and 5,000 µM nanocurcumin concentration, respectively, while free curcumin had higher cell viability in almost all concentrations. The tests revealed that a comparable final product could be obtained using the gamma radiation-induced polymerization method. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Cancer; gamma irradiation; nanocurcumins; nanogels; nanomaterials",Article,Scopus

TIMP-2 diminishes the level of growth factor-mediated cell proliferation in vitro, as well as neoangiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo independent of its MMP inhibitory activity. These physiological properties make TIMP-2 an excellent candidate for further preclinical development as a biologic therapy of cancer. Here we present a straightforward bioprocessing methodology that yields &gt;35 mg/L recombinant human TIMP-2 6XHis-tagged protein (rhTIMP-2) from suspension cultures of HEK-293-F cells. Enhanced rhTIMP-2-6XHis yields were achieved by optimization of both TIMP-2 cDNA codon sequence and cell culture conditions. Using a two-step chromatographic process, we achieved &gt;95% purity with minimal processing losses. Purified rhTIMP-2-6XHis was free of mouse antigen contamination. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated a well-folded rhTIMP-2-6XHis that is highly stable and refractory to pH changes. Two-dimensional heteronuclear single-quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance of full length rhTIMP-2-6XHis also indicated a monodisperse, well-folded protein preparation. Purified rhTIMP-2-6XHis inhibited MMP-2 enzymatic activity in a dose-dependent fashion with an IC50 of ∼1.4 nM. Pretreatment of A549 lung cancer and JygMC(A) triple-negative breast cancer cells with rhTIMP-2-6XHis in low-nanomolar amounts inhibited EGF-induced proliferation to basal (unstimulated) levels. This study therefore not only offers a robust bioprocess methodology for rhTIMP-2 production but also characterizes critical physicochemical and biological attributes that are useful for monitoring quality control of the production process. © This article not subject to U.S. Copyright.

Among them, amplification or overexpression of ΔNp63 isoforms is observed in the majority of HNSCCs. Here, we unveiled a ΔNp63-dependent transcriptional program able to regulate the metabolism and the signaling of hyaluronic acid (HA), the major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM). We found that ΔNp63 is capable of sustaining the production of HA levels in cell culture and in vivo by regulating the expression of the HA synthase HAS3 and two hyaluronidase genes, HYAL-1 and HYAL-3. In addition, ΔNp63 directly regulates the expression of CD44, the major HA cell membrane receptor. By controlling this transcriptional program, ΔNp63 sustains the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGF-R) activation and the expression of ABCC1 multidrug transporter gene, thus contributing to tumor cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Importantly, p63 expression is positively correlated with CD44, HAS3, and ABCC1 expression in squamous cell carcinoma datasets and p63-HA pathway is a negative prognostic factor of HNSCC patient survival. Altogether, our data shed light on a ΔNp63-dependent pathway functionally important to the regulation of HNSCC progression.","HNSCC; Hyaluronic acid; p63",Article,Scopus

Methods: This prospective study evaluated simultaneous TB and SB for consecutive patients with suspicious lesions that were detected using pre-biopsy multiparametric MRI. A commercially available real-Time virtual sonography system was used to perform the MRI/US-fusion TB with the transperineal technique. The prostate imaging reporting and data system version 2 (PI-RADS v2) was assigned to categorize the suspicious lesions. Results: A total of 177 patients were included in this study. The detection rate for CSPC was higher using SB, compared to TB (57.1% vs 48.0%, p = 0.0886). The detection rate for CSPC was higher using the combination of TB and SB, compared to only SB (63.3% vs 57.1%, p = 0.2324).

OBJECTIVE: Assess the performance of automated deep learning algorithms at detecting metastases in hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections of lymph nodes of women with breast cancer and compare it with pathologists' diagnoses in a diagnostic setting. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Researcher challenge competition (CAMELYON16) to develop automated solutions for detecting lymph node metastases (November 2015-November 2016). A training data set of whole-slide images from 2 centers in the Netherlands with (n = 110) and without (n = 160) nodal metastases verified by immunohistochemical staining were provided to challenge participants to build algorithms. Algorithm performance was evaluated in an independent test set of 129 whole-slide images (49 with and 80 without metastases). The same test set of corresponding glass slides was also evaluated by a panel of 11 pathologists with time constraint (WTC) from the Netherlands to ascertain likelihood of nodal metastases for each slide in a flexible 2-hour session, simulating routine pathology workflow, and by 1 pathologist without time constraint (WOTC). EXPOSURES: Deep learning algorithms submitted as part of a challenge competition or pathologist interpretation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The presence of specific metastatic foci and the absence vs presence of lymph node metastasis in a slide or image using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The 11 pathologists participating in the simulation exercise rated their diagnostic confidence as definitely normal, probably normal, equivocal, probably tumor, or definitely tumor. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the algorithms ranged from 0.556 to 0.994. The top-performing algorithm achieved a lesion-level, true-positive fraction comparable with that of the pathologist WOTC (72.4% [95% CI, 64.3%-80.4%]) at a mean of 0.0125 false-positives per normal whole-slide image. For the whole-slide image classification task, the best algorithm (AUC, 0.994 [95% CI, 0.983-0.999]) performed significantly better than the pathologists WTC in a diagnostic simulation (mean AUC, 0.810 [range, 0.738-0.884]; P <.001). The top 5 algorithms had a mean AUC that was comparable with the pathologist interpreting the slides in the absence of time constraints (mean AUC, 0.960 [range, 0.923-0.994] for the top 5 algorithms vs 0.966 [95% CI, 0.927-0.998] for the pathologist WOTC). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the setting of a challenge competition, some deep learning algorithms achieved better diagnostic performance than a panel of 11 pathologists participating in a simulation exercise designed to mimic routine pathology workflow; algorithm performance was comparable with an expert pathologist interpreting whole-slide images without time constraints.

Two farmed varieties were studied, var. angustifolia (FD1) and var. deltoidea (FD2). Their crude methanolic extracts were partitioned into n-hexane (FD1h, FD2h) chloroform (FD1c, FD2c) and aqueous extracts (FD1a, FD2a). Antiproliferative fractions (IC50 < 30 μg/mL, SRB staining of PC3 cells) were further fractionated. Active compound/s were dereplicated using spectroscopic methods. In vitro mechanistic studies on PC3 and/or LNCaP cells included: annexin V-FITC staining, MMP depolarization measurements, activity of caspases 3 and 7, nuclear DNA fragmentation and cell cycle analysis, modulation of Bax, Bcl-2, Smac/Diablo, and Alox-5 mRNA gene expression by RT-PCR. Effects of cytotoxic fractions on 2D migration and 3D invasion were tested by exclusion assays and modified Boyden chamber, respectively. Their mechanisms of action on these tests were further studied by measuring the expression VEGF-A, CXCR4, and CXCL12 in PC3 cells by RT-PCR. FD1c and FD2c extracts induced cell death (P < 0.05) via apoptosis as evidenced by nuclear DNA fragmentation. This was accompanied by an increase in MMP depolarization (P < 0.05), activation of caspases 3 and 7 (P < 0.05) in both PC3 and LNCaP cell lines. All active plant extracts up-regulated Bax and Smac/DIABLO, down-regulated Bcl-2 (P < 0.05). Both FD1c and FD2c were not cytotoxic against normal human fibroblast cells (HDFa) at the tested concentrations. Both plant extracts inhibited both migration and invasion of PC3 cells (P < 0.05). These effects were accompanied by down-regulation of both VEGF-A and CXCL-12 gene expressions (P < 0.001). LC-MS dereplication using taxonomy filters and molecular networking databases identified isovitexin in FD1c; and oleanolic acid, moretenol, betulin, lupenone, and lupeol in FD2c. In conclusion, FD1c and FD2c were able to overcome three main hallmarks of cancer in PC3 cells: (1) apoptosis by activating of the intrinsic pathway, (2) inhibition of both migration and invasion by modulating the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis, and (3) inhibiting angiogenesis by modulating VEGF-A expression. Moreover, isovitexin is here reported for the first time as an antiproliferative principle (IC50 = 43 μg/mL, SRB staining of PC3 cells). © 2017 Hanafi, Afzan, Yaakob, Aziz, Sarmidi, Wolfender and Prieto.","Apoptosis; Ficus deltoidea; Invasion; LNCaP; Migration; PC3; Prostate cancer",Article,Scopus

Therefore, researchers have concentrated on developing realistic and sophisticated in-vitro 3D cell culture models that actually resemble the complex environment of native tissues. Calixarenes, similar to a ring basket, represent a third generation of supramolecular hosts could be promising candidates in this regard. Due to having a cyclic structure and large surface area, calixarenes, can be functionalized easily with polar and apolar groups, be a good carrier for cations, anions and neutral molecules. Electrospinning of p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene nanofibers with different functional groups were performed and their endothelial (Caco-2) and fibroblastic (L-929) cytocompatibility behaviour on cell adhesion function were examined. Cell attachment kinetics revealed that the Caco-2 and L-929 attached to the nanofibers functionalized with pyridinum at position 3 at the same rate as to tissue culture plates.

Circadian disruption is associated with a variety of diseases, especially cancer. Although some of the oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) are known as clock-controlled genes (CCGs), the analysis and annotation of circadian expression of most human oncogenes and TSGs are still lacking. This study aims to investigate the circadian expression of a list of human oncogenes and TSGs. Methods: A bioinformatic analysis was conducted on a gene library comprising 120 genes to investigate the circadian expression of human oncogenes and TSGs. To achieve this purpose, the genotranscriptomic data were retrieved from COSMIC and analyzed by R statistical software. Furthermore, the acquired data were analyzed at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels using several publicly available databases. Also, the significance of all analyses was confirmed statistically. Results: Altogether, our results indicated that 7 human oncogenes/TSGs may be expressed and function in a circadian manner. These oncogenes/TSGs showed a circadian expression pattern at CircaDB database and associated with at least one of the circadian genes/CCGs based on both genotranscriptomic and correlation analyses. Conclusions: Although 4 of 7 finally outputted genes have been previously reported to be clock controlled, heretofore there is no report about the circadian expression of 3 other genes. Considering the importance of oncogenes/TSGs in the initiation and progression of cancer, further studies are suggested for the identification of exact circadian expression patterns of these 3 human oncogenes/TSGs. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","bioinformatic analysis; circadian expression; Oncogenes; tumor suppressor genes (TSGs)",Article,Scopus

Dephosphorylation process is essential for organizing a huge number of cellular actions. In Drosophila, protein phosphatase 1 at B87 (Pp1-87B) gene encodes one of the four variants of the protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit and located on chromosome number three of Drosophila melanogaster. In this proposal, Pp1-87B mutation carrying lethal P-element insertions at a third chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster was screened to study the possible of this gene as tumor suppressor gene. Disruption of the genetic sequence of Pp1-87B gene can produce mutant phenotypes in the large clone mosaic eyes. The mutant eyes have either a rough or cell lethal phenotype which indicates the disrupted gene is essential for proper eye development. Further analysis of the mechanism by which these disrupted gene function may offer useful information for cancer studies. To study if the obtained set of Drosophila P-element mutations have a tumorigenic activity or not, a set of somatic clonal analysis in the whole body or in eye system was used. Thus, the lethal mutations were screened in some mosaic assays using clonal analysis systems. Our results showed that the studied gene may have a significant role in eye development, cell proliferation and could be involved in photoreceptor cell patterning, as well as in ommatidial differentiation and apoptosis. This gene which was determined in the present study could have a real impact on cancer development. © 2017 Koutb et al.","Clonal analysis; P-element insertions; Pp1-87B gene; Tumor suppressor gene",Article,Scopus

We present our experience integrating genomic data into the clinical management of children with high-risk hematologic malignancies and blood disorders and describe the broad impact that genomic profiling has in multiple aspects of patient care. Methods: The Precision in Pediatric Sequencing Program at Columbia University Medical Center instituted prospective clinical next-generation sequencing (NGS) for high-risk malignancies and blood disorders. Testing included cancer whole exome sequencing (WES) of matched tumor-normal samples or targeted sequencing of 467 cancer-associated genes, when sample adequacy was a concern, and tumor transcriptome (RNA-seq). A multidisciplinary molecular tumor board conducted interpretation of results and final tiered reports were transmitted to the electronic medical record according to patient preferences. Results: Sixty-nine samples from 56 patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies and blood disorders were sequenced. Patients carried diagnoses of myeloid malignancy (n = 25), lymphoid malignancy (n = 25), or histiocytic disorder (n = 6). Six patients had only constitutional WES, performed for a suspicion of an inherited predisposition for their disease. For the remaining 50 patients, tumor was sequenced with matched normal tissue when available. The mean number of somatic variants per sample was low across the different disease categories (2.85 variants/sample). Interestingly, a gene fusion was identified by RNA-seq in 58% of samples who had adequate RNA available for testing. Molecular profiling of tumor tissue led to clinically impactful findings in 90% of patients. Forty patients (80%) had at least one targetable gene variant or fusion identified in their tumor tissue; however, only seven received targeted therapy. Importantly, NGS findings contributed to the refinement of diagnosis and prognosis for 34% of patients. Known or likely pathogenic germline alterations were discovered in 24% of patients involving cancer predisposition genes in 12% of cases. Conclusion: Incorporating whole exome and transcriptome profiling of tumor and normal tissue into clinical practice is feasible, and the value that comprehensive testing provides extends beyond the ability to target-specific mutations. © 2017 Marks, Oberg, Pendrick, Sireci, Glasser, Coval, Zylber, Chung, Pang, Turk, Hsiao, Mansukhani, Glade Bender, Kung and Sulis.","Genomic; Hematologic malignancies; Next-generation sequencing; Pediatric leukemia; Targeted therapy",Article,Scopus

Nevertheless, transcriptional activation of EREs, including endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), is observed in somatic cells, variably upon cellular differentiation and frequently upon cellular transformation. ERE transcription is modulated during physiological and pathological immune cell activation, as well as in immune cell cancers. However, our understanding of the potential consequences of such modulation remains incomplete, partly due to the relative scarcity of information regarding genome-wide ERE transcriptional patterns in immune cells. Here, we describe a methodology that allows probing RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data for genome-wide expression of EREs in murine and human cells. Our analysis of B cells reveals that their transcriptional response during immune activation is dominated by induction of gene transcription, and that EREs respond to a much lesser extent. The transcriptional activity of the majority of EREs is either unaffected or reduced by B cell activation both in mice and humans, albeit LINEs appear considerably more responsive in the latter host. Nevertheless, a small number of highly distinct ERVs are strongly and consistently induced during B cell activation. Importantly, this pattern contrasts starkly with B cell transformation, which exhibits widespread induction of EREs, including ERVs that minimally overlap with those responsive to immune stimulation. The distinctive patterns of ERE induction suggest different underlying mechanisms and will help separate physiological from pathological expression. © 2017 Attig, Young, Stoye and Kassiotis.","Autoimmunity; B cell lymphoma; B lymphocyte activation; Cancer; Endogenous retroelements; Endogenous retroviruses; Genetic; Transcription",Article,Scopus

The prevalence and incidence of most chronic conditions, such as coronary heart disease, dementia, stroke, fractures, and breast cancer, increase with age; however, the excess risk for these conditions that can be attributed to menopause alone is uncertain. Since the publication of findings from the Women's Health Initiative that hormone therapy use is associated with serious adverse health effects in postmenopausal women, use ofmenopausal hormone therapy has declined. OBJECTIVE: To update the 2012US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on the use of menopausal hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions. EVIDENCE REVIEW: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harmsof systemic (ie, oral or transdermal) hormone therapy for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women and whether outcomes vary among women in different subgroups or by timing of intervention after menopause. The review did not address hormone therapy for preventing or treating menopausal symptoms. FINDINGS: Although the use of hormone therapy to prevent chronic conditions in postmenopausal women is associated with some benefits, there are also well-documented harms. The USPSTF determined that the magnitude ofboth the benefits and the harms of hormone therapy in postmenopausal womenissmallto moderate. Therefore, the USPSTF concluded with moderate certainty that combined estrogen and progestin has no net benefit for the primary prevention of chronic conditions for most postmenopausal women with an intact uterus and that estrogen alone has no net benefit for the primary prevention of chronic conditions for most postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION: The USPSTF recommends against the use of combined estrogen and progestin for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women.

Previously, we reported the exfoliation of graphene using proteins, and here we extend this approach to complex animal fluids. A kitchen blender with a high-turbulence flow gave high quality and maximum exfoliation efficiency in all sera tested, when compared to the values found with shear and ultrasonication methods. Raman spectra and electron microscopy confirmed the formation of three- or four-layer, submicrometer size graphene, independent of the serum used. Graphene prepared in serum was directly transferred to cell culture media without post-treatments. Contrary to many reports, a nanotoxicity study of this graphene fully dispersed to human embryonic kidney cells, human lung cancer cells, and nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) showed no acute toxicity for up to 7 days at various doses (50-500 μg/mL), but prolonged exposure at higher doses (300-500 μg/mL, 10-15 days) showed cytotoxicity to cells (∼95% death) and reproductive toxicity to C. elegans (5-10% reduction in brood size). The origin of toxicity was found to be due to the highly fragmented smaller graphene sheets (<200 nm), while the larger sheets were nontoxic (50-300 μg/mL dose). In contrast, graphene produced with sodium cholate as the mediator has been found to be cytotoxic to these cells at these dosages. We demonstrated the toxicity of liquid phase exfoliated graphene is attributed to highly fragmented fractions or nonbiocompatible exfoliating agents. Thus, low-toxicity graphene/serum suspensions are produced by a facile method in biological media, and this approach may accelerate the much-anticipated development of graphene for biological applications. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,Article,Scopus

Materials and Methods This multicenter prospective study included patients who received first-line bevacizumab-based chemotherapy. Tumor enhancement measured using CEUS within one liver metastasis and in relation to the surrounding healthy liver was quantified within 8 days before the first infusion of bevacizumab (E0), 24 hours after the end of the first infusion of bevacizumab (E1), in the 24 hours before the 2nd and 3rd infusion of bevacizumab on day 15 (E2) and day 30 (E3), respectively, and after 2 months of treatment (E4). Endpoints were tumor response using RECIST criteria at 2 months, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results Among the 137 patients included in this study, 109 were analyzed. Only CEUS parameters calculated in relation to healthy liver were significant. High wash-in and wash-out rates at baseline were significantly associated with a better tumor response. Increases over time E2-E0 and E3-E0 for peak enhancement were significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival. Increases over time E2-E0 and E3-E0 for peak enhancement and wash-in area under the curve were significantly associated with a shorter overall survival. Conclusion This large study demonstrated that early dynamic changes in the vascularity of liver metastases evaluated by quantified CEUS are associated with outcome in patients receiving first-line bevacizumab-based treatment for metastatic CRC. © 2018 Georg Thieme Verlag.

The polymeric nanoparticles (sizes narrowly distributed in a range less than 100 nm) were loaded with curcumin (CURC) with an encapsulation efficiency of 98% and drug loading (DL) content of 5–10% wtdrug/wtpolymer. The CURC-loaded nanoparticles were efficiently coated with a novel poly(sulfobetaine)-type zwitterionic polymer synthesized by nitroxide-mediated polymerization and postpolymerization functionalization step. Free and CURC formulated into noncoated and poly(sulfobetaine)-type zwitterionic polymer-coated nanoparticles were further investigated for cytotoxicity and antioxidant activity in a panel of human cell lines and rat liver microsomes, respectively. Formulated into coated NPs, CURC has superior cytotoxic and antioxidant activity versus the free drug and CURC incorporated in noncoated NPs. In addition, cell viability experiments of nonloaded nanoparticles, both coated and noncoated, demonstrated that developed nanoparticles are nontoxic, making them potentially suitable candidates for systemic passive targeting in cancer therapy, namely for treatment of solid tumors exhibiting high tumor accumulation of NPs due to enhanced permeability and retention effect. Polyzwitterion-coated nanoparticles exhibited slower drug release compared with the noncoated ones (half as much after 24 h) presumably due to the presence of the polymer shell around nanoparticles associated with a wider diffusion layer around the particles. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Aliphatic polyesters; biodegradable core-shell nanoparticles; cytotoxicity; drug delivery nanocarriers; poly(sulfobetaine)s",Article,Scopus

Recently, the large number of sequenced genomes has indicated that mammalian mutagenesis has a large stochastic component. As a result, large coding regions are large mutagen targets. Cytoskeletal protein-related coding regions (CPCRs), including extra-cellular matrix proteins, are among the largest coding regions in the genome and are indeed very commonly mutated in cancer. Methods: To determine whether mutagen sensitivity of the actin cytoskeleton could be assessed experimentally, we treated tissue culture cells with 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone and quantified overall cytoskeleton integrity with rhodamine-phalloidin stains for F-actin. Results: The above approach indicated cytoskeletal degradation with increasing mutagen exposure, consistent with increased mutagenesis of CPCRs in TCGA, smoker samples, where overall mutation rates correlate with CPCR mutation rates (R 2 = 0.8694; p &lt; 0.00001). In addition, mutagen exposure correlated with a decreasing cell perimeter to area ratio, raising questions about potential decreasing, intracellular diffusion and concentrations of chemotherapy drugs, with increasing mutagenesis and decreasing cytoskeleton integrity. Conclusion: Determination of cytoskeletal integrity may provide the opportunity to assess mutation burdens in nonclonal cell populations, such as in intact tissues, where DNA sequencing for heterogeneous mutation burdens can be challenging. © 2017 The Author(s).","Chemotherapy sequelae; Cytoskeleton; Mutation frequency; Smoking mutations",Article,Scopus

Methods: Four-dimensional computed tomography images from 30 liver cancer patients under thermoplastic mask immobilization were selected for this study. Three to seven surgical clips were placed in the resection cavity of each patient. The liver volume on computed tomography image was divided into the right upper (RU), right middle (RM), right lower (RL), hilar, and left lobes. Agreement between the clip and diaphragm motion was assessed by calculating intraclass correlation coefficient, and Bland–Altman analysis (Diff). Furthermore, population-based and patient-specific margins for internal motion were evaluated. Results: The clips located in the RU lobe showed the largest motion, (7.5±1.6) mm, which was significantly more than in the RM lobe (5.7±2.8 mm, p=0.019), RL lobe (4.8±3.3 mm, p=0.017), and hilar lobe (4.7±2.7 mm, p<0.001) in the cranial–caudal direction. The mean intraclass correlation coefficient values between the clip and diaphragm motion were 0.915, 0.735, 0.678, 0.670, and the mean Diff values between them were 0.1}0.8 mm, 2.3±1.4 mm, 3.1±2.0 mm, 2.4±1.5 mm, when clips were located in the RU lobe, RM lobe, RL lobe, and hilar lobe, respectively. The clip and diaphragm motions had high concordance when clips were located in the RU lobe. Internal margin can be reduced from 5 mm in the cranial–caudal direction based on patient population average and to 3 mm based on patientspecific margins. Conclusions: The motion magnitude of clips varied significantly depending on their location within the liver.

To this end, we evaluated levels of napsin A in epithelial lining fluid (ELF), since napsin A has been reported to be an immunohistochemical biomarker for histological diagnosis of primary lung adenocarcinoma. Methods: In consecutive patients with indeterminate peripheral lung nodules, ELF samples were obtained using a bronchoscopic microsampling (BMS) technique. The levels of napsin A and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in ELF at the nodule site were compared with those at the contralateral site. A final diagnosis of primary lung adenocarcinoma was established by surgical resection. Results: We performed BMS in 43 consecutive patients. Among patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma, the napsin A levels in ELF at the nodule site were markedly higher than those at the contralateral site, while there were no significant differences in CEA levels. Furthermore, in 18 patients who were undiagnosed by bronchoscopy and finally diagnosed by surgery, the napsin A levels in ELF at the nodule site were identically significantly higher than those at the contralateral site. In patients with non-adenocarcinoma, there were no differences in napsin A levels in ELF. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for identifying primary lung adenocarcinoma was 0.840 for napsin A and 0.542 for CEA.

However, the residual antitumor activity of curcumin-free turmeric (CFT) relative to curcumin or turmeric is not well-understood. In the present study, therefore, we determined activities of these agents in both in vitro and in vivo models of human HCT-116 colorectal cancer (CRC). When examined in an in vitro antiproliferative, clonogenic or anti-inflammatory assay system, we found that curcumin was highly active whereas turmeric and CFT had relatively poor activity against CRC cells. However, when examined in vivo at an oral dose of either 100 or 500 mg/kg given to nude mice bearing CRC xenografts, all three preparations of curcumin, turmeric, and CFT similarly suppressed the growth of the xenograft. The effect of CFT on suppression of tumor growth was dose-dependent, with 500 mg/kg tending to be more effective than 100 mg/kg. Interestingly, 100 mg/kg curcumin or turmeric was found to be more effective than 500 mg/kg. When examined in vivo for the expression of biomarkers associated with cell survival (cIAP-1, Bcl-2, and survivin), proliferation (Ki-67 and cyclin D1) and metastasis (ICAM-1 and VEGF), all were down-modulated. These agents also suppressed inflammatory transcription factors (NF-κB and STAT3) in tumor cells. Overall, our results with CFT provide evidence that turmeric must contain additional bioactive compounds other than curcumin that, in contrast to curcumin, exhibit greater anticancer potential in vivo than in vitro against human CRC. Moreover, our study highlights the fact that the beneficial effects of turmeric and curcumin in humans may be more effectively realized at lower doses, whereas CFT could be given at higher doses without loss in favorable activity. © 2017 Prasad, Tyagi, Siddik and Aggarwal.","Colorectal cancer; Curcumin; Curcumin-free turmeric; Turmeric; Xenograft",Retracted,Scopus

It is becoming clear, however, that cells and cellular processes cannot be considered in isolation. Best known for shuttling cytoplasmic content to the lysosome for degradation and repurposing of recycled building blocks such as amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids, autophagy serves a housekeeping function in every cell and plays key roles in cell development, immunity, tissue remodeling, and homeostasis with the surrounding environment and the distant organs.

Somatic alterations occur at relatively low frequencies whereas epigenetic changes at 11p15 are the most common aberration. We analyzed long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) methylation levels in the blastemal component of WT and normal kidney samples to explore their prognostic significance. Results: WT samples presented a hypomethylated pattern at all five CpG sites compared to matched normalkidney samples; therefore, the averaged methylation levels of the five CpG sites were used for further analyses. WT presented a hypomethylation profile (median 65.0%, 47.4-73.2%) compared to normal kidney samples (median 71.8%, 51.5-77.5%; p < 0.0001). No significant associations were found between LINE-1 methylation levels and clinical-pathological characteristics. We observed that LINE-1 methylation levels were lower in tumor samples from patients with relapse (median methylation 60.5%) compared to patients without relapse (median methylation 66.5%; p = 0.0005), and a receiving operating characteristic curve analysis was applied to verify the ability of LINE-1 methylation levels to discriminate WT samples from these patients. Using a cut-off value of 62.71% for LINE-1 methylation levels, the area under the curve was 0.808, with a sensitivity of 76.5% and a specificity of 83.3%. Having identified differences in LINE-1 methylation between WT samples from patients with and without relapse in this cohort, we evaluated other prognostic factors using a logistic regression model. This analysis showed that in risk stratification, LINE-1 methylation level was an independent variable for relapse risk: the lower the methylation levels, the higher the risk of relapse. The logistic regression model indicated a relapse risk increase of 30% per decreased unit of methylation (odds ratio 1.30; 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.57). Conclusion: Our results reinforce previous data showing a global hypomethylation profile in WT. LINE-1 methylation levels can be suggested as a marker of relapse after chemotherapy treatment in addition to risk classification, helping to guide new treatment approaches. © 2017 The Author(s).","Hypomethylation; LINE-1; Relapse; Wilms tumor",Article,Scopus

Furthermore, we describe a mechanism by which Shigella promotes its own invasion by altering the sumoylation state of RhoGDIα, a master negative regulator of RhoGTPase activity and actin polymerization.

Photoacoustic imaging, also called optoacoustic imaging, is a new biomedical technique based on laser-generated ultrasound, which combines the high contrast of optical imaging with the high spatial resolution of ultrasound. Since parameters appearing in the mathematical formulation of the photoacoustic problem are temperature dependent, their estimation can be used as indirect temperature measurement.

Such radiosensitizers can therefore be administered locally to enhance treatment efficiency within the solid tumor while protecting the neighboring tissue. When a solvated electron attaches to 8-bromoadenosine, a potential sensitizer, the dissociation of bromide leads to a reactive C8 adenosyl radical known to generate a range of DNA lesions. In the current work, we propose a multiscale computational approach to elucidate the mechanism by which this unstable radical causes further damage in genomic DNA. We employed a combination of classical molecular dynamics conformational sampling and QM/MM metadynamics to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of plausible reaction pathways in a realistic model, bridging between different time scales of the key processes and accounting for the spatial constraints in DNA. The obtained data allowed us to build a kinetic model that correctly predicts the products predominantly observed in experimental settings - cyclopurine and β-elimination (single strand break) lesions - with their ratio and yield dependent on the effective lifetime of the radical species. To date, our study provides the most complete description of purine radical reactivity in double stranded DNA, explaining the radiosensitizing action of electrophilic purines in molecular detail as well as providing a conceptual framework for the computational modeling of competing reaction pathways in biomolecules. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,Article,Scopus

Recently, miRNAs were demonstrated to be effectively delivered to a target cell or tissue from a host cell via extracellular vesicles (EVs). These EVs can be detected in blood, urine, exhaled breath condensates, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and other fluids. miRNAs are generated by donor cells and then packaged into EVs and delivered with intact functionality. After being delivered to the target cells, they regulate the translation of their target genes and the function of the target cells. Thus, EV transported miRNAs have become a new method for intercellular communication. EV miRNA transfer is well-documented in various pulmonary diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pulmonary hypertension, and acute lung injury (ALI). In this review, we summarize the novel findings of EV miRNA transfer, focusing on the roles of miR-210, miR-200, miR-17, miR-146a, miR-155, and other miRNAs that are transported from primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs), BALF, mesenchymal stem cells, and dendritic cells. © 2017 Chen, Hu and Pan.","Exosome; Extracellular vesicle; Lung disease; MicroRNA; Microvesicle",Review,Scopus

The study is aimed at detection of the anti-radiation effectiveness of ultradispersed nanodiamonds roduced by detonation synthesis during a general radiation damage of rats with a dose of 5.8 Gy. The study has been performed on the red blood cells of rats who received 1.0 ml of a suspension of nanodiamonds one time every 5 days prior to the irradiation. The suspension was diluted to C=0.01 % by distilled water or by saline to a final concentration of 0.9% NaCl. Blood sampling had been performed 30 days after irradiation. Investigation of changes in the dielectric properties and hydration of the red blood cells has been carried out by the method of microwave-dielectrometry at a frequency of 9.2 GHz. The results indicate that irradiation of rats results in an increase in the decrement of the static permittivity of the blood erythrocyte suspension by 37% with respect to those in the control group (intact rats). The degree of hydration of erythrocyte membranes in animals receiving nanodiamonds during the irradiation was found increased by 8.4%, relative to control, and decreased by 29% relative to irradiation without nanodiamons uptake.

In order to maintain cellular homoeostasis, a tight regulation between the synthesis and degradation of cellular components is essential. At the epicentre of the cellular nutrient sensing is the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) which connects environmental cues, including nutrient and growth factor availability as well as stress, to metabolic processes in order to preserve cellular homoeostasis. Under nutrient-rich conditions mTORC1 promotes cell growth by stimulating biosynthetic pathways, including synthesis of proteins, lipids and nucleotides, and by inhibiting cellular catabolism through repression of the autophagic pathway. Its close signalling interplay with the energy sensor AMP-Activated protein kinase (AMPK) dictates whether the cell actively favours anabolic or catabolic processes. Underlining the role of mTORC1 in the coordination of cellular metabolism, its deregulation is linked to numerous human diseases ranging from metabolic disorders to many cancers. Although mTORC1 can be modulated by a number of different inputs, amino acids represent primordial cues that cannot be compensated for by any other stimuli. The understanding of how amino acids signal to mTORC1 has increased considerably in the last years; however this area of research remains a hot topic in biomedical sciences. The current ideas and models proposed to explain the interrelationship between amino acid sensing, mTORC1 signalling and autophagy is the subject of the present review. © 2017 The Author(s).

Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a fibroproliferative disorder of an unknown etiology manifested by a progressive contracture of fingers. The basic method of the treatment is surgery. Among non-surgical treatments, radiotherapy (RT) represents a relevant method. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of palmar fascia irradiation in patients with Dupuytren's Disease. Material and methods. The research included a group of 117 patients with Dupuytren's disease irradiated in the Department of Radiotherapy in the Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology in Gliwice. Patients' medical records from the Institute of Oncology in Gliwice and the Provincial Hospital of Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery in Piekary Slaskie have been analysed retrospectively. The following were assessed: smoking history and the subjective evaluation of the effect of the therapy and its side effects before irradiation and check-up visits. All patients were irradiated to a total dose of 21 Gy given in 7 fractions. Results. After the RT, 35% of patients showed an improvement, in 58% of patients the disease progress stopped, whereas 7% of patients reported a deterioration. During the observation period, 7.5% of patients noted a deterioration of the contracture or the topical condition, in 35% stagnancy was observed, and 57.5% of patients showed a reduction of the contracture and an improvement in the topical condition. After the RT, 87.5% of patients had no side effects, in 7.5% there was a slight skin erythema, 2.5% had superficial epidermis exfoliation, and 2.5% reported dry skin. Conclusions. The obtained results allow one to conclude that palmar fascia irradiation is an effective method of treatment for patients with Dupuytren's disease and it is characterised by a low proportion of complications. © Polskie Towarzystwo Onkologiczne.","Dupuytren's Contracture; Dupuytren's Disease; Radiotherapy",Article,Scopus

Recurrent interventional therapies such as transcatheter arterial chemo-embolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and percutaneous ethanol injection have been reported previously utilized in a majority of SHC cases. To date, the exact pathogenic mechanisms underlying sarcomatoid transformation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown. Case presentation: In this study, we report a 68-year-old female SHC patient admitted to our hospital due to discrete abdominal distention for more than 20 days. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) with tri-phase enhancement revealed portal vein tumor thrombi (PVTT) and a left hepatic lobe lesion measuring 110.0 mm×160.0 mm. The patient subsequently underwent liver resection, after which pathological examination revealed proliferation of spindle-shaped SHC cells. A sarcomatoid, T4 stage carcinoma was eventually diagnosed. Forty-seven days after the operation, tri-phase enhanced CT detected extensive lesions in the liver, spleen, peritoneum, omentum majus, and mesentery, indicating SHC recurrence and metastases. Combination chemotherapy with pirarubicin and cisplatin was initiated for 1 cycle, but terminated due to resultant severe myelosuppression and medication intolerance. The patient was lost to therapy after 3 months of follow-up. Conclusions: This case is unique because of hepatitis C virus infection.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the hydration-mediated self assembly of these lipids that leads to the formation of nanostructures, which are attractive for use as vehicles for the delivery of drugs and functional foods. In the present study, we investigated the temperature-composition phase behaviour of eicosapentaenoic acid monoglyceride (MAG-EPA), which is one of the most investigated ω-3 PUFA monoglycerides, during a heating-cooling cycle in the temperature range of 5-60 °C. Experimental synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) evidence on the formation of a dominant inverse hexagonal (H2) lyotropic liquid crystalline phase and its temperature-induced transition to an inverse micellar solution (L2 phase) is presented for the fully hydrated bulk MAG-EPA system and its corresponding dispersion. We produced colloidal MAG-EPA hexosomes with an internal inverse hexagonal (H2) lyotropic crystalline phase in the presence of F127, a well-known polymeric stabilizer, or citrem, which is a negatively charged food-grade emulsifier. In this work, we report also on the formation of MAG-EPA hexosomes by vortexing MAG-EPA in excess aqueous medium containing F127 at room temperature. This low-energy emulsification method is different than most reported studies in the literature that have demonstrated the need for using a high-energy input during the emulsification step or adding an organic solvent for the formation of such colloidal nonlamellar liquid crystalline dispersions.

Previous data have shown that, in a non-enzymatic way, H. pylori urease (HPU) activates neutrophils to produce ROS and also induces platelet aggregation, requiring ADP secretion modulated by the 12-lipoxygenase pathway, a signaling cascade also triggered by the physiological agonist collagen. Here we investigated further the effects on platelets of recombinant versions of the holoenzyme HPU, and of its two subunits (HpUreA and HpUreB). Although HpUreA had no aggregating activity on platelets, it partially inhibited collagen-induced aggregation. HpUreB induced platelet aggregation in the nanomolar range, and also interfered dose-dependently on both collagen- and ADP-induced platelet aggregation. HPU-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited by antibodies against glycoprotein VI (GPVI), the main collagen receptor in platelets. Flow cytometry analysis revealed exposure of P-selectin in HPU-activated platelets. Anti-glycoprotein IIbIIIa (GPIIbIIIa) antibodies increased the binding of FITC-labeled HPU to activated platelets, whereas anti-GPVI did not. Evaluation of post-transcriptional events in HPU-activated platelets revealed modifications in the pre-mRNA processing of pro-inflammatory proteins, with increased levels of mRNAs encoding IL-1β and CD14. We concluded that HPU activates platelets probably through its HpUreB subunit. Activation of platelets by HPU turns these cells into a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Altogether, our data suggest that H. pylori urease, besides allowing bacterial survival within the gastric mucosa, may have an important, and so far overlooked, role in gastric inflammation mediated by urease-activated neutrophils and platelets. © 2017 Scopel-Guerra, Olivera-Severo, Staniscuaski, Uberti, Callai-Silva, Jaeger, Porto and Carlini.","CD14; Collagen receptor; GPVI; IL-1β; Inflammation; Lipoxygenase inhibitors; MRNA processing; Platelet aggregation",Article,Scopus

Because the specific proton beam dose distribution (i.e. the so-called 'Bragg curve'), proton radiotherapy ensures that the high-dose region is precisely confined to the target volume while minimizing the dose delivered to healthy tissues/critical organs surrounding the tumour or to those lying in the path of the proton beam. This method has been used for patients in Kraków since November 2016. Aim. To report the early tolerance outcomes to proton radiotherapy in patients completing their treatment just before the end of August 2017. Materials and methods. Study subjects were 47 patients who had completed their treatment before the end of August 2017 with a mean age of 41.6 years (range: 16-76, median: 40). The most frequent diagnoses were skull base tumours (22 pts. - 46.8%) and brain G1 or G2 gliomas (17 pts. - 36.2%), whereas the most frequent histological types were chordomas (17 pts. - 36.2%). Proton radiotherapy was administered by pencil beam scanning and consisted of using the intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) technique. The total dose given per cancer type averaged as follows: (i) 70 and 74 Gy(RBE), for respectively chodrosarcomas and chordomas, (ii) 54 Gy(RBE) for brain gliomas and (iii) 70 Gy(RBE) for paranasal sinuses tumours. Early tolerance was prospectively evaluated and measured according to the CTCAE scale, version 4.03. Results. In all, 91 side effects (SE) were recorded in 44 patients. The intensity of SEs were as following: 62 SEs (68.1%) were of grade 1 intensity, 21 SEs (23.1%) were of grade 2 and 8 SEs (8.8%) were of grade 3. The most frequently developed SEs were skin reactions (29 pts. - 61.7%) or oral/pharyngeal mucositis (20 pts. - 42.6%). Because the patient follow-up period was short, presented results only describes the early tolerance to this therapy. Our findings of mild intensities for the most early side effects, at (grades 1 or 2) are consistent with other published studies. © Polskie Towarzystwo Onkologiczne.","Early tolerance; Pencil beam scanning; Proton radiotherapy; Side effects",Article,Scopus

How STING signaling is attenuated during trafficking remains poorly understood. Here, we show that trafficking-mediated STING degradation requires ER exit and function of vacuolar ATPase complex. Late-stage STING vesicles are sorted to Rab7-positive endolysosomes for degradation. Based on analysis of existing structures, we also identified the helix amino acid 281 (aa281)–297 as a motif required for trafficking-mediated STING degradation. Immuno-electron microscopy (EM) reveals the size and clustering of STING vesicles and topology of STING on the vesicle. Importantly, blockade of trafficking-mediated STING degradation using bafilomycin A1 specifically enhanced cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP (cGAMP)-mediated immune response and anti-tumor effect in mice. Together, our findings provide biochemical and imaging evidence for STING degradation by the lysosome and pinpoint trafficking-mediated STING degradation as a previously unanticipated therapeutic target for enhancing STING signaling in cancer therapy. STING activation turns on and quickly turns off downstream signaling as it moves through the secretory pathway.

In contrast, another study in Denmark found that those bereaved by suicide had a lower risk of a number of physical health disorders, including cancers, diabetes, cardiovascular and chronic lower respiratory tract disorders compared to those bereaved by other causes of death. Additionally, a further study conducted in the United States found that suicide-bereaved children visited a GP less frequently than non-suicide bereaved children. Conclusions: Review findings are relevant for clinicians working with people bereaved by suicide as they highlight that such clients are at increased risk of several adverse physical health outcomes. Future research should examine health risk behaviours of suicide-bereaved and non-suicide bereaved family members as they may confound the association between exposure and outcome.

Cisplatin’s ototoxic effects are multifaceted, culminating in irreversible damage to the mechanosensory hair cells in the inner ear. Platinum drugs act on cancerous cells by forming nuclear DNA adducts, which may initiate signaling leading to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Moreover, it was reported that cisplatin may induce mitochondrial DNA damage in non-cancerous cells. Therefore, protecting mitochondria may alleviate cisplatin-induced insult to non-proliferating cells. Thus, it is important to identify agents that shield the mitochondria from cisplatin-induced insult without compromising the anti-tumor actions of the platinum-based drugs. In this study we tested the protective properties of mitochondrial division inhibitor, mdivi-1, a derivative of quinazolinone and a regulator of mitochondrial fission. Interestingly, it has been reported that mdivi-1 increases the apoptosis of cells that are resistant to cisplatin. The ability of mdivi-1 to protect hair cells against cisplatin-induced toxicity was evaluated in a fish model. Wild-type (Tübingen strain), cdh23 mutant, and transgenic pvalb3b::GFP zebrafish stably expressing GFP in the hair cells were used in this study. Larvae at 5–6 days post fertilization were placed in varying concentrations of cisplatin (50–200 μM) and/or mdivi-1 (1–10 μM) for 16 h. To evaluate hair cell’s viability the number of hair bundles per neuromast were counted. To assess hair cell function, we used the FM1-43 uptake assay and recordings of neuromast microphonic potentials. The results showed that mdivi-1 protected hair cells of lateral line neuromasts when they were challenged by 50 μM of cisplatin: viability of hair cells increased almost twice from 19% ± 1.8% to 36% ± 2.0% (p < 0.001). No protection was observed when higher concentrations of cisplatin were used. In addition, our data were in accord with previously reported results that functional mechanotransduction strongly potentiates cisplatin-induced hair cell toxicity. Together, our results suggest that mitochondrial protection may prevent cisplatin-induced damage to hair cells. © 2017 Vargo, Walker, Gopal, Deshmukh, McDermott, Alagramam and Stepanyan.","Cisplatin; Hair cells; Mdivi-1; Mechanotransduction; Mitochondria; Zebrafish",Article,Scopus

However, the role of DNA methylation at enhancers is not fully understood, although a crosstalk with chromatin marks is expected. Actually, there exist contradictory reports about positive and negative correlations between DNA methylation and H3K4me1, a chromatin hallmark of enhancers. Results: We investigated the relationship between DNA methylation and active chromatin marks through genome-wide correlations, and found anti-correlation between H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 enrichment at low and intermediate DNA methylation loci. We hypothesized ""seesaw"" dynamics between H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 in the low and intermediate DNA methylation range, in which DNA methylation discriminates between enhancers and promoters, marked by H3K4me1 and H3K4me3, respectively. Low methylated regions are H3K4me3 enriched, while those with intermediate DNA methylation levels are progressively H3K4me1 enriched. Additionally, the enrichment of H3K27ac, distinguishing active from primed enhancers, follows a plateau in the lower range of the intermediate DNA methylation level, corresponding to active enhancers, and decreases linearly in the higher range of the intermediate DNA methylation. Thus, the decrease of the DNA methylation switches smoothly the state of the enhancers from a primed to an active state. We summarize these observations into a rule of thumb of one-out-of-three methylation marks: ""In each genomic region only one out of these three methylation marks (DNA methylation, H3K4me1, H3K4me3) is high. If it is the DNA methylation, the region is inactive. If it is H3K4me1, the region is an enhancer, and if it is H3K4me3, the region is a promoter"". To test our model, we used available genome-wide datasets of H3K4 methyltransferases knockouts. Our analysis suggests that CXXC proteins, as readers of non-methylated CpGs would regulate the ""seesaw"" mechanism that focuses H3K4me3 to unmethylated sites, while being repulsed from H3K4me1 decorated enhancers and CpG island shores. Conclusions: Our results show that DNA methylation discriminates promoters from enhancers through H3K4me1-H3K4me3 seesaw mechanism, and suggest its possible function in the inheritance of chromatin marks after cell division. Our analyses suggest aberrant formation of promoter-like regions and ectopic transcription of hypomethylated regions of DNA. Such mechanism process can have important implications in biological process in where it has been reported abnormal DNA methylation status such as cancer and aging. © 2017 The Author(s).","Computational epigenomics; DNA methylation; Enhancers; H3K4me1; H3K4me3; Histone modifications; Next generation sequencing; Promoters",Article,Scopus

These findings were corroborated by overexpression of plasma membrane nutrient transporters, such as the glucose transporters (GLUTs) and some amino acid transporters such as ASCT2, LAT1, and ATB0,+, which became promising targets for pharmacological intervention. On the basis of their sodium-dependent transport modes, ASCT2 and ATB0+ have the capacity to sustain glutamine need of cancer cells; while LAT1, which is sodium independent will have the role of providing cancer cells with some amino acids with plausible signaling roles. According to the metabolic reprogramming of many types of cancer cells, glucose is mainly catabolized by aerobic glycolysis in tumors, while the fate of Glutamine is completed at mitochondrial level where the enzyme Glutaminase converts Glutamine to Glutamate. Glutamine rewiring in cancer cells is heterogeneous. For example, Glutamate is converted to α-Ketoglutarate giving rise to a truncated form of Krebs cycle. This reprogrammed pathway leads to the production of ATP mainly at substrate level and regeneration of reducing equivalents needed for cells growth, redox balance, and metabolic energy. Few studies on hypothetical mitochondrial transporter for Glutamine are reported and indirect evidences suggested its presence. Pharmacological compounds able to inhibit Glutamine metabolism may represent novel drugs for cancer treatments. Interestingly, well acknowledged targets for drugs are the Glutamine transporters of plasma membrane and the key enzyme Glutaminase. © 2017 Scalise, Pochini, Galluccio, Console and Indiveri.","Drug design; Metabolism; Mitochondria; Plasma membrane; Proteoliposome; Tumors",Short Survey,Scopus

Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) is one of the metabolites that is derived from arachidonic acid and that is catalyzed by 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX), and it has recently been reported to exhibit anti-cancer effects. However, the role of LXA4 in pancreatic cancer remains to be elucidated. Methods: Pancreatic cell lines were treated with vehicle or LXA4, and the invasive capacity was then assessed by Transwell assays. The expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers was determined by western blotting and immunofluorescence. Anti-TGF-β1 neutralizing antibody and exogenous recombinant human TGF-β1 (rhTGF-β1) were used to study the effect of LXA4 on the TGF-β signaling. A liver metastasis model was applied to investigate the effect of LXA4 in vivo. The correlation between the Lipoxin effect score (LES) and the clinical-pathological features of pancreatic cancer was also analyzed. Results: We found that in patients with pancreatic cancer, low LES was correlated with aggressive metastatic potential. The LXA4 activity, which was mediated by the LXA4 receptor FPRL1, could significantly suppress invasion capacity and mesenchymal phenotypes. The expression and autocrine signaling pathway activity of TGF-β1 were also downregulated by LXA4. In the liver metastasis model in nude mice, the stable analog of LXA4, BML-111, could inhibit the metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that LXA4 could reverse mesenchymal phenotypes, which attenuated invasion and metastasis via the inhibition of autocrine TGF-β1 signaling in pancreatic cancer, which may provide a new strategy to prevent the metastasis of pancreatic cancer. © 2017 The Author(s).","Invasion and metastasis; Lipoxin A4; Mesenchymal phenotypes; Pancreatic cancer; TGF-β1",Article,Scopus

VLPs labeled internally on cysteine residues were taken up with high efficiency by several cancer cell lines and were colocalized with the endolysosomal marker LAMP-1 within 6 h, whereas VLPs labeled externally on lysine residues were taken up with lower efficiency, probably reflecting differences in surface charge and the propensity to bind to the cell surface.

Methods: From 1990 to 2010, a total of 3,769 patients with stage IB1 and IIA1 cervical SCC were included from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database and were stratified according to whether they received radical hysterectomy or primary radiochemotherapy. Propensity score-matching (PSM) methods were used to balance patient baseline characteristics. Cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between the two groups. Results: Of the 3,769 patients, 3,653 (96.9%) and 116 (3.1%) patients received radical hysterectomy and definitive radiochemotherapy, respectively. Radiochemotherapy was rarely used for definitive treatment prior to 2000. Before PSM, patients who were older, of black ethnicity, and with larger tumor size and stage IIA1 disease were more likely to receive definitive radiochemotherapy. A total of 116 pairs were completely matched using PSM. The local treatment modalities had no effect on CSS or OS in either unmatched or matched populations. In the matched population, the 8-year CSS rates were 82.1% and 76.5% in surgery and radiochemotherapy groups, respectively (p=0.382). The 8-year OS rates were 74.6% and 67.8% in surgery and radiochemotherapy groups, respectively (p=0.205). Conclusion: Our population-based study suggests that there is no clear local treatment of choice on survival outcomes between radical hysterectomy and definitive radiochemotherapy in patients with stage IB1 and IIA1 cervical SCC. © 2017 Wu et al.","Cervical cancer; Early stage; Hysterectomy; Propensity score matching; Radiotherapy",Article,Scopus

Methods: Breast tumor samples were analyzed for PAM50 subtype and for eight genes previously found to be differentially expressed by race and associated with breast cancer survival: ACOX2, MUC1, FAM177A1, GSTT2, PSPH, PSPHL, SQLE, and TYMS. The expression of these genes according to race was assessed using linear regression and each gene was evaluated in association with recurrence using Cox regression. Results: Compared to white women, black women had lower expression of MUC1, a suspected good prognosis gene, and higher expression of GSTT2, PSPHL, SQLE, and TYMS, suspected poor prognosis genes, after adjustment for age and PAM50 subtype. High expression (greater than median versus less than or equal to median) of FAM177A1 and PSPH was associated with a 63% increase (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.09-2.46) and 76% increase (HR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.15-2.68), respectively, in risk of recurrence after adjustment for age, race, PAM50 subtype, and ROR-PT score. Log 2 -transformed SQLE expression was associated with a 20% increase (HR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.03-1.41) in recurrence risk after adjustment. A continuous multi-gene score comprised of eight genes was also associated with increased risk of recurrence among all women (HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.04-1.19) and among white (HR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.03-1.27) and black (HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.02-1.20) women.

Castration resistance involves reactivation of androgen signaling or activation of alternative lineage programs to bypass androgen requirement. We describe an aberrant gastrointestinal-lineage transcriptome expressed in ∼5% of primary prostate cancer that is characterized by abbreviated response to androgen-deprivation therapy and in ∼30% of castration-resistant prostate cancer. This program is governed by a transcriptional circuit consisting of HNF4G and HNF1A. Cistrome and chromatin analyses revealed that HNF4G is a pioneer factor that generates and maintains enhancer landscape at gastrointestinal-lineage genes, independent of androgen-receptor signaling. In HNF4G/HNF1A-double-negative prostate cancer, exogenous expression of HNF4G at physiologic levels recapitulates the gastrointestinal transcriptome, chromatin landscape, and leads to relative castration resistance. Shukla et al. identify an aberrantly expressed gastrointestinal-lineage transcriptome governed by HNF4G and HNF1A in ∼30% of castration-resistant prostate cancer.

CAT-Gel offers a unique blend of material properties such as injectability and self-healing along with useful biological attributes like their noncytotoxic and nonhemolytic nature. The amphipathic nature of this hydrogel enabled us to incorporate a recipe of hydrophilic doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) and hydrophobic docetaxel (DTX) anticancer drugs. Rheology studies confirmed the self-healing nature of this chimeric hydrogel even after drug loading. CAT-Gel was retained for more than 40 days in mice upon subcutaneous injection. The sequential and sustained release of the entrapped DOX and DTX from the hydrogel resulted in synergistic therapeutic effect with increased median survival against murine lung and breast cancer models.

Herein, we developed a mitochondria-targeted cyanine dye IR825-Cl, which possesses two separated excitation wavelength channels for both red fluorescence imaging and near-infrared (NIR) photothermal therapy (PTT). For imaging, IR825-Cl rapidly entered cells and selectively targeted mitochondria. Although IR825-Cl was completely quenched in water, interestingly, this dye had a turn-on response of red fluorescence (610 nm) in mitochondria under 552 nm excitation due to its polarity-responsive fluorescence emission. More interestingly, IR825-Cl realized the selective mitochondrial staining of cancer cells over normal cells and thus served as an ideal fluorescent probe for identifying cancer cells in normal tissues, which is extremely beneficial for cancer theranostics. For PTT, we demonstrated that under 808 nm NIR laser irradiation, this dye efficiently converted optical energy into heat, realizing mitochondria-targeted photothermal cancer therapy. Collectively, this molecule realized both high fluorescence emission (quantum yield > 43%) and effective light-to-heat conversion (17.4%), enabling its applications for wash-free fluorescence imaging for mitochondria and highly efficient fluorescence imaging-guided PTT. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","cell differentiation; mitochondrial imaging/tracking; near-infrared heptamethine cyanine dye; photothermal therapy; turn-on response of visible light fluorescence",Article,Scopus

Herein, we aimed to investigate the expression changes of miR-149* and GIT1 and the functional effects of miR-149*/GIT1 link in breast cancer. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot (WB) were used to examine the expression levels of miR-149* and GIT1. Dual luciferase reporter assay was utilized to confirm the target interaction between miR-149* and GIT1. The biological functions, including cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, of miR-149* and GIT1 were determined by MTT assay and Transwell assays, respectively. Eventually, the tumor xenograft model in nude mice injected with stable transfected MDA-MB-231 cells was established to verify the effects of miR-149* and GIT1 on tumor growth. Our results showed that miR-149* expression was decreased, whereas GIT1 expression was increased in clinical samples of breast cancer. Based on the inverse expression trend between miR-149* and GIT1, we further demonstrated that miR-149* indeed directly targets GIT1. Subsequently, it was observed that inhibition of miR-149* significantly promoted cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, but the ability of cell proliferation, invasion, and migration was obviously declined after silencing of GIT1 in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with miR-149* mimic and/or si-GIT1. Finally, it was also found that elevated miR-149* decelerated the tumor growth, while restored GIT1 accelerated the tumor growth in nude mice after 35 days of tumor xenograft.

It is used for the treatment of a variety of cancers such as cervical, breast, stomach, prostate, bladder and oesophageal, to name a few. However due to its expansive toxicity profile, patients receiving cisplatin can experience high frequency hearing loss, a side effect known as ototoxicity. The dearth of information on the extent and severity of cisplatin-associated ototoxicity in South Africa prevents the implementation of a context-specific audiological monitoring programme. Methods: This study aims to determine the extent and severity of ototoxicity amongst patients with cervical cancer, receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy and hence the feasibility of an ototoxicity monitoring program in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. A concurrent mixed methods design will be employed in the study. This longitudinal study will involve interviewing oncology nurses, oncologists, pharmacists and audiologists to assess the level of awareness to ototoxicity, as well as conducting diagnostic audiological evaluations at regular intervals on 78 patients with cervical cancer to ascertain the progression of hearing loss during and after chemotherapy. The feasibility of the monitoring program will be assessed as a parallel process to the audiological evaluations, where patient outcomes and cost implications to the patient and the health sector will be considered. Data will be subjected to statistical analyses so as to strengthen knowledge in the field and inform appropriate policies, and healthcare providers. Discussion: This study is the first longitudinal study in South Africa to determine the ototoxic effects of cisplatin therapy on patients diagnosed with cervical cancer. Thus, the results generated from this study is likely to bring novel information to the fore using an evidence-based approach that will influence policy and clinical practice which can vastly improve the quality of life of patients undergoing chemotherapy. Mitigation of any further loss in the quality of life of affected patients is of paramount importance and the data generated from this project can lay the basis for further effective dialogue towards policy formulation on an ototoxic monitoring programme and the resultant strengthening of health systems in limited resource settings. © 2017 The Author(s).","Audiology; Cervical cancer; Cisplatin; Hearing loss; Ototoxicity; Quality of life",Article,Scopus

Then, the roles of UHRF2 in ICC were investigated by UHRF2 interference. Moreover, the relationship between UHRF2 and E-cadherin expression was examined in ICC cells and samples. Finally, the prognostic role of UHRF2 in ICC was analyzed in 139 ICC patients by Cox regression and Kaplan–Meier methods. We found UHRF2 was overexpressed in multiple human cancers, as well as in ICC, and the invasion, migration, proliferation, and antiapoptosis of ICC cells were inhibited by UHRF2 interference. Moreover, the epithelial–mesenchymal transition-related marker E-cadherin was upregulated in ICC cells which was influenced by UHRF2 expression. Clinically, UHRF2 expression was positively associated with microvascular invasion and lymphatic metastasis of ICC, and patients in the UHRF2 high group had much lower overall survival and higher recurrence rates than patients in the UHRF2 low group. A multivariate analysis revealed that UHRF2 overexpression was a new prognostic marker for ICC.

Several studies have shown premalignant lesions gastric atrophy (GA) and intestinal metaplasia (IM) influence gastric cancer risk. This systematic review examines all available evidence of the risk of GC in patients with GA or IM and explores the geographical variation between countries. Methods: EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant articles published to June 2016 investigating the risk of GC in individuals with GA or IM. Analysis was performed to determine variation based on geographical location. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and heterogeneity between studies was also evaluated. Results: Fifteen relevant articles were identified, in which there were eight studies of GC incidence in GA and nine in IM cohorts (two articles investigated both GA and IM). The incidence rate of GC in patients with GA ranged from 0.53 to 15.24 per 1000 person years, whereas there was more variation in GC incidence in patients with IM (0.38 to 17.08 per 1000 person years). The greatest GC incidence rates were in Asian countries, for patients with GA, and the USA for those with IM (15.24 and 17.08 per 1000 person years, respectively). The largest studies (four over 25,000 person years) had an incidence rate range of 1.0-2.5 per 1000 person years, however, in general, study quality was poor and there was marked heterogeneity. Conclusion: Overall there is a wide variation in annual incidence rate of GC from premalignant lesions. With the recent introduction of surveillance guidelines for gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia in the Western world, future assessment of this risk should be performed. Furthermore, substantial heterogeneity supports the need for more robust studies in order to pool results and determine the overall incidence rate of gastric cancer for patients with these premalignant lesions. © 2017 The Author(s).","Gastric atrophy; Gastric cancer; Intestinal metaplasia; Premalignant; Progression",Article,Scopus

Recently, we described a monocyte-targeting peptide amphiphile micelle (MCP-1 PAM) incorporated with the chemokine receptor CCR2 binding motif of MCP-1, which has a high affinity for monocytes in atherosclerotic plaques. We further report here the biomimetic components of MCP-1 PAMs and the influence of the nanoparticle upon binding to monocytes. We report that MCP-1 PAMs have enhanced secondary structure compared to the MCP-1 peptide. As a result, MCP-1 PAMs displayed improved binding and chemoattractant properties to monocytes, which upregulated the inflammatory signaling pathways responsible for monocyte migration. Interestingly, when MCP-1 PAMs were incubated in the presence of prostate cancer cells in vitro, the particle displayed anticancer efficacy by reducing CCR2 expression. Given that monocytes play an important role in tumor cell migration and invasion, our results demonstrate that PAMs can improve the native biofunctional properties of the peptide and may be used as an effective inhibitor to prevent chemokine-receptor interactions that promote disease progression. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","atherosclerosis; monocyte; nanoparticle; peptide; peptide amphiphile micelle; prostate cancer",Article,Scopus

Despite the fact that metastasis to the brain poses a unmet clinical problem, with afflicted patients carrying significant morbidity and a fatal prognosis, our knowledge as to how metastatic cells manage to adapt to the tissue environment of the CNS remains limited. Answering this question could pave the way for novel and more specific therapeutic modalities in brain metastasis by targeting the specific makeup of the brain metastatic niche. In regard to this, astrocytes have emerged as the major host cell type that cancer cells encounter and interact with during brain metastasis formation. Similarly to other CNS disorders, astrocytes become reactive and respond to the presence of cancer cells by changing their phenotype and significantly influencing the outcome of disseminated cancer cells within the CNS. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the contribution of reactive astrocytes in brain metastasis by focusing on the signaling pathways and types of interactions that play a crucial part in the communication with cancer cells and how these could be translated into innovative therapies. © 2017 Wasilewski, Priego, Fustero-Torre and Valiente.","Astrocyte signaling; Brain metastasis; Metastases therapy; Microenvironment heterogeneity; Reactive astrocytes",Review,Scopus

The obtained PEGylated CaP/Au NR assemblies possess many virtues including outstanding drug-loading capacity, excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (η, ∼38.5%), pH/near-infrared (NIR) dual-responsive release property, and good biocompatibility. After loading doxorubicin (DOX) in PEGylated CaP/Au NR assemblies, the DOX-loaded PEGylated CaP/Au NR assemblies can simultaneously supply intense heating effect and increased DOX release under 808 nm NIR laser, achieving excellent antitumor therapeutic effect in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the combination of DOX-loading and photothermal treatment upon PEGylated CaP/Au NR assemblies displays better therapeutic effect than single chemotherapy or photothermal therapy. Furthermore, the comprehensive methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT), hemolysis, and histological assays manifest no obvious toxicity of PEGylated CaP/Au NR assemblies.

Using medicinal plants for the prevention of chronic diseases such as cancer constitutes new alternatives in traditional medicine. Oenothera rosea (OR) could be an option, but it needs to be evaluated. Aim: The main objective of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of OR extract on N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (NMU)-induced GC in rats. Methods: In total, 80 male Holtzman rats were randomized into five groups. Group A received the saline solution (5mL/kg), group B received NMU 500 μg/kg (cancer inductor) by oral administration for 16 weeks, and groups C, D, and E were treated with OR extract (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg, respectively) and NMU in order to evaluate the preventive effect on cancer induced by NMU for 16 weeks. Blood and histological samples of stomachs were collected to determine histopathological, biochemical, and hematological parameters between different experimental groups. Results: Groups C, D, and E presented less histopathological changes such as anaplastic and hyperplastic cells, compared with group B. Hematological and biochemical parameters were recorded, and superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, and nitric oxide levels were statistically less than those of NMU group (P<0.05, P<0.01, and P<0.01). Conclusion: Considering the histopathological signs and the antioxidant activity in vivo as well as hematological and biochemical parameters of ethanolic extract of OR, we concluded that its administration in rats has a protective effect on GC, which is induced experimentally.

We describe an mTOR-driven mouse model that displays hepatosteatosis progressing to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Longitudinal proteomic, lipidomics, and metabolomic analyses revealed that hepatic mTORC2 promotes de novo fatty acid and lipid synthesis, leading to steatosis and tumor development. In particular, mTORC2 stimulated sphingolipid (glucosylceramide) and glycerophospholipid (cardiolipin) synthesis. Inhibition of fatty acid or sphingolipid synthesis prevented tumor development, indicating a causal effect in tumorigenesis. Increased levels of cardiolipin were associated with tubular mitochondria and enhanced oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, increased lipogenesis correlated with elevated mTORC2 activity and HCC in human patients. Thus, mTORC2 promotes cancer via formation of lipids essential for growth and energy production. Guri et al. find that mTORC2 promotes de novo fatty acid and lipid synthesis. This pathway is elevated in human liver cancer and drives hepatosteatosis and liver cancer in mice, whereas its inhibition or deletion of Rictor reduces mouse tumors, suggesting this pathway as a therapeutic target in liver cancer. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","cardiolipin; glycosphingolipid; hepatocellular carcinoma; hepatosteatosis; mitochondria; mTOR; NAFLD; NASH; oxidative phosphorylation; sphingolipid",Article,Scopus

Here we describe a mechanism of EGFR regulation through the importin β family member RAN-binding protein 6 (RanBP6), a protein of hitherto unknown functions. We show that RanBP6 silencing impairs nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), reduces STAT3 binding to the EGFR promoter, results in transcriptional derepression of EGFR, and increased EGFR pathway output.

Recently, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) NEAT1 has been determined as an oncogenic gene in a variety of cancers. However, the effect of NEAT1 in NPC and its underlying mechanism have not been well elaborated. In this study, the data showed that NEAT1 was upregulated and miR-124 was downregulated in NPC tissues and cells. Loss-of-function revealed that NEAT1 knockdown inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of NPC cells while gain-of-function revealed that upregulated NEAT1 showed an opposite effect. Moreover, NEAT1 was demonstrated to suppress miR-124 expression by direct interaction in NPC cells. Additionally, miR-124 reversed NEAT1-mediated pro-proliferation and anti-apoptosis effect. Furthermore, miR-124 regulated NPC cell proliferation and apoptosis via NF-κB signal pathway. Mouse models of NPC confirmed that NEAT1 overexpression facilitated tumor growth by modulating miR-124 in vivo. Taken together, this study indicated that upregulated NEAT1 promoted the tumorigenesis and progression of NPC through regulating miR-124/NF-κB signaling pathway, suggesting an attractive therapy target for NPC patients. © 2017 Cheng and Guo.","LncRNA; MiR-124; Nasopharyngeal carcinoma; NEAT1; NF-κB pathway",Article,Scopus

This may be an important reason why immune checkpoint inhibitors are mainly effective in tumors with a high mutational burden. Reasons for clinically insufficient responses to neoantigens might be inefficient priming, inhibition, or deletion of the cognate T cells. Responses can be dramatically improved by cancer immunotherapy such as checkpoint inhibition, but often with temporary effects. By contrast, T cells from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors can cure diseases such as chronic myeloid leukemia. The therapeutic effect is mediated by donor T cells recognizing polymorphic peptides for which the donor and patient are disparate, presented on self-HLA. Donor T-cell repertoires are unbiased by the immunosuppressive environment of the tumor. A recent study demonstrated that T cells from healthy individuals are able to respond to neoantigens that are ignored by tumor-infiltrating T cells of melanoma patients. In this review, we discuss possible reasons why neoantigens escape host T cells and how these limitations may be overcome by utilization of donor-derived T-cell repertoires to facilitate rational design of neoantigen-targeted immunotherapy. © 2017 Karpanen and Olweus.","Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Donor; Donor lymphocyte infusion; Graft versus tumor effect; Immunotherapy; Minor histocompatibility antigen; Neoantigen; T cell",Short Survey,Scopus

Rationally designed DNA nanoparticles (DNPs) have emerged as facile delivery vehicles because their physicochemical properties can be precisely controlled. Nonetheless, few studies have used DNPs to deliver siRNAs in vivo, and none has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we constructed a number of DNPs of rectangular and tubular shapes with varied dimensions using the modular DNA brick method for the systemic delivery of siRNA that targets anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2. The siRNA delivered by the DNPs inhibited cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, which suppressed tumor growth in a xenograft model that specifically correlated with Bcl2 depletion. This study suggests that DNPs are effective tools for the systemic delivery of therapeutic siRNA and have great potential for further clinical translation. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The prognosis of IMPC compared with that of IDC remains controversial; we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the prognostic difference between IMPC and IDC. Methods: We searched the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases for relevant studies comparing overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), relapse-free survival (RFS), local-regional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) or distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) rates between IMPC and IDC. Fixed-effect and random-effect models were utilized based on the heterogeneity of the eligible studies. Heterogeneity was further evaluated by subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Results: Fourteen studies with 1888 IMPC patients were included in the meta-analysis. The summarized odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated to estimate the prognostic difference between IMPC and IDC. IMPC patients showed an unfavorable prognosis for RFS (OR; 2.04; 95% CI: 1.63-2.55) and LRRFS (OR: 2.82; 95% CI: 1.90-4.17) compared with IDC. However, no significant difference was observed in OS (OR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.78-1.10), DSS (OR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.95-1.40) and DMFS (OR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.67-1.35) between IMPC and IDC. No obvious statistical heterogeneity was detected, except for DSS. Funnel plots and Egger's tests did not reveal publication bias, except for RFS. Conclusions: This analysis showed that IMPC patients have a higher rate of loco-regional recurrence than IDC patients. However, OS, DSS and DMFS were not significantly different between IMPC and IDC.

The contribution of individual cell types in the tumor microenvironment to these contrasting effects remains poorly understood. We provide evidence that during intestinal tumorigenesis, myeloid cell-derived H2O2 triggers genome-wide DNA mutations in intestinal epithelial cells to stimulate invasive growth. Moreover, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in myeloid cells initiates tumor growth in various organs also in the absence of a carcinogen challenge in a paracrine manner. Our data identify an intricate crosstalk between myeloid cell-derived ROS molecules, oxidative DNA damage, and tumor necrosis factor α-mediated signaling to orchestrate a tumor-promoting microenvironment causing invasive cancer. Canli et al. show that excessive H2O2 produced by myeloid cells, independent of cytokines, transforms intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) by triggering genome-wide DNA mutations. H2O2 also induces IEC to secrete cytokines and chemokines, via a TNFα autocrine loop, to recruit myeloid cells for promotion of tumor invasion. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","cancer initiation; chronic inflammation; GPx4; myeloid cells; oxidative stress",Article,Scopus

Most advanced NSCLC patients with mild to moderate COPD are treated with chemotherapy; however, the feasibility for and prognosis after chemotherapy of these patients are not well understood. The aim of this study was to elucidate the impact of mild to moderate COPD on the feasibility for and prognosis after chemotherapy in NSCLC patients. Patients and methods: A retrospective review was performed on 268 NSCLC patients who received first-line chemotherapy from 2009 to 2014 in our institution. Finally, 85 evaluable patients were included in this study. The clinical characteristics, toxicity profile, objective response rate, and prognosis were analyzed and compared between patients with mild to moderate COPD and those without COPD (non-COPD). Results: Forty-three patients were classified as COPD (27 cases mild and 16 cases moderate) and 42 patients as non-COPD. The COPD group were older and had fewer never-smokers than the non-COPD group. The objective response rate did not differ between groups (p=0.14). There was no significant difference in overall survival between COPD and non-COPD groups (15.0 and 17.0 months, log-rank test p=0.57).

We identify ATG4B as a substrate of mammalian sterile20-like kinase (STK) 26/MST4. MST4 phosphorylates ATG4B at serine residue 383, which stimulates ATG4B activity and increases autophagic flux. Inhibition of MST4 or ATG4B activities using genetic approaches or an inhibitor of ATG4B suppresses autophagy and the tumorigenicity of glioblastoma (GBM) cells. Furthermore, radiation induces MST4 expression, ATG4B phosphorylation, and autophagy. Inhibiting ATG4B in combination with radiotherapy in treating mice with intracranial GBM xenograft markedly slows tumor growth and provides a significant survival benefit.

As a result, the need for more appropriate cellular models of human physiology and disease has renewed the interest in spheroid 3D culture as a pertinent model for drug screening. However, despite technological progress that has significantly simplified spheroid production and analysis, the seeming complexity of the 3D approach has delayed its adoption in many laboratories. The present report demonstrates that the use of a spheroid model may be straightforward and can provide information that is not directly available with a standard 2D approach. We describe a cost-efficient method that allows for the production of an array of uniform spheroids, their staining with vital dyes, real-time monitoring of drug effects, and an ATP-endpoint assay, all in the same 96-well U-bottom plate. To demonstrate the method performance, we analyzed the effect of the preclinical anticancer drug MLN4924 on spheroids formed by VCaP and LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The drug has different outcomes in these cell lines, varying from cell cycle arrest and protective dormancy to senescence and apoptosis. We demonstrate that by using high-content analysis of spheroid arrays, the effect of the drug can be described as a series of EC50 values that clearly dissect the cytostatic and cytotoxic drug actions. The method was further evaluated using four standard cancer chemotherapeutics with different mechanisms of action, and the effect of each drug is described as a unique multi-EC50 diagram. Once fully validated in a wider range of conditions, this method could be particularly valuable for phenotype-based drug discovery. © 2017 Mittler, Obeïd, Rulina, Haguet, Gidrol and Balakirev.","3D model; Drug discovery; HCS screening; MLN4924; Nedd8; Prostate cancer; Spheroids; Ubiquitin",Article,Scopus

The objective of the current study was to explore in-depth and to explain the decision-making process from the perspective of Mexican oncologists, parents, and affected adolescents and to identify the ethical principles that guide such decision-making. Methods: Purposive, qualitative design based on individual, fact-to-face, semi-structured, in-depth interviews. The participants were thirteen paediatric oncologists, 13 parents or primary carers, and six adolescents with incurable cancer. The participants were recruited from the paediatric oncology services of three national tertiary-care medical centres in Mexico City. Results: The oncologists stated that they broach the subject of palliative management when they have determined that curative treatment has failed. Respect for autonomy was understood as the assent of the parent/adolescent to what the oncologist determined to be in the best interest of the adolescent. The oncologists thought that the adolescent should be involved in the decision-making. They also identified the ability to count on a palliative care clinic or service as an urgent need. For the parents, it was essential that the oncologist be truly interested in their adolescent child. The parents did not consider it necessary to inform the child about impending death. The adolescents stated that the honesty of their oncologists was important; however, several of them opted for a passive role in the decision-making process. Conclusion: The findings of this study evidence that to achieve good medical practice in low-middle income countries, like Mexico, it is urgent to begin effective implementation of palliative care, together with appropriate training and continuing education in the ethics of clinical practice. © 2017 The Author(s).","Adolescents; Cancer; Decision-making; End-of-life; Mexico; Palliative care; Parents; Physicians",Article,Scopus

Its malignancy is due to rapid cell division along with high motility and invasiveness of cells into the brain tissue. Simple 2-dimensional laboratory assays (e.g., a scratch assay) commonly are used to measure the effects of various experimental perturbations, such as treatment with chemical inhibitors. Several mathematical models have been developed to aid the understanding of the motile behavior and proliferation of GBM cells. However, many are mathematically complicated, look at multiple interdependent phenomena, and/or use modeling software not freely available to the research community. These attributes make the adoption of models and simulations of even simple 2-dimensional cell behavior an uncommon practice by cancer cell biologists. Results: Herein, we developed an accurate, yet simple, rule-based modeling framework to describe the in vitro behavior of GBM cells that are stimulated by the L1CAM protein using freely available NetLogo software. In our model L1CAM is released by cells to act through two cell surface receptors and a point of signaling convergence to increase cell motility and proliferation. A simple graphical interface is provided so that changes can be made easily to several parameters controlling cell behavior, and behavior of the cells is viewed both pictorially and with dedicated graphs. We fully describe the hierarchical rule-based modeling framework, show simulation results under several settings, describe the accuracy compared to experimental data, and discuss the potential usefulness for predicting future experimental outcomes and for use as a teaching tool for cell biology students. Conclusions: It is concluded that this simple modeling framework and its simulations accurately reflect much of the GBM cell motility behavior observed experimentally in vitro in the laboratory. Our framework can be modified easily to suit the needs of investigators interested in other similar intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli that influence cancer or other cell behavior. This modeling framework of a commonly used experimental motility assay (scratch assay) should be useful to both researchers of cell motility and students in a cell biology teaching laboratory. © 2017 The Author(s).","Biological modeling framework; Cancer; Cell culture; Cell motility; Glioblastoma; L1CAM; NetLogo2-D; Rule-based model; Scratch assay",Article,Scopus

In particular, we emphasized pseudogenes potentially relevant to this cancer. While cataloguing the profiles based on the known biotypes, all the employed RNA-Seq methods generated just a small consensus of significant biotypes. We thus designed an approach to reconcile the profiles from all methods following a simple strategy: we selected genes that were confirmed as differentially expressed by the ensemble predictions obtained in a regression model. The main advantages of this approach are: 1) Selection of a high-confidence gene set identifying relevant pathways; 2) Use of a regression model whose covariates embed all method-driven outcomes to predict an averaged profile; 3) Method-specific assessment of prediction power and significance. Furthermore, the approach can be generalized to any biological system for which noisy RNA-Seq profiles are computed. As our analyses concerned bio-annotations of both high-quality protein coding genes and ncRNAs, we considered the associations between pseudogenes and parental genes (targets). Among the candidate targets that were validated, we identified PINK1, which is studied in patients with Parkinson and cancer (especially melanoma).",,Article,Scopus

The molecular mechanisms through which established risk factors, such as chronic pancreatitis, acinar cell damage, and/or defective autophagy increase the likelihood of PDAC development are poorly understood. We show that accumulation of the autophagy substrate p62/SQSTM1 in stressed KrasG12D acinar cells is associated with PDAC development and maintenance of malignancy in human cells and mice. p62 accumulation promotes neoplastic progression by controlling the NRF2-mediated induction of MDM2, which acts through p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms to abrogate checkpoints that prevent conversion of differentiated acinar cells to proliferative ductal progenitors. MDM2 targeting may be useful for preventing PDAC development in high-risk individuals. Todoric et al. demonstrate that pancreatitis-induced accumulation of the autophagy substrate p62/SQSTM1 in the context of oncogenic KRAS promotes progression to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This p62 function relies on NRF2-driven induction of MDM2 and both p53 dependent and independent activity of MDM2. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","acinar cell reprogramming; IKKα; impaired autophagy; MDM2; NRF2; p62; pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma",Article,Scopus

Here, we show that loss of VHL alone results in DNA replication stress and damage accumulation, effects that constrain cellular growth and transformation. By contrast, concomitant loss of the chromatin remodelling factor PBRM1 (mutated in 40% of ccRCC) rescues VHL-induced replication stress, maintaining cellular fitness and allowing proliferation. In line with these data we demonstrate that combined deletion of Vhl and Pbrm1 in the mouse kidney is sufficient for the development of fully-penetrant, multifocal carcinomas, closely mimicking human ccRCC. Our results illustrate how VHL and PBRM1 co-operate to drive renal transformation and uncover replication stress as an underlying vulnerability of all VHL mutated renal cancers that could be therapeutically exploited.",,Article,Scopus

A mechanism of resistance to PEM is associated with elevated activities of several enzymes involved in nucleic acid metabolism. Methods: We established two kinds of PEM-resistant mesothelioma cells which did not show any increase of the relevant enzyme activities. We screened genes enhanced in the PEM-resistant cells with a microarray analysis and confirmed the expression levels with Western blot analysis. A possible involvement of the candidates in the PEM-resistance was examined with a WST assay after knocking down the expression with si-RNA. We also analyzed a mechanism of the up-regulated expression with agents influencing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and p53. Results: We found that expression of cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP) was elevated in the PEM-resistant cells with a microarray and Western blot analysis. Down-regulation of CARP expression with si-RNA did not however influence the PEM resistance. Parent and PEM-resistant cells treated with PEM increased expression of CARP, AMPK, p53 and histone H2AX. The CARP up-regulation was however irrelevant to the p53 genotypes and not induced by an AMPK activator. Augmented p53 levels with nutlin-3a, an inhibitor for p53 degradation, and DNA damages were not always associated with the enhanced CARP expression. Conclusions: These data collectively suggest that up-regulated CARP expression is a potential marker for development of PEM-resistance in mesothelioma and that the PEM-mediated enhanced expression is not directly linked with immediate cellular responses to PEM. © 2017 The Author(s).","Biomarker; Cardiac ankyrin repeat protein; Mesothelioma; PEM resistance",Article,Scopus

A biopsy demonstrated the presence of a NET and endoscopic submucosal dissection was undertaken. Histologic examination revealed that a well differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma was present in addition to the NET. Furthermore, histological transition between the two tumors was evident. Accordingly, this case was considered to be a composite tumor comprising NET and adenocarcinoma.

Although two-photon excitation strategies have been developed, the two-photon absorption cross sections of clinically used photosensitizers are generally low (below 300 GM). Besides, photosensitizers with high cross section values are often non-water-soluble. In this research work, a whole family of photosensitizer-polymer conjugates was synthesized via the covalent binding of a photosensitizer with a relatively high cross section along a biocompatible copolymer chain. The resulting photosensitizer-polymer conjugates were water-soluble and could be imaged in cellulo by two-photon microscopy thanks to their high two-photon absorption cross sections (up to 2600 GM in water, in the NIR range). In order to explore the structure/photodynamic activity relationship of such macromolecular photosensitizers, the influence of the polymer size, photosensitizer density, and presence of charges along the polymer backbone was investigated (neutral, anionic, cationic, and zwitterionic conjugates were compared). The macromolecular photosensitizers were not cytotoxic in the absence of light irradiation. Their kinetics of cellular uptake in the B16-F10 melanoma cell line were followed by flow cytometry over 24 h. The efficiency of cell death upon photoactivation was found to be highly correlated to the cellular uptake in turn correlated to the global charge of the macromolecular photosensitizer which appeared as the determining structural parameter. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,Article,Scopus

Besides its traditional application in anemia therapy, it offers an effective treatment in the cancer patients, especially those who receive chemotherapy. Several reports indicated that it could promote the tumor cell proliferation through its specific receptor (EPOR). Unfortunately, the role of EPO/EPOR in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progressing is still uncertain. Methods: Protein in tumor tissue from HCC patients or H22 tumor-bearing mice was detected with immunohistochemistry. Cells were cultured under 1% oxygen to establish hypoxia. RT-PCR and western blotting were used to measure mRNA and protein of EPO/EPOR, respectively. MTT, flow cytometry and PCNA staining were used to detect cell proliferation. Immunofluorescence staining was applied to study the expression and location of cellular EPOR. The EPOR binding studies were performed with 125I-EPO radiolabeling assay. Results: EPO and EPOR protein were up-regulated in HCC tissue of patients and H22-bearing mice. These were positively correlated with hypoxia-inducible factor -1 α and ki-67. Hypoxia up-regulated the expression of EPO and EPOR in HepG2 cells. It also induced the proliferation and increased the percentage of divided cells after 24, 48 and 72 h treatment. These were inhibited in cells pre-treated with 0.5 μg/mL soluble-EPOR. Immunofluorescence staining presented that EPOR was obviously translocated from nucleus to cytoplasm and membrane under hypoxia. EPOR binding activity was also increased after exposure to hypoxia. Recombinant human erythropoietin obviously elevated cell proliferation rate and the percentage of divided under hypoxia but not normoxia, which were also inhibited by soluble-EPOR. Conclusions: Our result indicated for the first time that EPO promoted the proliferation of HCC cells through hypoxia induced translocation of it specific receptor.

Yet, a second form of GnRH (GnRH2) and its receptor (GnRHR2) also exist in mammals. GnRH2 has been completely conserved throughout 500 million years of evolution, signifying high selection pressure and a critical biological role. However, the GnRH2 gene is absent (e.g., rat) or inactivated (e.g., cow and sheep) in some species but retained in others (e.g., human, horse, and pig). Likewise, many species (e.g., human, chimpanzee, cow, and sheep) retain the GnRHR2 gene but lack the appropriate coding sequence to produce a full-length protein due to gene coding errors; although production of GnRHR2 in humans remains controversial. Certain mammals lack the GnRHR2 gene (e.g., mouse) or most exons entirely (e.g., rat). In contrast, old world monkeys, musk shrews, and pigs maintain the coding sequence required to produce a functional GnRHR2. Like GnRHR1, GnRHR2 is a 7-transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptor that interacts with Gaq/11 to mediate cell signaling. However, GnRHR2 retains a cytoplasmic tail and is only 40% homologous to GnRHR1. A role for GnRH2 and its receptor in mammals has been elusive, likely because common laboratory models lack both the ligand and receptor. Uniquely, both GnRH2 and GnRHR2 are ubiquitously expressed; transcript levels are abundant in peripheral tissues and scarcely found in regions of the brain associated with gonadotropin secretion, suggesting a divergent role from GnRH1/GnRHR1. Indeed, GnRH2 and its receptor are not physiological modulators of gonadotropin secretion in mammals. Instead, GnRH2 and GnRHR2 coordinate the interaction between nutritional status and sexual behavior in the female brain. Within peripheral tissues, GnRH2 and its receptor are novel regulators of reproductive organs. GnRH2 and GnRHR2 directly stimulate steroidogenesis within the porcine testis. In the female, GnRH2 and its receptor may help mediate placental function, implantation, and ovarian steroidogenesis. Furthermore, both the GnRH2 and GnRHR2 genes are expressed in human reproductive tumors and represent emerging targets for cancer treatment. Thus, GnRH2 and GnRHR2 have diverse functions in mammals which remain largely unexplored. © 2017 Desaulniers, Cederberg, Lents and White.","Autocrine/paracrine mechanisms; Cancer; G protein-coupled receptor; G protein-coupled receptor signal transduction; GnRH2; GnRH2 receptor; Reproductive function; Testis",Review,Scopus

These dangers urgently compel the development of agents for ameliorating radiation-induced injuries. Biologic pathways mediated by myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), the common adaptor for toll-like receptor (TLR) and Interleukin-1 receptor signaling, are critical for radioprotection. Treating with agonists prior to radiation enhances survival by activating TLR signaling, whereas radiomitigating TLR-activating therapeutics given after exposure are less defined. We examine the radiomitigation capability of TLR agonists and identify one that is superior for its efficacy and reduced toxic consequences compared to other tested agonists. We demonstrate that the synthetic TLR2/6 ligand Fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide (FSL-1) substantially prolongs survival in both male and female mice when administered 24 hours after radiation and shows MyD88-dependent function. FSL-1 treatment results in accelerated hematopoiesis in bone marrow, spleen and periphery, and augments systemic levels of hematopoiesis-stimulating factors. The ability of FSL-1 to stimulate hematopoiesis is critical, as hematopoietic dysfunction results from a range of ionizing radiation doses.

Despite this, it has been unclear whether the GSK-3α/β pathway accounts for CD28 costimulation of CD8 + CTL function.

In this retrospective observational study, we identified how often optimal techniques were used and whether surgeons' training impacted implementation. Methods: We used the ACOG guidelines highlighting various aspects of the procedure to determine which elements were consistent with best practices to maximize surgical prophylaxis. All cases of RRBSO from 2006 to 2010 were identified. We abstracted data from the operative and pathology reports to review the techniques employed. Fisher's exact test and chi-square were utilized to compare differences between groups (InStat, La Jolla, CA). Results: Among 263 RRBSOs, 22 were performed by general gynecologists and 241 by gynecologic oncologists. Gynecologic oncologists were more likely to perform pelvic washings-217/241 vs. 10/22 (p < .0001). They were more likely to include a description of the upper abdomen-220/241 vs. 12/22 (p < .0001). Oncologists were more likely to utilize a retroperitoneal approach to skeletonize the infundibulopelvic ligaments-157/241 vs. 3/22 (p < .0001).

The use of a retroperitoneal approach among gynecologic oncologists increased over the study period (chi-square for trend, p < .0001).

We find that concomitant p53 activation and Bcl-2 inhibition overcome apoptosis resistance and markedly prolong survival in three mouse models of resistant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Mechanistically, p53 activation negatively regulates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and activates GSK3 to modulate Mcl-1 phosphorylation and promote its degradation, thus overcoming AML resistance to Bcl-2 inhibition. Moreover, Bcl-2 inhibition reciprocally overcomes apoptosis resistance to p53 activation by switching cellular response from G1 arrest to apoptosis. The efficacy, together with the mechanistic findings, reveals the potential of simultaneously targeting these two apoptosis regulators and provides a rational basis for clinical testing of this therapeutic approach. Pan et al. show that p53 activation promotes Mcl-1 degradation, and Bcl-2 inhibition shifts the p53 activation response from G1 arrest to apoptosis. Combining p53 activation and Bcl-2 inhibition overcomes resistance to either alone and provides better therapeutic efficacy in mouse models of acute myeloid leukemia. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","ABT-199; apoptosis resistance; Bcl-2; G1 arrest; leukemia; MAPK; Mcl-1; MDM2; p53; RG7388",Article,Scopus

The introduction of carboxyl groups in methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-(poly(γ-ethyl-l-glutamate-co-l-glutamic acid) (mPEG-b-P(ELG-co-LG)) not only led to adjustable mechanical properties of the hydrogel but also significantly reduced the burst release of the drug through the complexation between the carboxyl groups of polypeptide and CDDP. Furthermore, both the good biocompatibility and the biodegradable properties of mPEG-b-P(ELG-co-LG) hydrogel were observed in vivo. Interestingly, the CDDP-complexed mPEG-b-P(ELG-co-LG) hydrogel exhibited significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy in vivo compared to the mPEG-b-PELG hydrogel loaded with CDDP without complexation, although a lower cytotoxicity and IC50 of the CDDP-complexed hydrogel was observed in vitro.

Medicinal plant extracts represent a perfect example of such stratagem. However, minimal studies have been done till date that portray the effect of extraction techniques on the phyto-constituent profile of plant extracts and its impact on anticancer activity. In the present study, we have evaluated the anticancer potential of methanolic extracts of Berberis aristata root and Azadirachta indica seeds prepared by various extraction techniques in human osteosarcoma (HOS) cells. Soxhlation extract of B. aristata (BAM-SX) and sonication extract of A. indica (AIM-SO) were most effective in inducing apoptosis in parental drug sensitive, as well as resistant cell type developed by repeated drug exposure. Generation of reactive oxygen species and cell cycle arrest preceded caspase-mediated apoptosis in HOS cells. Interestingly, inhibition of autophagy enhanced cell death suggesting the cytoprotective role of autophagy. Combination studies of different methanolic extracts of BAM and AIM were performed, among which, the combination of BAM-SO and AIM-SO (BAAISO) was found to show synergism (IC 50 10.27 μg/ml) followed by combination of BAM-MC and AIM-MC (BAAIMC) with respect to other combinations in the ratio of 1:1. BAAISO also showed synergism when it was added to cisplatin-resistant HOS cells (HCR). Chromatographic profiling of BAM-SX and AIM-SO by high performance thin layer chromatography resulted in identification of berberine (R f 0.55), palmitine (R f 0.50) in BAM-SX and azadirachtin A (R f 0.36), azadirachtin B (R f 0.56), nimbin (R f 0.80), and nimbolide (R f 0.43) in AIM-SO. The cytotoxic sensitivity obtained can be attributed to the above compounds. Our results highlight the importance of extraction technique and subsequent mechanism of action of multi-constituential B. aristata and A. indica against both sensitive and drug refractory HOS cells. © 2017 Sengupta, Raman, Chowdhury, Lohitesh, Saini, Mukherjee and Paul.","Autophagy, caspase-mediated apoptosis; Extraction techniques; HCR cell lines; High performance thin layer chromatography; Human osteosarcoma cell lines; Reactive oxygen species; Synergism",Article,Scopus

Meta-analyses were conducted for measures of lipid profile, inflammation, oxidative stress, and blood pressure. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool and quality of the body of evidence was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Twelve studies were included for review. Polyphenol-rich interventions included soy, cocoa, pomegranate, grape, and turmeric. Polyphenol-rich interventions significantly improved diastolic blood pressure (Mean Difference (MD) -5.62 mmHg (95% Confidence Interval (CI) -8.47, -2.78); I2 = 2%; p = 0.0001), triglyceride levels (MD -26.52 mg/dL (95% CI -47.22, -5.83); I2 = 57%; p = 0.01), and myeloperoxidase (MD -90.10 (95% CI -135.84, -44.36); I2 = 0%; p = 0.0001). Included studies generally had low or unclear risks of bias. The results of this review provide preliminary support for the use of polyphenol-rich interventions for improving cardiovascular risk markers in haemodialysis patients.

Virtual bronchoscopic navigation (VBN) is a method in which virtual images of the bronchial route to the lesion are produced based on CT images obtained before VBN, and the bronchoscope is guided using these virtual images, improving the diagnostic yield of peripheral pulmonary lesions. VBN has the possibility of eliminating the need for X-ray fluoroscopy in the bronchoscopic diagnosis of peripheral lesions. To determine whether VBN can be a substitute for X-ray fluoroscopy, a randomized multicenter trial (non-inferiority trial) was performed in VBN and X-ray fluoroscopy (XRF) -assisted groups. Methods: The non-inferiority margin in the VBN-assisted group compared with the XRF-assisted group was set at 15%. The subjects consisted of 140 patients with peripheral pulmonary lesions with a mean diameter > 3 cm. In the VBN-assisted group, the bronchoscope was guided to the lesion using a VBN system without X-ray fluoroscopy. In the XRF-assisted group, the same bronchoscope was guided to the lesion under X-ray fluoroscopy. Subsequently, in both groups, the lesion was visualized using endobronchial ultrasonography with a guide sheath (EBUS/GS), and biopsy was performed. In this serial procedure, X-ray fluoroscopy was not used in the VBNA group. Results: The subjects of analysis consisted of 129 patients. The diagnostic yield was 76.9% (50/65) in the VBN-assisted group and 85.9% (55/64) in the XRF-assisted group. The difference in the diagnostic yield between the two groups was -9.0% (95% confidence interval: -22.3% ~ 4.3%). The non-inferiority of the VBN-assisted group could not be confirmed. The rate of visualizing lesions by EBUS was 95.4% (62/65) in the VBN-assisted group and 96.9% (62/64) in the XRF-assisted group, being high in both groups. Conclusions: On EBUS/GS, a bronchoscope and biopsy instruments may be guided to the lesions using VBN without X-ray fluoroscopy, but X-ray fluoroscopy is necessary to improve the accuracy of sample collection from lesions. During transbronchial biopsy for peripheral pulmonary lesions, VBN cannot be a substitute for X-ray fluoroscopy.

This study investigated the effects of SALL2 on human ovarian carcinoma (OC) A2780 cells and the probable mechanism. Methods: Expression of SALL2 in human OC cell lines were detected by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. A2780 cells were transfected with small-interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) to silence SALL2. SALL2 expression was detected by RT-PCR, Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assay. Cell proliferation was measured by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry (FCM). Apoptosis was measured by FCM. Cell migration was detected by real-time cell analysis. Cell invasion was detected by transwell assay. mRNA expression of p21 was detected by quantitative real-time PCR. Western blot analysis was used to determine the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2, MMP9, protein kinase B (PKB, also called Akt), and phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt). Results: SALL2 was expressed in six OC cell lines, and the expression was the highest in A2780 cells. Compared with that in the Scramble group, SALL2 expression in A2780 was downregulated after transfection with siRNA-2 and siRNA-3 for 48 h. Compared with that in the Scramble group, proliferation of A2780 cells in the siRNA-2 group increased after transfection for 24, 48 and 72 h. In the siRNA-2 group, the proportion of A2780 cells decreased in the G0/G1 phase, and cell apoptosis decreased after transfection for 48 h. Compared with that in the Scramble group, the cell migration and invasion abilities of A2780 cells increased. Compared with that in the Scramble group, p21 mRNA expression in A2780 cells decreased after transfection with siRNA2. When SALL2 was silenced, the expression of MMP2/9 and p-Akt in A2780 cells increased. Furthermore, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 could effectively reversed SALL2 siRNA-induced phosphorylation of Akt, migration and invasion of A2780 cells. Conclusion: Transient silencing of SALL2 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and inhibits apoptosis of A2780 cells. In SALL2 siRNA-silenced cells, p21 expression was decreased. SALL2 knockdown by siRNA induces the migration and invasion of A2780 cells; this phenomenon is possibly associated with the increased expression of MMP2/9 and the activation of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. © 2017 The Author(s).","MMP2/9; Ovarian carcinoma; P21; PI3K/Akt; RNA interference; SALL2",Article,Scopus

Patients and Methods By using the National Cancer Data Base, we estimated absolute change (APC) and relative change in percent uninsured among patients with newly diagnosed cancer age 18 to 64 years between 2011 to the third quarter of 2013 (pre-ACA implementation) and the second to fourth quarter of 2014 (post-ACA) in Medicaid expansion and nonexpansion states by family income level. We also examined demographics-adjusted difference in differences in APC between Medicaid expansion and nonexpansion states. We similarly examined changes in insurance and early-stage diagnosis for the 15 leading cancers in men and women (top 17 cancers total). Results Between the pre-ACA and post-ACA periods, percent uninsured among patients with newly diagnosed cancer decreased in all income categories in both Medicaid expansion and nonexpansion states. However, the decrease was largest in low-income patients who resided in expansion states (9.6% to 3.6%; APC, -6.0%; 95% CI, -6.5% to -5.5%) versus their counterparts who resided in nonexpansion states (14.7% to 13.3%; APC, -1.4%; 95% CI, -2.0% to -0.7%), with an adjusted difference in differences of -3.3 (95% CI, -4.0 to -2.5). By cancer type, the largest decrease in percent uninsured occurred in patients with smoking- or infection-related cancers. A small but statistically significant shift was found toward early-stage diagnosis for colorectal, lung, female breast, and pancreatic cancer and melanoma in patients who resided in expansion states. Conclusion Percent uninsured among nonelderly patients with newly diagnosed cancer declined substantially after the ACA, especially among low-income people who resided in Medicaid expansion states. A trend toward early-stage diagnosis for select cancers in expansion states also was found.

Serious non-lung toxicities were observed mostly in patients with central tumors, but we experienced a case of fatal gastric perforation after a second stereotactic body radiotherapy in a patient with a peripheral lung tumor. Case presentation: An 83-year-old Asian man was diagnosed with T2N0M0 lung cancer in the form of squamous cell carcinoma in the lower lobe of his left lung. He was treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy of 40 Gy in 4 fractions and the tumor decreased in size in partial response. The local tumor recurred 8 months after the first stereotactic body radiotherapy, and he was re-irradiated with a second stereotactic body radiotherapy of 50 Gy in 4 fractions. A Sengstaken-Blakemore tube was inserted below his diaphragm by laparoscopic surgery before the second stereotactic body radiotherapy in order to reduce the stomach dose by keeping his stomach apart from the tumor. Two months after the second stereotactic body radiotherapy, he developed fatal gastric perforation and gastropleural fistula penetrating his diaphragm. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about a gastric perforation after stereotactic body radiotherapy for lung tumors and it warns of serious complication of stereotactic body radiotherapy in not only centrally located but also peripherally located tumors like in this case. © 2017 The Author(s).","Gastric perforation; Lung cancer; Re-irradiation; Stereotactic body radiotherapy",Article,Scopus

Formulating PTX with Cremophor EL and ethanol (Taxol®) realized its clinical potential, but the formulation falls short of expectations due to side effects such as peripheral neuropathy, hypotension, and hypersensitivity. Abraxane® the albumin bound PTX, represents a superior replacement of Taxol® that mitigates the side effects associated with Cremophor EL. While Abraxane® is now considered a gold standard in chemotherapy, its 21% response rate leaves much room for further improvement. The quest for safer and more effective cancer treatments has led to the development of a plethora of innovative PTX formulations, many of which are currently undergoing clinical trials. In this context, we review recent development of PTX drug delivery systems and analyze the design principles underpinning each delivery strategy.

Currently, TNBC is the only type of breast cancer for which there are no approved targeted therapies and maximum tolerated dose chemotherapy with taxanes and anthracycline-containing regimens is still the standard of care in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. In the last years, metronomic chemotherapy (MC) is being explored as an alternative to improve outcomes in TNBC. In the neoadjuvant setting, purely metronomic and hybrid approaches have been developed with the objective of increasing complete pathologic response (PCR) and prolonging disease free survival. These regimens proved to be very effective achieving PCR rates between 47%-60%, but at the cost of great toxicity. In the adjuvant setting, MC is used to intensify adjuvant chemotherapy and, more promisingly, as maintenance therapy for high-risk patients, especially those with no PCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Considering the dismal prognosis of TNBC, any strategy that potentially improves outcomes, specially being the oral agents broadly available and inexpensive, should be considered and certainly warrants further exploration. Finally, the benefit of MC needs to be validated in properly designed clinical trials were the selection of the population is the key. © The Author(s) 2017.","Adjuvant; Maintenance; Metronomic chemotherapy; Neoadjuvant; Triple negative breast cancer",Review,Scopus

Methods Eighty cases of recurrent thyroid cancer patients for reoperation were enrolled and divided into the observation group and the control group by the method of random number table, with 40 cases in each group. The observation group used intraoperative electromyography monitor to locate the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The control group received routine surgery, which relied on the surgical experience and naked-eye observation of the surgeons to protect the recurrent laryngeal nerve. All cases were followed up for 6 to 8 months in the outpatient department after surgery. The length of surgical time, the duration of postoperative drainage, the length of postoperative hospital stay, the intraoperative time needed to locate the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and the incidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury were compared between the two groups. Moreover, postoperative hoarseness, dyspnea and dysphagia were also analyzed. Results The operation time, the postoperative drainage time and the length of postoperative hospital stay were all shorter in the observation group than those in the control group (all P<0.05). Besides, the incidence of postoperative hoarseness, dyspnea and dysphagia was also reduced in the observation group as compared with the control group (all P<0.05).

In this study, we prepared matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9)-responsive polymeric conjugates consisting of PEGylated hyaluronic acid (HA) as the targeting moiety and ovalbumin (OVA) as the model foreign antigen. The MMP9-cleavable linker was introduced between PEG and the HA backbone to facilitate the detachment of the PEG corona from the conjugate at the tumor site. From the in vitro cellular uptake study, it was revealed that the conjugate was effectively taken up by the CD44-expressing TC-1 cancer cells in the presence of MMP9 via receptor-mediated endocytosis. When the conjugate was systemically administered into the tumor-bearing mice with endogenous OVA-specific CTLs, the tumor growth was markedly inhibited, which was attributed to the significant antigen presentation on the tumor cells. Overall, the MMP9-responsive conjugates bearing foreign antigens might have the potential as an alternative to CTL-based cancer immunotherapeutics. © 2017","Antigen delivery; Cancer immunotherapy; Foreignization; Hyaluronic acid; Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9); PEGylation",Article,Scopus

The IDI averages risks across events and non-events and is therefore susceptible to Simpson's paradox. In some settings, adding a predictive covariate to a well calibrated model results in an overall negative (positive) IDI. However, if stratified by that same covariate, the strata-specific IDIs are positive (negative). Meanwhile, the calibration (observed to expected ratio and Hosmer–Lemeshow Goodness of Fit Test), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and Brier score improve overall and by stratum. We ran extensive simulations to investigate the impact of an imbalanced covariate upon metrics (IDI, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, Brier score, and R2), provide an analytic explanation for the paradox in the IDI, and use an investigative metric, a Weighted IDI, to better understand the paradox. In simulations, all instances of the paradox occurred under stratum-specific mis-calibration, yet there were mis-calibrated settings in which the paradox did not occur. The paradox is illustrated on Cancer Genomics Network data by calculating predictions based on two versions of BRCAPRO, a Mendelian risk prediction model for breast and ovarian cancer. In both simulations and the Cancer Genomics Network data, overall model calibration did not guarantee stratum-level calibration. We conclude that the IDI should only assess model performance among a clinically relevant subset when stratum-level calibration is strictly met and recommend calculating additional metrics to confirm the direction and conclusions of the IDI.

However, treatment success is often limited due to systemic toxicity. To improve therapeutic efficacy, polymer drug conjugates carrying synergistic pairs of chemotherapy drugs can be used to reduce drug administration dose. Here, we systematically evaluated the effect of temporal scheduling of doxorubicin (DOX) and gemcitabine (GEM) on drug synergy. Hyaluronic acid (HA) drug conjugates with distinct linkers conjugating both DOX and GEM were synthesized to control relative release kinetics of each drug. We show that polymer conjugates that release GEM faster than DOX are more effective at killing triple negative breast cancer cells in vitro. We further show that the optimal dual drug conjugate more effectively inhibits the growth of an aggressive, orthotopic 4T1 tumor model in vivo than free DOX and GEM and the single drug HA conjugates. The dual drug HA conjugate can inhibit 4T1 tumor growth in vivo during treatment through both intravenous and non-local subcutaneous injections. These results emphasize the importance of understanding the effect release rates have on the efficacy of synergistic drug carriers and motivate the use of HA as a delivery platform for multiple cancer types. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Breast cancer; Doxorubcin; Drug combinations; Gemcitabine; Polymer drug conjugates; Synergy",Article,Scopus

Generalized estimating equations were applied to ascertain the association among arm volume changes, clinical factors, and risk exposures. Results: The cohort comprised 327 patients and 654 at-risk arms, with a median postoperative follow-up that ranged from 6.1 to 68.2 months. Of the 654 arms, 83 developed lymphedema, defined as a WAC $ 10% relative to baseline. On multivariable analysis, none of the lifestyle risk factors examined through the risk assessment survey were significantly associated with increased WAC. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that having a body mass index &gt; 25 kg/m 2 at the time of breast cancer diagnosis (P =.0404), having undergone axillary lymph node dissection (P =.0464), and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy (P =.0161) were significantly associated with increased arm volume. Conclusion: Blood pressure readings, blood draws, injections, and number or duration of flights were not significantly associated with increases in arm volume in this cohort. These findings may help to guide patient education about lymphedema risk reduction strategies for those who undergo bilateral breast cancer surgery. © 2017 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,Article,Scopus

This focused update addressed the new data on intervals between dosing and the role of BMAs in control of bone pain. Methods: A joint ASCO-CCO Update Committee conducted targeted systematic literature reviews to identify relevant studies. Results: The Update Committee reviewed three phase III noninferiority trials of dosing intervals, one systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of de-escalation of BMAs, and two randomized trials of BMAs in control of pain secondary to bone metastases. Recommendations: Patients with breast cancer who have evidence of bone metastases should be treated with BMAs. Options include denosumab, 120 mg subcutaneously, every 4 weeks; pamidronate, 90 mg intravenously, every 3 to 4 weeks; or zoledronic acid, 4 mg intravenously every 12 weeks or every 3 to 4 weeks. The analgesic effects of BMAs are modest, and they should not be used alone for bone pain. The Update Committee recommends that the current standard of care for supportive care and pain management-analgesia, adjunct therapies, radiotherapy, surgery, systemic anticancer therapy, and referral to supportive care and pain management-be applied. Evidence is insufficient to support the use of one BMA over another. © 2017 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,Article,Scopus

Methods Sixty-seven AGC patients who showed no disease progression after 6 cycles of first-line SOX regimen chemotherapy were enrolled. According to patients' decision,29 cases participated in the control group (optimal supportive care) and 38 cases participated in the maintenance group (S-1 40-60 mg,twice daily for 21 d; 35 d a cycle). For both groups,the short-term efficacy was assessed by RECIST 1.1 for every 2 cycles,and chemotherapy toxicity was evaluated by NCI-CTCAE 4.0.If there was no obvious deterioration of clinical symptoms,the patients in the control group was evaluated every 2 months,and their survival status were determined by phone interview. Results The median time to progression (TTP) was 8.2 months for the control group and 9.8 months for the maintenance group (P=0.026). The median overall survival time (OS) was 14.6 months and17.4 months for the two groups respectively (P=0.019). The most frequent treatment-related adverse events were grade Ⅰ-Ⅱ neutropenia,anemia,chromatosis,nausea,anorexia and fatigue in the maintenance group.

Methods: Four hundred and fifty patients with colorectal cancer who were pathologically confirmed by surgery and underwent preoperative CT examinationinthe first hospital of Jilin university from January 2016 to July 2016 were included retrospectively (Stage ≤T2, T3, and T4 each has 150 cases). According to the ratio of 2:1, the patients were divided into training set (300 cases) and test set (150 cases, stage ≤T2, T3, and T4 each has 50 cases) by computer random software. Each of 450 patients had one lesion. All the patients underwent preoperative abdominal and pelvic contrast-enhanced CT scan. The clinical, imaging and pathological data [gender, age, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) expression, intestinal wall deformation, maximum diameter of tumorand thickness of intestinal wall, location, enhancement homogeneity and enhancement rate] of these patients were collected. The correlation between the collected factors and pathological T staging was analyzed by Spearman correlation analysis. The preoperative staging model of colorectal cancer was established by RF algorithm in the training set. Two kinds of methods (model and traditional method) were used to diagnose T stage of the patients in the test set. The accuracy of the two methods was calculated by postoperative pathological staging as the gold standard. The consistency test was used to evaluate the consistency of the RF model results with the pathological results. Results: T-staging was positively correlated with CEA, CA19-9, intestinal wall deformation, tumor size and thickness of intestinal wall (r= 0.449, 0.291, 0.624, 0.573, 0.386; P<0.05). Age, location, enhancement homogeneity and enhancement rate were slightly negatively correlated with T-staging (r=-0.115,-0.245,-0.120 and-0.339;P<0.05).

The results of a recent large randomized trial (Cancer and Leukemia Group B/Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology [CALGB/Alliance 70604]) showed that zoledronic acid (ZA) every 3 months was noninferior to monthly ZA in reducing the risks of SREs. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness (CE) of monthly ZA, ZA every 3 months, and monthly denosumab in women with breast cancer and skeletal metastases. Methods: Using a Markov model, costs per SRE avoided were calculated for the three treatments. Sensitivity analyses were performed where denosumab SRE probabilities were assumedto be 50%, 75%, and 90% lower than the ZA SRE probabilities. Quality-adjusted life-years were also calculated. The analysis was from the US payer perspective. Results: The mean costs of the denosumab treatment strategy are nine-fold higher than generic ZA every 3 months. Quality-adjusted life-years were virtually identical in all the three treatment arms; hence, the optimal treatment would be ZA every 3 months because it was the least costly treatment. The sensitivity analyses showed that relative to ZA every 3 months, the incremental costs per mean SRE avoided for denosumab ranged from $162,918 to $347,655. Conclusion: ZA every 3 months was more CE in reducing the risks of SRE than monthly denosumab. This analysis was one of the first to incorporate the costs of generic ZA and one of the first independent CE analyses not sponsored by either Novartis or Amgen, the makers of ZA and denosumab, respectively.

All contemporary systemic anti-cancer agents are dependent upon passive transvascular mechanisms for their delivery into solid tumors. The therapeutic efficacies of our current drug arsenal could be significantly improved with an active delivery strategy. Here, we discuss how drug delivery and therapeutic efficacy are greatly hindered by barriers presented by the vascular endothelial cell layer and by the aberrant nature of tumor blood vessels in general. We describe mechanisms by which molecules cross endothelial cell (EC) barriers in normal tissues and in solid tumors, including paracellular and transcellular pathways that enable passive or active transport. We also discuss specific obstacles to drug delivery that make solid tumors difficult to treat, as well strategies to overcome them and enhance drug penetration. Finally, we describe the caveolae pumping system, a promising active transport alternative to passive drug delivery across the endothelial cell barrier.

Results Of the 3 356 patients who met study criteria,1 773 (52.8%) cases underwent lobectomy,1 281 (38.2%) cases underwent wedge resection,and 302 (9.0%) cases underwent segmentectomy.Related risk factors include age,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,previous cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack,functional status,smoking history in the past 6 months,and surgical approaches (minimally invasive or open surgery).For patients with risk scores higher than 5,the perioperative mortality rate in the lobectomy group (3.1%) was higher than that of the segmentectomy group (1.6%) or pulmonary wedge resection group (0.5%,P<0.01). Conclusions Among patients with a risk score of 5 or less,lobectomy confers no additional perioperative risk over sublobar resection.However,for patients with higher risk scores,their perioperative mortality of pulmonary lobectomy was significantly higher than that of sublobar resection.The risk assessment model established in this study can predict the perioperative mortality caused by different surgical approaches,which guide surgeons to select the most appropriate surgical method. © 2017, The Second Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University..

All patients received NCRT before surgery, and underwent T 2 WI and DWI before and after NCRT. These patients were chronologically divided in the primary cohort (300 patients) and independent validation cohort (107 patients). The predicting model was trained and validated using postoperative pathological findings as truth values. By using radiomics method, we extracted the features of the tumor and the largest LN before and after neoadjuvant therapy, combined different features of the tumor and/or the largest LN before and/or after neoadjuvant therapy, and constructed 4 different prediction models, compared the performance of four predicting models. The optimal model with the highest accuracy was validated in the independent cohort. Decision curve analysis was conducted to determine the clinical usefulness of the radiomics nomograms by quantifying the net benefits at different threshold probabilities in the validation dataset. Results: In the primary cohort, the radiomics signatures from 4 models provided an AUC of 0.637, 0.709, 0.753, 0.835, respectively in LN re-evaluation after chemoradiotheray. The diagnostic efficacy of model 4 was much better than that of 1, 2 and 3 model.

Studies on diverse nanoparticles provide a better understanding of different EPR effects depending on their structure, physicochemical properties, and chemical modifications. Recently the tumor microenvironment has been considered as another important factor for determining tumor-targeted delivery of nanoparticles, but the correlation between EPR effects and tumor microenvironment has not yet been fully elucidated. Herein, ectopic subcutaneous tumor models presenting different tumor microenvironments were established by inoculation of SCC7, U87, HT29, PC3, and A549 cancer cell lines into athymic nude mice, respectively. In the five different types of tumor-bearing mice, tumor-targeted delivery of self-assembled glycol chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) were comparatively evaluated to identify the correlation between the tumor microenvironments and targeted delivery of CNPs. As a result, neovascularization and extents of intratumoral extracellular matrix (ECM) were both important in determining the tumor targeted delivery of CNPs. The EPR effect was maximized in the tumors which include large extent of angiogenic blood vessels and low intratumoral ECM content.

However, objective measures of cardiac function and health-related quality of life are lacking in long-term follow-up of patients who remain cancer free after completion of adjuvant treatment. Patients and Methods: Patients in NSABP Protocol B-31 received anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab for adjuvant treatment of node-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive early-stage breast cancer. A long-term follow-up assessment was undertaken for patients who were alive and disease free, which included measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction by multigated acquisition scan along with patient-reported outcomes using the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI), the Medical Outcomes Study questionnaire, and a review of current medications and comorbid conditions. Results: At a median follow-up of 8.8 years among eligible participants, five (4.5%) of 110 in the control group and 10 (3.4%) of 297 in the trastuzumab group had a. 10% decline in left ventricular ejection fraction from baseline to a value, 50%. Lower DASI scores correlated with age and use of medications for hypertension, cardiac conditions, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, but not with whether patients had received trastuzumab. Conclusion: In patients without underlying cardiac disease at baseline, the addition of trastuzumab to adjuvant anthracycline and taxane-based chemotherapy does not result in long-term worsening of cardiac function, cardiac symptoms, or health-related quality of life. The DASI questionnaire may provide a simple and useful tool for monitoring patient-reported changes that reflect cardiac function. © 2017 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,Article,Scopus

To this end, standard chemotherapeutic approaches have relied on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of cytotoxic drugs with a long off-therapy interval, leading to heavy toxic side effects accompanied by drug resistance. To avoid the problems associated with the traditional MTD chemotherapy, metronomic chemotherapy with relatively low dose continuous treatments of cytotoxic drugs has been proposed as an alternative to the predominant paradigm of directly killing all cancer cells. Low-dose metronomic (LDM) chemotherapy is expected to have not only antitumor effects without toxicity and drug resistance, but also beneficial anti-angiogenic effects by causing selective apoptosis of tumor endothelial cells. In an attempt to keep the drug resistance under control and halt exponential tumor growth, herein, we combined LDM chemotherapy with a second anti-angiogenic strategy. The selective blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in combination with metronomic doxorubicin (Dox) induced synergistic antitumor effects mainly through an antiangiogenic mechanism. For specific VEGF suppression, VEGF-targeting siRNA was delivered to tumor tissue using polymerized siRNA/thiolated glycol chitosan (poly-siVEGF/tGC) nanoparticles, leading to efficient VEGF gene knockdown in tumor tissue with a sequence-specific manner. Although the single treatment with metronomic Dox and poly-siVEGF/tGC nanoparticles alone showed some antitumor activity, notably, the combination of the two therapies resulted in superb tumor regression without causing systemic toxicity or drug resistance. Thus, these results suggest that the VEGF-targeted RNAi using poly-siRNA/tGC nanoparticles in combination with LDM chemotherapy could be a promising synergistic strategy for controlling tumor growth by enhancing the efficacy of anti-angiogenesis while minimizing toxicity and drug resistance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anti-angiogenesis; Combination therapy; Drug resistance; Low-dose metronomic chemotherapy; siRNA; VEGF",Article,Scopus

The barriers are significant and varied; increased diffusional distances, elevated interstitial fluid pressure, regions of dense extracellular matrix and high cell density, and overall heterogeneity. Such a long list imposes significant requirements on nano-sized carriers. Unfortunately, other capabilities are eclipsed by the distribution requirements. A drug can do no good until it reaches its target. Numerous strategies to improve drug distribution have been developed, taking account of various unique characteristics of solid tumors, including some mechanisms that are still not fully understood. Most of these strategies were from small animal tumor models which are our primary tool for understanding cancer physiology. The small animal tumor model is the most versatile and effective means of understanding tumor transport, but its prevalence belies some of its weaknesses. Tumors grown under lab conditions are developed much more quickly than naturally developed cancers, potentially impacting tumor heterogeneity, blood vessel development, extracellular matrix organization, cell diversity, and many other features of structure and physiology that may impact transport. These problems come in addition to the difficulties of making precise measurements within a living tumor. Resolving these problems is best done by improving our analysis methods, and by finding complementary models that can clarify and expound the details. In this review, we will first discuss some of the strategies employed to improve transport and then highlight some of the new models that have recently been developed in the Bae lab and how they may aid in the study of tumor transport in the future. © 2017","Extravasation; Intratumoral distribution; Nanoparticle delivery; Predictive power; Solid tumors; Tumor models",Article,Scopus

Model updating may improve predictions. Previously suggested methods vary in their extensiveness of updating the model. We aim to define a strategy in selecting an appropriate update method that considers the balance between the amount of evidence for updating in the new patient sample and the danger of overfitting. We consider recalibration in the large (re-estimation of model intercept); recalibration (re-estimation of intercept and slope) and model revision (re-estimation of all coefficients) as update methods. We propose a closed testing procedure that allows the extensiveness of the updating to increase progressively from a minimum (the original model) to a maximum (a completely revised model). The procedure involves multiple testing with maintaining approximately the chosen type I error rate. We illustrate this approach with three clinical examples: patients with prostate cancer, traumatic brain injury and children presenting with fever. The need for updating the prostate cancer model was completely driven by a different model intercept in the update sample (adjustment: 2.58). Separate testing of model revision against the original model showed statistically significant results, but led to overfitting (calibration slope at internal validation = 0.86). The closed testing procedure selected recalibration in the large as update method, without overfitting. The advantage of the closed testing procedure was confirmed by the other two examples. We conclude that the proposed closed testing procedure may be useful in selecting appropriate update methods for previously developed prediction models. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Methods: Fifty nine histopathologically-proven rectal adenocarcinoma patients through biopsy treated with nCRT before total mesorectal excision were enrolled in this retrospective study. The first MRI examination (pre-nCRT MRI) was performed before nCRT, and the second one (early nCRT MRI) was performed at the third week of nCRT. The texture parameters values were measured, including mean value, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, uniformity, energy, and entropy. Tumoral downstaging was determined by comparing the pre-nCRT clinical T stage(cT stage) with the ypT stage. The patients were divided into downstaging and non downstaging group based on postoperative T staging. Parameters were compared between pre-and early nCRT in terms of averages using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Downstaging and non downstaging groups were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed using the statistically significant parameters between the two groups as independent variables. ROC analysis was performed on the new independent variables obtained by multi-parameter logistic regression analysis and the single parameter independent variables. The diagnostic efficiency of the parameters were evaluated. Results: T-downstaging were found in 28 patients after nCRT. The stdDeviation, kurtosis, and uniformity were significantly different between pre-and early nCRT (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in mean value, skewness, energy, and entropy between pre-and early nCRT (P>0.05). The pre-nCRT, uniformity, energy, entropy and the early nCRT mean value, entropy were significantly different in patients with downstaging vs. non downstaging (P<0.05). For the pre-nCRT stdDeviation, uniformity, energy, entropy and the early nCRT mean value, entropy, ROC analysis showed an area under curve(AUC) of 0.69, 0.76, 0.68, 0.67 and 0.65, 0.68, respectively. The multivariate logistic regression analysis for the four pre-nCRT independent variables (stdDeviation, uniformity, energy, entropy) achieved logical variable 1, and the logical variable 1 achieved an AUC of 0.78 to discriminate patients with T-downstaging from patients with non downstaging. The multivariate logistic regression analysis for the two early nCRT independent variables (mean value, entropy) achieved logical variable 2, and the logical variable 2 achieved an AUC of 0.69 to predict T-downstaging.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the specific killing effect of 131I-labeled B2-S22-AFA on breast cancer cell with overexpressing HER-2. Methods: 131I-B2-S22-AFA was prepared by using N-bromosuccinimide method to measure the labeling efficiency, radiochemical purity, stability, and immunocompetence. The expression levels of HER-2 in SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231 cells were detected by Immunohistochemistry and Western Blot. The inhibitory rate of B2-S22-AFA on cell growth was observed with epidermal growth factors (EGF) at different concentrations. Five groups i.e, B2-S22-AFA group (B2-S22-AFA final concentration: 1µg·mL-1), 131I-B2-S22-AFA group (131I-B2-S22-AFA final concentration: 144 kBq/1 µg·mL-1), 131I group (131I final concentration: 144 kBq·mL-1), negative control group and reagent blank group, were selected for contrast tests with the final concentration of EGF in each group at 5.0 pg·mL-1. The proliferation and activity of cells were measured by Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay. The inhibitory rates were compared among 131I-B2-S22-AFA group, B2-S22-AFA group and 131I group in the growth of the two kinds of cells at different time. Results: 1) HER-2 receptors were strongly expressed in SKBR3 cells while weakly (low) or no expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells. The radiochemical purity, labeling rate and specific activity of 131I-B2-S22-AFA were 95.0%-97.6%, 64.8%-79.6% and 151.7 MBq·mg-1, respectively. Radiochemical purity of 131I-B2-S22-AFA was 95.4%, 93.5%, 91.4%, 88.2% and 77.4% when it was placed at 37℃ in serum for 4 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively. The maximum binding rates of SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231 cells were (66.47±3.24)% and (3.89±0.81)% (tested for 3 times) respectively. 2) The inhibitory effect of B2-S22-AFA on the growth of SKBR3 cells only in the presence of EGF. 3) The killing effect of 131I-B2-S22-AFA on SKBR3 cells was significantly stronger than that of B2-S22-AFA and 131I (p&lt;0.05), and the inhibitory effect of B2-S22-AFA on the growth of SKBR3 cells was significantly higher than that of 131I (p&lt;0.05). 131I-B2-S22-AFA and B2-S22-AFA had no obvious killing effect on MDA-MB-231 cells.

The primary dataset consisted of patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC from October 2007 to April 2012, while independent validation was conducted from May 2012 to December 2014. All the patients underwent non-enhanced and contrast-enhanced CT images scan with a standard protocol. The pathological stage (PTNM) of patients with NSCLC were determined by the intraoperative and postoperative pathological findings, and were divided into early stage (Ⅰ,Ⅱ stage) and advanced stage (Ⅲ,Ⅳ stage).

Extensive simulations and free energy of binding analyses has shown that steric hindrance does not explain appropriately the mechanism for resistance against Erlotinib therapy for this variant.

Delivering effective and sustained treatments to the invasive GBM cells intermixed with functioning neural elements is a major goal of advanced therapeutic systems for brain cancer. Previously, we investigated the nanoparticle characteristics that enable targeting of invasive GBM cells. This revealed the importance of minimizing non-specific binding within the relatively adhesive, ‘sticky’ microenvironment of the brain and brain tumors in particular. We refer to such nanoformulations with decreased non-specific adhesivity and receptor targeting as ‘DART’ therapeutics. In this work, we applied this information toward the design and characterization of biodegradable nanocarriers, and in vivo testing in orthotopic experimental gliomas. We formulated particulate nanocarriers using poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and PLGA-polyethylene glycol (PLGA-PEG) polymers to generate sub-100 nm nanoparticles with minimal binding to extracellular brain components and strong binding to the Fn14 receptor – an upregulated, conserved component in invasive GBM. Multiple particle tracking in brain tissue slices and in vivo testing in orthotopic murine malignant glioma revealed preserved nanoparticle diffusivity and increased uptake in brain tumor cells. These combined characteristics also resulted in longer retention of the DART nanoparticles within the orthotopic tumors compared to non-targeted versions. Taken together, these results and nanoparticle design considerations offer promising new methods to optimize therapeutic nanocarriers for improving drug delivery and treatment for invasive brain tumors. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biodegradable nanoparticles; Fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14; Glioblastoma; Invasive malignant glioma; Multiple particle tracking; Surface plasmon resonance; Targeted therapeutics",Article,Scopus

Methods: A total of 22 advanced pancreatic carcinoma patients underwent CT guided radioactive seeds implantation were retrospectively analyzed. Ten patients were treated with coplanar template-assisted with an average age of (65±10) years (48 to 77 years). Tweleve patients were treated without coplanar template assist with an average age of (68±13) years (47 to 84 years). The preoperative planning designs and postoperative dosimetry verifications were performed for all patients. The dose related parameters including D90, MPD, V100, V150 and V200 were compared between pre and post operation by t test. The operating time were also evaluated between the two groups. Results: Overall the 22 patients were treated successfully without serious surgery-related complications. An average of 26 seeds were implanted in the coplanar template assisted implantation group, and 23 seeds were implanted in the non template-assisted implantation group.

Postoperative V150 in both groups were (57.83±7.74) % and (63.97±7.75) % separately. Preoperative D90 in both groups were (152.41±6.78) Gy and (153.30±7.79) Gy separately. Preoperative V150 in both groups were (58.61±14.11) % and (62.45±6.49) % separately. Postoperative MPD in both groups were (87.64±10.60) Gy and (87.12±7.66) Gy separately. Postoperative V200 in both groups were (34.12±7.67) %, (39.42±7.18) % separately. Preoperative MPD in both groups were (82.12±7.81) Gy and (83.43±4.86) Gy separately. Preoperative V200 in both groups were (29.04±10.64) %, (36.11±7.22) % separately. Compared with preoperative plans, the mean value of D90 and V100 decreased while the mean value of MPD and V200 increased in postoperative verifications in both coplanar template assist CT guided radioactive seeds implantation group and non template-assisted group. However, there was no significant difference between pre and post operation except for V100 (P&lt;0.05). The operating time of coplanar template assist group and non template-assisted group were (44.3±12.4) min and (60.0±12.8) min respectively. The difference of operating time between two groups were statistically significant (P&lt;0.05).

Herein, we describe these correlates and analyze their association with outcome. Patients and Methods: Genomic DNA was analyzed for TP53, CTNNB1, CDKN1C, ATRX, and chromosome 11p15 abnormalities. β-catenin expression and Ki-67 labeling index (LI) were evaluated by immunostaining. Primary end points were progression-free (PFS) and overall survival. Results: Median age of 42 girls and 18 boys was 3.3 years (range, 0.25 to 21.7 years). Complete resection (stages I and II) was achieved in 32 patients, and 28 patients had stage III or IV disease. Constitutional abnormalities of chromosome 11p15 occurred in nine of 40 patients, with six patients not showing phenotype of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Three-year PFS and overall survival for all patients were 71.4% and 80.5%, respectively.

Ki-67 LI and age remained significantly associated with PFS after adjusting for stage and tumor weight. Three-year PFS for 27 patients with Ki-67 LI ≥ 15% was 48.5% compared with 96.2% for 29 patients with Ki-67 LI, 15% (log-rank P =.002), and the rate of relapse increased by 24% with each 1-year increase in age at diagnosis (hazard ratio, 1.24; P =.0057). Conclusion: Clinicopathologic features and outcomes of children with ACTs without germline TP53 mutations overlapped those reported for children with germline TP53 mutations.

We sought to comprehensively profile pediatric AML microRNA (miRNA) samples to identify dysregulated genes and assess the utility of miRNAs for improved outcome prediction. Patients and Methods: To identify miRNA biomarkers that are associated with treatment failure, we performed a comprehensive sequence-based characterization of the pediatric AML miRNA landscape. miRNA sequencing was performed on 1,362 samples-1,303 primary, 22 refractory, and 37 relapse samples. One hundred sixty-four matched samples-127 primary and 37 relapse samples-were analyzed by using RNA sequencing. Results: By using penalized lasso Cox proportional hazards regression, we identified 36 miRNAs the expression levels at diagnosis of which were highly associated with event-free survival. Combined expression of the 36 miRNAs was used to create a novel miRNA-based risk classification scheme (AMLmiR36). This new miRNA-based risk classifier identifies those patients who are at high risk (hazard ratio, 2.830; P ≤.001) or low risk (hazard ratio, 0.323; P ≤.001) of experiencing treatment failure, independent of conventional karyotype or mutation status. The performance of AMLmiR36 was independently assessed by using 878 patients from two different clinical trials (AAML0531 and AAML1031). Our analysis also revealed that miR-106a-363 was abundantly expressed in relapse and refractory samples, and several candidate targets of miR-106a-5p were involved in oxidative phosphorylation, a process that is suppressed in treatment-resistant leukemic cells. Conclusion: To assess the utility of miRNAs for outcome prediction in patients with pediatric AML, we designed and validated a miRNA-based risk classification scheme. We also hypothesized that the abundant expression of miR-106a could increase treatment resistance via modulation of genes that are involved in oxidative phosphorylation. © 2017 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,Article,Scopus

Understanding of the in vivo fate of drug nanocrystals is however very limited. In this study, we utilized the hybrid nanocrystal concept and studied the kinetic process of dissolution in cancer cells. By taking advantage of aggregation-induced emission (AIE), hybrid paclitaxel (PTX) nanocrystals integrated with tetraphenylethene (TPE) enabled a novel way for estimating the intracellular dissolution process of the nanocrystals. When TPE is entrapped in a nanocrystal, fluorescence is emitted when the nanocrystal is optically excited. When an entrapped TPE molecule is released to a liquid medium due to the dissolution of the nanocrystal, its fluorescence is quenched. By monitoring the change in fluorescence, it is possible to quantify the dissolution of nanocrystals in a biological environment. Cellular uptake studies of hybrid nanocrystals were conducted with KB and HT-29 cell lines and characterized by confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and HPLC. The results suggest that drug nanocrystals were taken up directly by the cells, and subsequently dissolved in the cytoplasm.

Methods: One hundred and sixty pathologically confirmed lung adenocarcinomas from November 2011 to December 2014 were included as primary cohort. Seventy-six lung adenocarcinomas from November 2014 to December 2015 were set as an independent validation cohort. Lasso regression analysis was used for feature selection and radiomics signature building. Radiomics score was calculated by the linear fusion of selected features. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to develop models. The prediction performances were evaluated with ROC analysis and AUC, and the different prediction performance between different models and mean CT value were compared with Delong test. The generalization ability was evaluated with the leave-one-out cross-validation method. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated in terms of its calibration. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to evaluate the significance between the predictive and observe values. Results: Four hundred and eighty-five 3D features were extracted and reduced to 2 features as the most important discriminators to build the radiomics signatures. The individualized prediction model was developed with age, radiomics signature, spiculation and pleural indentation, which had the best discrimination performance (AUC=0.934) in comparison with other models and mean CT value(P<0.05) and showed better performance compared with the clinical model (AUC=0.743, P<0.001). The radiomics-based nomogram demonstrated good calibration in the primary and validation cohort, and showed improved differential diagnosis performance with an AUC of 0.956 in the independent validation cohort. Conclusion: Individualized prediction model incorporating with age, radiomics signature, spiculation and pleural indentation, presenting with radiomics nomogram, could differentiate IAC from 'non-invasive’ lesion manifesting as GGN with the best performance in comparison with morphological features and quantitative imaging.

In the past, a multitude of nanomedicine studies have sought to enhance the specificity of drug delivery to target sites by focusing on receptors overexpressed on malignant cells or environmental features of diseases sites. Despite these immense efforts, however, there are few clinically available nanomedicines. We need a paradigm shift in drug delivery. One strategy that may overcome the limitations of pathophysiology-based drug delivery is the use of remotely controlled delivery technology. Unlike pathophysiology-based active drug targeting strategies, light-switchable systems are not affected by the heterogeneity of cells, tissue types, and/or microenvironments. Instead, they are triggered by remote light (i.e., near-infrared) stimuli, which are absorbed by photoresponsive molecules or three-dimensional nanostructures. The sequential conversion of light to heat or reactive oxygen species can activate drug release and allow it to be spatio-temporally controlled. Light-switchable systems have been used to activate endosomal drug escape, modulate the release of chemical and biological drugs, and alter nanoparticle structures to control the release rates of drugs. This review will address the limitations of pathophysiology-based drug delivery systems, the current status of light-based remote-switch systems, and future directions in the application of light-switchable systems for remotely controlled drug delivery. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Light-switchable system; Photochemical activation; Photoisomerization; Photothermal activation; Remotely controlled delivery",Article,Scopus

Downregulation of these pathways in the T cells via RNA interference (RNAi) could significantly boost their capacity to infiltrate tumors, proliferate, persist, and eradicate tumor cells, thus leading to a durable anti-tumor response. Unfortunately, it is well known that primary T cells are hard-to-transfect and conventional non-viral transfection agents are generally ineffective. Viral transduction and electroporation are more efficient but their use is restricted by high cost, safety issues, and cytotoxicity. Photoporation has recently gained interest as a more gentle alternative physical approach to deliver membrane-impermeable macromolecules into cells. By attaching gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to the cell surface followed by pulsed laser illumination, transient membrane pores can be generated that allow the diffusion of macromolecules directly into the cell cytosol. Here, we evaluated this technique for the non-toxic and effective delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) and subsequent silencing of target genes in activated CTLs. We compared photoporation with nucleofection, the current standard physical technique for T cell transfection, and demonstrated a significantly reduced cytotoxicity and higher average dose per cell for the photoporation technique. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adoptive T cell therapy; Gold nanoparticles; Photoporation; siRNA; Vapor nanobubbles",Article,Scopus

Methods: Eighty eight patients (36 benign and 52 malignant) with diagnosis of MRI BI-RADS 4 in our hospital from December 2014 to December 2015 were retrospectively enrolled in this study. All the patients were proved by pathology and examined by sequence of T 1 WI, T 2 WI, DWI and dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), and then were further sub-categorized into BI-RADS 4A, BI-RADS 4B, or BI-RADS 4C based on DCE-MRI sequence. Thus positive predictive value (PPV) of each sub-category were calculated and ROC were used to describe its efficiency in differential diagnosis. Radiomics features based on ADC map were generated automatically from Analysis-Kinetics (GE Healthcare). Sixty three of the 88 cases randomized-selected by computer were used to establish forecasting models and other 25 cases for validation. Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman were introduced to reduce radiomics features that were highly correlated with others. Logistic linear regression (LLR) model was constructed based on the selected features by 'glm’ function in R software and then verified by 10-fold cross validation (repeat 10 times). ROC was curved to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the model. Results: The PPV of BI-RADS 4A,4B,4C were 16.7% (2/12),59.6% (28/47),75.9% (22/29) respectively. Area under curve (AUC) of ROC was 0.650, sensitivity and specificity were 76.9% and 45.9% respectively. Three hundred and ninety six radiomics features were extracted automatically by software and 5 features (size zone variability, difference entropy, zone percentage, intensity variability and inverse difference moment) were left after redundancy reduction step. Cross-validation showed the accuracy of Logistic regression model was 80.0% (20/25), AUC was 0.790, sensitivity and specificity were 81.3% and 77.8% when cut-off was 0.45.

PL significantly suppressed bladder cancer cell proliferation, the transition of G2/M phase to next phase, migration/invasion in vitro and bladder cancer growth/development in vivo. PL markedly elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the administration of antioxidants abolished PL induced cell proliferation inhibition, G2/M phase arrest and migration suppression on bladder cancer cells.

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate changes in serum N-glycoproteins and their glycosylation status prior to clinical presentation of pancreatic cancer that may be potential biomarkers. Prediagnosis serum samples pooled according to five time-to-diagnosis groups and a non-cancer control pool were digested with trypsin, labelled with mass tags, and subjected to titanium dioxide capture, deglycosylation, and 2D-LC-MS/MS profiling. Unbound peptides were profiled in parallel. Across the sample groups, 703 proteins were quantified and 426 putative sites of N-glycosylation were identified with evidence of several novel sites. Altered proteins with biomarker potential were predominantly abundant inflammatory response, coagulation, and immune-related proteins. Whilst glycopeptide profiles largely paralleled those of their parent proteins, there was evidence of altered N-glycosylation site occupancy or sialic acid content prior to diagnosis for some proteins, most notably of immunoglobulin gamma chains. α-1-Antitrypsin was tested as a biomarker, but found not to complement carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) in early detection of cancer. In conclusion, we provide preliminary evidence of altered glycosylation of several serum proteins prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis, warranting further investigation of these proteins as early biomarkers. These changes may be largely driven by inflammatory processes that occur in response to tumour formation and progression. © 2017 by the authors.

A quantitative landscape of morbidity of survivors, however, has not been described. We aimed to describe the cumulative burden of curative cancer therapy in a clinically assessed ageing population of long-term survivors of childhood cancer. Methods The St Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (SJLIFE) retrospectively collected data on CHCs in all patients treated for childhood cancer at the St Jude Children's Research Hospital who survived 10 years or longer from initial diagnosis and were 18 years or older as of June 30, 2015. Age-matched and sex-frequency-matched community controls were used for comparison. 21 treatment exposure variables were included in the analysis, with data abstracted from medical records. 168 CHCs for all participants were graded for severity using a modified Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events. Multiple imputation with predictive mean matching was used for missing occurrences and grades of CHCs in the survivors who were not clinically evaluable. Mean cumulative count was used for descriptive cumulative burden analysis and marked-point-process regression was used for inferential cumulative burden analysis. Findings Of 5522 patients treated for childhood cancer at St Jude Children's Research Hospital who had complete records, survived 10 years or longer, and were 18 years or older at time of study, 3010 (54·5%) were alive, had enrolled, and had had prospective clinical assessment. 2512 (45·5%) of the 5522 patients were not clinically evaluable. The cumulative incidence of CHCs at age 50 years was 99·9% (95% CI 99·9–99·9) for grade 1–5 CHCs and 96·0% (95% CI 95·3–96·8%) for grade 3–5 CHCs. By age 50 years, a survivor had experienced, on average, 17·1 (95% CI 16·2–18·1) CHCs of any grade, of which 4·7 (4·6–4·9) were CHCs of grade 3–5. The cumulative burden in matched community controls of grade 1–5 CHCs was 9·2 (95% CI 7·9–10·6; p<0·0001 vs total study population) and of grade 3–5 CHCs was 2·3 (1·9–2·7, p<0·0001 vs total study population). Second neoplasms, spinal disorders, and pulmonary disease were major contributors to the excess total cumulative burden. Notable heterogeneity in the distribution of CHC burden in survivors with differing primary cancer diagnoses was observed. The cumulative burden of grade 1–5 CHCs at age 50 years was highest in survivors of CNS malignancies (24·2 [95% CI 20·9–27·5]) and lowest in survivors of germ cell tumours (14·0 [11·5–16·6]). Multivariable analyses showed that older age at diagnosis, treatment era, and higher doses of brain and chest radiation are significantly associated with a greater cumulative burden and severity of CHCs. Interpretation The burden of CHCs in survivors of childhood cancer is substantial and highly variable. Our assessment of total cumulative burden in survivors of paediatric cancer, with detailed characterisation of long-term CHCs, provide data to better inform future clinical guidelines, research investigations, and health services planning for this vulnerable, medically complex population.

Dissemination and infiltration of cancer cells to the peritoneum result in cancer peritoneal metastasis which is an important prognostic factor of intraperitoneal or intrapelvic carcinoma. To elucidate an initial metastatic mechanism of cancer cells, in vitro human peritoneal models are demanded. In this study, we created a three-dimensional artificial human peritoneal tissue (AHPT) harboring the blood or lymphatic vascular network by cell-accumulation technique. Morphological analysis demonstrated that AHPT had mesothelial monolayer with polygonal flat cells with apical microvilli, and stroma-like structure containing fibroblasts surrounded by extracellular matrix and blood or lymphatic vascular network. To assess AHPT as a tool for cancer peritoneal metastasis model, colon and ovarian cancer cells (HT-29 and SKOV3) were seeded onto AHPT. HT-29 cells showed poor metastatic characteristics forming thick clusters in mesothelial layer without invasion into stroma-like structure. On the other hand, SKOV3 cells rapidly invaded intercellular spaces between mesothelial cells and then spread over the stroma-like structure accompanying lymphatic invasion, showing aggressive metastatic characteristics. These results demonstrated that the metastatic dynamics of cancer cells with different characteristics are able to visualized by AHPT, suggesting that this tissue can be a powerful tool for the basic research of cancer peritoneal dissemination and metastasis. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Cancer peritoneal metastasis; Cell-accumulation technique; Human peritoneal model; Tissue engineering",Article,Scopus

Novel treatments are required to improve patient survival. Immune therapy against cancer is promising; however, therapeutic vaccination has been limited by the inability of tumor antigens to induce effective immune responses. Chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) was previously identified as a possible tumor marker for OC. In this study, we constructed a recombinant protein by conjugating the extracellular domain of CLIC1 to the carboxyl terminus of Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat shock protein 70 (MtHsp70). Human dendritic cells (DCs) derived from cortical blood were pulsed with the fusion protein, and the antitumor effect of human cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) stimulated by autologous DCs was assessed in NOG mice. MtHsp70-CLIC1 promoted the phenotypic maturation of human DCs and the secretion of Th1-associated cytokines in vitro. MtHsp70-CLIC1-stimulated CTLs generated a CLIC1-specific immune response both in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that DCs pulsed with MtHsp70-CLIC1 can enhance antitumor immunity against OC, providing a novel immune therapeutic strategy. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Chloride intracellular channel 1; Dendritic cell; Immune therapy; NOG mice; Ovarian cancer; Recombinant protein",Article,Scopus

However, the anticancer effect of luteoloside, a naturally occurring flavonoid isolated from the medicinal plant Gentiana macrophylla, on autophagy remains poorly understood in human lung cells. In the present study, we have investigated the anticancer effects of luteoloside on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and demonstrated that luteoloside effectively inhibited cancer cell proliferation, inducing G0/G1 phase arrest associated with reduced expression of CyclinE, CyclinD1 and CDK4; we further found that treatment with luteoloside did not strongly result in apoptotic cell death in NSCLC (A549 and H292) cells. Interestingly, luteoloside induced autophagy in lung cancer cells, which was correlated with the formation of autophagic vacuoles, breakdown of p62, and the overexpression of Beclin-1 and LC3-II, but not in a human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B). Notably, pretreatment of cancer cells with 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor, protected against autophagy and promoted cell viability but not apoptosis. To further clarify whether luteoloside-induced autophagy depended on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p70S6K signalling pathway, a major autophagy-suppressive cascade, cells were treated with a combination of AKT inhibitor (LY294002) and mTOR inhibitor (Rap). These results demonstrated that luteoloside induced autophagy in lung cancer cell lines by inhibiting the pathway at p-Akt (Ser473), p-mTOR and p-p70S6K (Thr389). Moreover, we observed that luteoloside-induced cell autophagy was correlated with production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). NAC-mediated protection against ROS clearly implicated ROS in the activation of autophagy and cell death. In addition, the results showed that ROS served as an upstream effector of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p70S6K pathway. Taken together, the present study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying luteoloside-mediated cell death in NSCLC cells and supports luteoloside as a potential anti-cancer agent for targeting NSCLC through the induction of autophagy, inhibition of proliferation and PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p70S6K signalling. © 2017","AKT/mTOR/p70S6K signalling; Autophagy; G0/G1 arrest; Luteoloside; NSCLCs; ROS",Article,Scopus

Colorectal cancer cells, HT-29, HCT-15, and HCT 116, showing low, medium, and high sensitivity to IR, respectively, were treated with the combinations of FTD and IR, and evaluated by the clonogenic survival assay. The radiation dose modification factors (DMFs) were calculated as the ratio of radiation doses producing equivalent surviving fractions following the FTD/IR treatment, or IR alone. DMFs of 4 μM FTD followed by 8 Gy of IR were 2.7, 1.5, and 1.2 for HT-29, HCT-15, and HCT 116, respectively, whereas those of 8 Gy of IR followed by FTD were 1.6, 1.4, and 1.0 for these cells, respectively. Intracellular DNA double-strand break levels after IR and FTD were significantly higher than those observed following the IR treatment alone, regardless of whether the IR was applied before or after FTD. RAD51 expression levels were shown to be increased in FTD and IR treated cells. Apoptotic proteins, such as cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3, were detected in cells treated with the combination of FTD and IR, while their expression was not significantly induced after IR or FTD treatment alone. These findings suggest that FTD enhances the efficacy of IR and provide a rationale for designing novel combination chemoradiotherapy regimens containing FTD for patients with rectal cancer that are insensitive to the radiation treatment. © 2017 The Authors","Chemoradiotherapy; Colorectal cancer; Radiosensitivity; TAS-102; Tipiracil; Trifluridine",Article,Scopus

In this work, a two-stage hierarchical method is proposed to detect and recognize different life stages of bladder cells by using two cascade Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Initially, a hybrid object proposal algorithm (called EdgeSelective) by combining EdgeBoxes and Selective Search is proposed to generate candidate object proposals instead of a single Selective Search method in Region-CNN (R-CNN), and it can exploit the advantages of different mechanisms for generating proposals so that each cell in the image can be fully contained by at least one proposed region during the detection process. Then the obtained cells from the previous step are used to train and extract features by employing CNNs for the purpose of cell life stage recognition. Finally, a series of comparison experiments are implemented. The results show that the proposed method can obtain better performance than traditional methods either in the stage of cell detection or cell life stage recognition, and it encourages and suggests the application in the development of new anticancer drug and cytopathology analysis of cancer patients in the near future.

Meanwhile, K+ channels are particularly important in regulating the endocrine and exocrine functions of pancreas. However, the expression pattern and prognostic significance of K+ channels in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain unknown. In this study, by screening a GEO dataset containing 36 microdissected PDAC and matching normal pancreatic tissue samples, four differentially expressed K+ channels (KCNJ5, KCNJ16, KCNN4 and KCNK1) were identified in PDAC. by immunohistochemical analysis of pancreatic tissue sections from Pdx1-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice (KC), Pdx1-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D/+; LSL-Trp53R172H/+ mice (KPC) and human PDAC tissue microarrays, we found that Ca2+-activated K+ channel KCNN4 was significantly elevated in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and PDAC epithelia compared with untransformed pancreas tissues. Higher epithelial KCNN4 expression was closely correlated with advanced TNM stages and predicted a poor prognosis in patients with PDAC. Elevated KCNN4 expression was significantly associated with shorter survival in univariable and multivariable analyses. Collectively, the identification of expression pattern of K+ channels in PDAC and its precursor PanIN demonstrates the importance of KCNN4 channel during the malignant transformation of PDAC.

In this research, the biological function and the underlying molecular mechanism of regenerating protein 1 alpha (REG1A) in GC were investigated. Material/Methods: Gene expression omnibus (GEO), KMplot datasets and GC tissue microarray (n=164) were used to analyze the expression of REG1A and related patient prognoses in GC. Transwell matrigel assay, flow cytometry analysis and CCK8 cell viability assay were performed to detect the biological functions of REG1A. Western blotting and real-time PCR were used to detect the REG1A expression and PI3K/Akt related signaling. Results: It was found that the expression of REG1A was significantly downregulated in GC and closely related with clinicopathological findings or patient prognoses. REG1A overexpression could suppress the invasion, cell viability and promote the apoptosis of GC cells. Moreover, we found that the epigenetic methylation suppressed the expression level of REG1A in GC, and REG1A overexpression could suppress the phosphorylation of Akt or GSK3b signaling. Conclusions: Taken together, REG1A regulates cell invasion, apoptosis and viability in GC through activating PI3K/Akt-GSK3b signaling.

An analysis that employed the SurvExpress database indicated that increased expression of YY1AP1 mRNA was significantly associated with the overall survival of COAD patients. To clarify the validity of YY1AP1 or PCNA as determined by the IHC analysis was performed on 59 paired samples from COAD and adjacent normal tissue. Statistically significant differences of immunoreactivity for YY1AP1 or PCNA protein expression was observed between COAD tissue and adjacent normal tissue. High protein expression levels of YY1AP1 and PCNA were also found to be significantly correlated with M-class and distant metastasis. We also determined that YY1AP1 was correlated with PCNA expression in COAD samples, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that YY1AP1 protein expression was significantly associated with poor survival. Finally, a univariate analysis demonstrated that YY1AP1 protein expression was related to YY1AP1 score, and multivariate analysis revealed that the YY1AP1 protein expression level was an independent risk factor of overall COAD survival.

Recently, α -LA has been reported to inhibit the growth of various cancer cells, but the precise signaling pathways that mediate the effects of α -LA on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development remain unclear. Methods The CCK-8 assay was used to assess cell proliferation in NSCLC cell lines after α -LA treatment. The expression of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-2, CDK4, CDK6, Cyclin D3, Cyclin E1, Ras, c-Raf, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ERK1/2 and activated EGFR and ERK1/2 was evaluated by western blotting. Grb2 levels were restored in α-LA-treated cells by transfection of a plasmid carrying Grb2 and were reduced in NSCLC cells via specific siRNA-mediated knockdown. Results α -LA dramatically decreased NSCLC cell proliferation by downregulating Grb2; in contrast, Grb2 overexpression significantly prevented α-LA-induced decrease in cell growth in vitro. Western blot analysis indicated that α-LA decreased the levels of phospho-EGFR, CDK2/4/6, Cyclins D3 and E1, which are associated with the inhibition of G1/S-phase transition. Additional experiments indicated that Grb2 inhibition partially abolished EGF-induced phospho-EGFR and phospho-ERK1/2 activity. In addition, α-LA exerted greater inhibitory effects than gefitinib on NSCLC cells by preventing EGF-induced EGFR activation. Conclusion For the first time, these findings provide the first evidence that α-LA inhibits cell proliferation through Grb2 by suppressing EGFR phosphorylation and that MAPK/ERK is involved in this pathway. © 2017","Cell proliferation; EGFR; Grb2; NSCLC; α-lipoic acid",Article,Scopus

IRCR201, a c-Met antibody with species cross-reactivity, successfully inhibited the HGF/c-Met signaling pathway via degradation of c-Met and disruption of the binding with its partners, and demonstrated strong in vivo antitumor activity. In pharmacokinetic analysis, IRCR201 exhibited a nonlinear pharmacokinetic profile and showed rapid serum clearance at low dosage. Ex vivo fluorescence imaging and immunohistochemistry demonstrated strong tumor accumulation of IRCR201. Hepatotoxicity analysis revealed that IRCR201 does not significantly affect primary human and mouse hepatocytes. Serum chemistry analysis demonstrated that the alanine aminotransferase serum level was elevated in mice treated with 30 mg/kg IRCR201 than in PBS-treated mice, whereas the levels of aspartate aminotransferase and blood urea nitrogen did not significantly differ.

Recent studies showed that vasculogenic mimicry (VM), the formation of blood channels by aggressive cancer cells that mimic endothelial cells, is a factor contributing to poor prognosis in TNBC. Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) gene has been found to be highly expressed in TNBC, and has 4 major distinct isoforms; isoform A (−17AA/–KTS; −/−), isoform B (+17AA/–KTS; +/−), isoform C (−17AA/+KTS; −/+) and isoform D (+17AA/+KTS; +/+). The involvement of each WT1 isoform in TNBC progression remains largely unclear. In this study, WT1 isoform-overexpressing cell sublines were established from a TNBC cell line, MDA-MB-231, by stable transfection, and the aggressive behavior of the cell sublines were evaluated. Only the WT1 isoform B- and isoform C-overexpressing cell sublines showed the significant increase in VM forming capability compared to the parental cell line and other isoform cell sublines. qRT-PCR was used to explore the change in expression level of two VM-related genes, EphA2 and VE-cadherin. All WT1 isoform cell sublines showed up-regulation of EphA2 but the levels detected in the isoform B- and isoform C-cell sublines were higher than those observed in other cell sublines. In contrast, significant up-regulation of VE-cadherin was found only in isoform A- and isoform D-cell sublines. Isoform B- and isoform C-cell sublines showed higher rates of cell migration compared to those of other cell sublines, as determined by both wound healing and Transwell assays. Gelatin zymography revealed increased MMP-9 enzyme production in isoform D-cell subline compared to the parental cell line, but this change was not observed in other cell sublines. Western blot analysis showed significantly increased expression of β-catenin in isoform B- and isoform C-cell sublines, compared to parental cell line and other isoform cell sublines.

In order for CD8 T cells to kill tumor cells they need to enter into the tumor, migrate within the tumor microenvironment and respond adequately to tumor antigens. The recent development of improved imaging approaches, such as 2-photon microscopy, and the use of powerful mouse tumor models have shed light on some of the mechanisms that regulate anti-tumor T cell activities. Whereas such systems have provided valuable insights, they do not always predict human responses. In human, our knowledge in the field mainly comes from a description of fixed tumor samples from human patients, as well as in vitro studies. However, in vitro models lack the complex three-dimensional tumor milieu and, therefore, are incomplete approximations of in vivo T cell activities. Fresh slices made from explanted tissue represent a complex multi-cellular tumor environment that can act as an important link between co-cultured studies and animal models. Originally set up in murine lymph nodes1 and previously described in a JoVE article2, this approach has now been transposed to human tumors to examine the dynamics of both plated3 as well as resident T cells4. Here, a protocol for the preparation of human lung tumor slices, immunostaining of resident CD8 T and tumor cells, and tracking of CD8 T lymphocytes within the tumor microenvironment using confocal microscopy is described.

Tumor-bearing mice were treated with OTX008, Anginex, or Avastin and oxygen levels were determined by fiber-optics and molecular marker pimonidazole binding. Immuno-fluorescence was used to determine vessel normalization status. Continued OTX008 treatment caused a transient reoxygenation in SQ20B tumors peaking on day 14, while a steady increase in tumor oxygenation was observed over 21 days in the HEp-2 model. A &gt;50% decrease in immunohistochemical staining for tumor hypoxia verified the oxygenation data measured using a partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) probe. Additionally, OTX008 induced tumor vessel normalization as tumor pericyte coverage increased by approximately 40% without inducing any toxicity. Moreover, OTX008 inhibited tumor growth as effectively as Anginex and Avastin, except in the HEp-2 model where Avastin was found to suspend tumor growth. Galectin-1 inhibitor OTX008 transiently increased overall tumor oxygenation via vessel normalization to various degrees in both HNSCC models.

The classical inhibition of the mTOR pathway is performed by rapamycin and its analogs (rapalogs). Considering that rapamycin binds to an allosteric site and performs a crucial role in the inhibition of the mTOR complex without causing the deleterious side effects common to ATP-competitive inhibitors, we employ ligand-based drug design strategies, such as virtual screening methodology, computational determination of ADME/Tox properties of selected molecules, and molecular dynamics in order to select molecules with the potential to become non-ATP-competitive inhibitors of the mTOR enzymatic complex.

This study aimed to assess the expression levels of alternative splicing of DNMT3A variants and explore their roles in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DNMT3A variants gene expression were assessed, measuring their effects on cell proliferation. In addition, the expression of DNMT3A variants were evaluated in acute myeloid leukemia patients. Four DNMT3A variants were identified, with DNMT3A1 and DNMT3A2V found to be dominant in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. Moreover, DNMT3A2V overexpression delayed cell proliferation; while, DNMT3A2V R882H mutation promoted cell proliferation. Further, DNMT3A1 and DNMT3A2V were detected in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and controls with non-malignant hematological disease, with DNMT3A2V significantly up-regulated in AML patients. The main transcript switched from DNMT3A1 to DNMT3A2V in some patients, especially the low risk group based on the NCCN 2016 guidelines.

The E. coli xylose permease (XylE), a homologue of human GLUTs, has been investigated more thoroughly than other major facilitator proteins in the current literature. In this paper, we present a molecular dynamics (MD) study of an all-atom model system to elucidate the atomistic details and the free-energy landscape along the path of binding a xylopyranose (XYP) from the extracellular space to the inside of the transporter protein XylE. From the MD simulations, the Gibbs free energy of binding was found to be −4.4kcal/mol in agreement with the experimental value of −4.7kcal/mol. The accuracy of our study is further shown in the computed hydration energy of XYP of −14.6kcal/mol in comparison with the experimental data of −15.0kcal/mol. Along the binding path, the Gibbs free energy of the XYP-XylE complex first rises from zero in the dissociated state to approximately 4 kcal/mol in the transition state (when XylE slightly increases its opening toward the extracellular side to accommodate XYP) before dropping down to −9.0 kcal/mol in the bound state. These quantitative insights indicate the fast equilibration between the bound and the unbound states of XylE and XYP. They also serve as an atomistic-dynamic corroboration of the experimental conclusion that XylE is a high-affinity sugar transporter. © 2017 The Authors","Binding affinity; E. coli xylose permease; Free energy; Glucose transporter; Molecular dynamics; Transmembrane protein",Article,Scopus

The delivery of radiation was achieved using fixed radiation sources or linear accelerators producing megavoltage (MV) X-rays. These devices are unable to achieve sub-millimeter precision required for small animals. Furthermore, the high doses delivered to healthy surrounding tissue hamper response assessment. To increase the translation between small animal studies and humans, our goal was to mimic the treatment of human glioblastoma in a rat model. To enable a more accurate irradiation in a preclinical setting, recently, precision image-guided small animal radiation research platforms were developed. Similar to human planning systems, treatment planning on these micro-irradiators is based on computed tomography (CT). However, low soft-tissue contrast on CT makes it very challenging to localize targets in certain tissues, such as the brain. Therefore, incorporating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which has excellent soft-tissue contrast compared to CT, would enable a more precise delineation of the target for irradiation. In the last decade also biological imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) gained interest for radiation therapy treatment guidance. PET enables the visualization of e.g., glucose consumption, amino-acid transport, or hypoxia, present in the tumor. Targeting those highly proliferative or radio-resistant parts of the tumor with a higher dose could give a survival benefit. This hypothesis led to the introduction of the biological tumor volume (BTV), besides the conventional gross target volume (GTV), clinical target volume (CTV), and planned target volume (PTV). At the preclinical imaging lab of Ghent University, a micro-irradiator, a small animal PET, and a 7 T small animal MRI are available. The goal was to incorporate MRI-guided irradiation and PET-guided sub-volume boosting in a glioblastoma rat model. © 2017, Journal of Visualized Experiments.

Post-infectious IBS models in C57BL/6 mice were established and were pretreated with the PB, PB and probiotic strains 8 weeks in advance of infection. Eight weeks after infection, intestinal tissues were collected for assessing histomorphology, visceral sensitivity, barrier function, pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and proteomics analysis. Fecal samples were also collected for microbiota analysis. The pro-inflammatory cytokines expression in Caco-2 cells were evaluated after co-incubation with PB and Salmonella typhimurium 14028. The results showed that PB significantly decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines both in infected Caco-2 cells and PI-IBS models. The loss of body weight, decreased expression of tight junction protein Occludin (OCLN), and changes of the microbiota composition induced by infections could be greatly improved by PB intervention (p < 0.05).

Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that PACT interacts with LGP2 and that this interaction is enhanced by encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection. In vitro interaction analyses using purified recombinant proteins confirmed that the single-stranded Theiler's murine encephalitis virus genome enhanced the interaction between LGP2 and PACT. Small interfering RNA knockdown experiments further indicated that PACT is required for Cardiovirus-triggered interferon responses. To support this functional interaction with LGP2, overexpressed PACT was shown to enhance EMCV-triggered interferon promoter activity only when LGP2 and MDA5 were co-expressed but not when MDA5 is expressed alone.

Emerging data suggest that BARD1 can have both tumor-suppressor gene and oncogene functions in tumor initiation and progression. Indeed, whereas FL BARD1 protein acts as tumor-suppressor with and without BRCA1 interactions, aberrant splice variants of BARD1 have been detected in various cancers and have been shown to play an oncogenic role. Further evidence for a dualistic role came with the identification of BARD1 as a neuroblastoma predisposition gene in our genome wide association study which has demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms in BARD1 can correlate with risk or can protect against cancer based on their association with the expression of FL and splice variants of BARD1.

We evaluated the impact of a Rapid Investigation Clinic (RIC) on timeliness of lung cancer diagnosis and treatment between February 2010 and December 2011.METHODS: Investigation within the RIC was conducted by a pulmonologist and a nurse clinician. Controls were patients with lung cancer, investigated outside the RIC at the same institution during the same time period. The primary outcome was time between first contact with a local physician for suspected lung cancer (T0) and first treatment. Factors associated with the delay from T0 to first treatment were examined using multivariate analysis. Completeness of lung cancer staging according to guidelines was assessed.RESULTS: A total of 195 patients were investigated within the RIC vs. 132 patients outside the RIC. The median delay between T0 and first treatment was 65 days (interquartile range [IQR] 46-92 days) in the RIC and 78 days (IQR 49-119 days) in the non-RIC patients (p ≤ 0.01). Time from T0 to pathological diagnosis was shorter in the RIC (median 26 days; IQR 14-42 days) vs. non-RIC patients (median 40 days; IQR 16-68 days). In multivariate analysis, investigation in the RIC was associated with a reduction in time to first treatment of 24 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 12-35 days) when adjusted for relevant confounders. Guideline-concordant investigation occurred more frequently in RIC patients, based on the quality indicators examined.CONCLUSIONS: A Rapid Investigation Clinic reduces delays to lung cancer diagnosis and treatment, and impacts quality of care.","Delay; Lung cancer diagnosis; Neoplasm staging; Timeliness",Article,Scopus

Moreover, the S-1 plus oxaliplatin regimen is now a standard treatment. Nab-paclitaxel was developed for chemotherapy of gastric cancer in Japanese clinical practice. Nab-paclitaxel, created with albumin-bound paclitaxel particles, has high transferability to tumour tissues and does not cause hypersensitivity reactions because of a different chemical composition compared with docetaxel and paclitaxel. A combination of S-1, nab-paclitaxel and oxaliplatin (which we named 'SNOW regimen') can be a promising triplet therapy for advanced gastric cancer. Although we have to pay attention to chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, we aim to investigate the recommended dose of this regimen in a phase I study. Furthermore, we will investigate its efficacy and toxicity in a phase II study. Methods: The phase I study is a dose-escalation study using a standard 3 plus 3 design, followed by expansion cohorts. The SNOW regimen involves 28-day cycles with escalated doses of nab-paclitaxel (100-175 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15) and fixed doses of oxaliplatin (65 mg/ m2 on days 1 and 15) and S-1 (80 mg/m2/day on day 1 to 14). The primary endpoints are assessment of dose limiting toxicities and determination of maximum tolerated dose to investigate the recommended dose in the subsequent phase II study. In the phase II study, the primary endpoint is objective response rate. Secondary endpoints are assessment of safety, progression-free survival, disease control rate, overall survival and time to treatment failure. Adverse events were monitored and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Discussion: Triplet therapies for advanced gastric cancer patients have been evaluated in clinical trials. The SNOW regimen can be a promising new triplet therapy.

However, further translation of CRISPR/Cas9 for cancer gene therapy requires development of safe approaches for efficient, highly specific delivery of both Cas9 and single guide RNA to tumors. Here, novel core–shell nanostructure, liposome-templated hydrogel nanoparticles (LHNPs) that are optimized for efficient codelivery of Cas9 protein and nucleic acids is reported. It is demonstrated that, when coupled with the minicircle DNA technology, LHNPs deliver CRISPR/Cas9 with efficiency greater than commercial agent Lipofectamine 2000 in cell culture and can be engineered for targeted inhibition of genes in tumors, including tumors the brain. When CRISPR/Cas9 targeting a model therapeutic gene, polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), is delivered, LHNPs effectively inhibit tumor growth and improve tumor-bearing mouse survival. The results suggest LHNPs as versatile CRISPR/Cas9-delivery tool that can be adapted for experimentally studying the biology of cancer as well as for clinically translating cancer gene therapy. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the mechanism of ovarian cancer recurrence after chemotherapy has not been fully understood. In the present study, we investigated the effect of chemotherapy-induced tumor microenvironment on the proliferation of SKOV3 cells. We have shown that SKOV3 cells repopulated faster in the culture medium from apoptotic SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells after 24 h of etoposide phosphate (VP-16) treatment. We found that during apoptosis, cleaved caspase 3 could activate cytosolic calcium-independent phospholipase A2, which stimulated the release of arachidonic acid (AA) and triggered the production of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ). An increased level of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) subsequently facilitated the reproliferation of SKOV3 cells, and VP-16-induced repopulation effects were partially reversed by the FAK inhibitor PF562271. Furthermore, the plasma AA-to-PGE 2 ratio and tumoral FAK expression of ovarian cancer patients after chemotherapy were significantly lower than those before chemotherapy. Taken together, our results indicate that chemotherapy-induced apoptotic cancer cells can produce PGE2-enriched microenvironment through caspase 3-mediated AA metabolic pathway, which could lead to the abnormal activation of FAK and eventually accelerate the repopulation of SKOV3 cells. Our study provides novel insight into a mechanism that may be utilized to prevent ovarian cancer recurrence in response to chemotherapy. © 2017 Cui et al.","Apoptosis; Chemotherapy; FAK; Ovarian cancer; Repopulation",Article,Scopus

However, most studies have found a decreased risk for premenopausal breast cancer. This study was conducted to find out the different effects of BMI on the risk of breast cancer among premenopausal and postmenopausal women, and explore the potential factors that influence the associations.METHODS: A dose-response meta-analysis with 3,318,796 participants from 31 articles was conducted. Cohort studies that included BMI and corresponding breast cancer risk were selected through various databases including PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Chinese Scientific Journals (VIP). Random effects models were used for analyzing the data.RESULTS: The summary relative risks (RRs) were 1.33 (95%CI: 1.20-1.48) and 0.94(95%CI: 0.80-1.11) among postmenopausal and premenopausal women, respectively. The dose-response meta-analysis indicated a positive non-linear association between BMI and breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women, and compared to the mean level of the normal BMI category (21.5 kg/m2) the RR in total postmenopausal women were1.03 (95% CI: 1.02-1.05) per 1 kg/m2 increment. However, no statistically significant association among total premenopausal women was detected. In subgroup analysis among European premenopausal women, the summary RR was 0.79(95%CI: 0.70-0.88). The non-linear relationship showed a negative non-linear association between BMI and breast cancer risk among European premenopausal women. When compared to the mean level of the normal BMI category, the RRs were 0.98 (95%CI: 0.96-1.00) per 1 kg/m2 increment, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: In line with previous studies BMI had different effects on pre-menopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer risk. However, contrary to previous studies, a high BMI was not associated with decreased risk in total pre-menopausal women. More research is needed to better understand these differences.","Body mass index (BMI); Breast cancer; Cohort study; Dose-response relationship; Meta-analysis",Article,Scopus

In this study, we explored the expression and function of PSAT1 in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer.METHOD: The expression level of PSAT1 in breast cancer tissues and cells was analyzed using real-time-PCR (RT-PCR), TCGA datasets or immunohistochemistry (IHC). The overall survival of patients with ER-negative breast cancer stratified by the PSAT1 expression levels was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The function of PSAT1 was analyzed using a series of in vitro assays. Moreover, a nude mouse model was used to evaluate the function of PSAT1 in vivo. qRT-PCR and western blot assays were used to evaluate gene and protein expression, respectively, in the indicated cells. In addition, we demonstrated that PSAT1 was activated by ATF4 by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays.RESULTS: mRNA expression of PSAT1 was up-regulated in ER-negative breast cancer. A tissue microarray that included 297 specimens of ER-negative breast cancer was subjected to an immunohistochemistry assay, which demonstrated that PSAT1 was overexpressed and predicted a poor clinical outcome of patients with this disease. Our data showed that PSAT1 promoted cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. We further found that PSAT1 induced up-regulation of cyclin D1 via the GSK3β/β-catenin pathway, which eventually led to the acceleration of cell cycle progression. Furthermore, ATF4 was also overexpressed in ER-negative breast cancers, and a positive correlation between the ATF4 and PSAT1 mRNA levels was observed in ER-negative breast cancers. We further demonstrated that knockdown of ATF4 by siRNA reduced PSAT1 expression. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that PSAT1 was a target of ATF4.CONCLUSIONS: PSAT1, which is overexpressed in ER-negative breast cancers, is activated by ATF4 and promotes cell cycle progression via regulation of the GSK3β/β-catenin/cyclin D1 pathway.","ATF4; Cell cycle; Estrogen receptor (ER); GSK3β/β-catenin/cyclin D1 pathway; PSAT1",Article,Scopus

Interestingly, metastasis is a result of stroma-coordinated hallmarks such as invasion and migration of the tumor cells from the primary niche, regrowth of the invading tumor cells in the distant organs, proliferation, vascularization, and immune suppression. Targeted therapies, when used as monotherapies or combination therapies, have shown limited success in decreasing the established metastatic growth and improving survival. Thus, novel therapeutic targets are warranted to improve the metastasis outcomes. We have been actively investigating the cytochrome P450 4 (CYP4) family of enzymes that can biosynthesize 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), an important signaling eicosanoid involved in the regulation of vascular tone and angiogenesis. We have shown that 20-HETE can activate several intracellular protein kinases, pro-inflammatory mediators, and chemokines in cancer. This review article is focused on understanding the role of the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway in BC metastasis with an emphasis on 20-HETE as a novel therapeutic target to decrease BC metastasis. We have discussed all the significant investigational mechanisms and put forward studies showing how 20-HETE can promote angiogenesis and metastasis, and how its inhibition could affect the metastatic niches. Potential adjuvant therapies targeting the tumor microenvironment showing anti-tumor properties against BC and its lung metastasis are discussed at the end. This review will highlight the importance of exploring tumor-inherent and stromal-inherent metabolic pathways in the development of novel therapeutics for treating BC metastasis. © 2017 by the authors.

Although the characterisation of somatic mutations is the primary aim of tumour profiling for treatment, germline mutations may also be detected given the heterogenous origin of mutations observed in tumours. Guidance documents address the return of germline findings that have health implications for patients and their genetic relations. However, the implications of discovering a potential but unconfirmed germline finding from tumour profiling are yet to be fully explored. Moreover, as tumour profiling is increasingly applied in oncology, robust ethical frameworks are required to encourage large-scale data sharing and data aggregation linking molecular data to clinical outcomes, to further understand the role of genetics in oncogenesis and to develop improved cancer therapies. Results: This paper reports on the results of empirical research that is broadly aimed at developing an ethical framework for obtaining informed consent to return results from tumour profiling tests and to share the biomolecular data sourced from tumour tissues of cancer patients. Specifically, qualitative data were gathered from 36 semi-structured interviews with cancer patients and oncology clinicians at a cancer treatment centre in Singapore. The interview data indicated that patients had a limited comprehension of cancer genetics and implications of tumour testing. Furthermore, oncology clinicians stated that they lacked the time to provide in depth explanations of the tumour profile tests. However, it was accepted from both patients and oncologist that the return potential germline variants and the sharing of de-identified tumour profiling data nationally and internationally should be discussed and provided as an option during the consent process. Conclusions: Findings provide support for the return of tumour profiling results provided that they are accompanied with an adequate explanation from qualified personnel. They also support the use of broad consent regiments within an ethical framework that promotes trust and benefit sharing with stakeholders and provides accountability and transparency in the storage and sharing of biomolecular data for research. © 2017 The Author(s).","Genomic data sharing; Germline mutations; Informed consent; Tumour profiling",Article,Scopus

Nevertheless, in the past decade, the field of cancer immunotherapy has witnessed remarkable advances for the treatment of a number of malignancies including metastatic melanoma. Although the earliest observations of an immunological antitumor response were made nearly a century ago, it was only in the past 30 years, that immunotherapy emerged as a viable therapeutic option, in particular for cutaneous melanoma. As such, melanoma remains the focus of various preclinical and clinical studies to understand the immunobiology of cancer and to test various tumor immunotherapies. Here, we review key recent developments in the field of immune-mediated therapy of melanoma. Our primary focus is on therapies that have received regulatory approval. Thus, a brief overview of the pathophysiology of melanoma is provided. The purported functions of various tumor-infiltrating immune cell subsets are described, in particular the recently described roles of intratumoral dendritic cells. The section on immunotherapies focuses on strategies that have proved to be the most clinically successful such as immune checkpoint blockade. Prospects for novel therapeutics and the potential for combinatorial approaches are delineated. Finally, we briefly discuss nanotechnology-based platforms which can in theory, activate multiple arms of immune system to fight cancer. The promising advances in the field of immunotherapy signal the dawn of a new era in cancer treatment and warrant further investigation to understand the opportunities and barriers for future progress. © 2017 Sadozai, Gruber, Hunger and Schenk.","Adoptive T cell transfer; Immune checkpoint blockade; Immunotherapy; Melanoma; Programmed cell death protein 1; Tumor microenvironment; Tumor-infiltrating dendritic cell; Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte",Review,Scopus

Materials and methods: We reviewed our experiences from 2010 to 2015 and compared 40 patients with P-ILC, 126 patients with classic-ILC (C-ILC) and 574 cases of high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma (HG-IDC). We studied the histologic and immunohistochemical features, clinical presentation and surgical treatment. Results: P-ILC is diagnosed at the same age and tumor diameter as those of the other two histologic types. It is associated more frequently with multiple lymph node metastases and high proliferative index, and HER2/neu is amplified in 10% of cases. In spite of sharing some histologic characteristics with C-ILC (same growth pattern, loss of E-cadherin expression, same genetic pathway), its clinical and pathologic features define an autonomous entity.

The FDA approval of Bevacizumab in 2004 inspired many scientists to develop more inhibitors of angiogenesis. Although several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are being administered to successfully combat various pathologies, the complexity and large size of mAbs seem to narrow the therapeutic applications. To improve the performance of cancer therapeutics, including those blocking tumor angiogenesis, attractive strategies such as miniaturization of the antibodies have been introduced. Nanobodies (Nbs), small single-domain antigen-binding antibody fragments, are becoming promising therapeutic and diagnostic proteins in oncology due to their favorable unique structural and functional properties. This review focuses on the potential and state of the art of Nbs to inhibit the angiogenic process for therapy and the use of labeled Nbs for non-invasive in vivo imaging of the tumors. © 2017 Arezumand, Alibakhshi, Ranjbari, Ramazani and Muyldermans.","Angiogenesis; Cancer therapy; Monoclonal antibody; Nanobody; Vascular endothelial growth factor family",Review,Scopus

However, the effectiveness of PDT is limited by the fact that tumor hypoxia causes an inadequate O2 supply, and the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells consumes reactive oxygen species. Herein, a multifunctional hybrid system is developed for selective and highly efficient PDT as well as gene-silencing therapy using a novel GSH-activatable and O2/Mn2+-evolving nanocomposite (GAOME NC). This system consists of honeycomb MnO2 (hMnO2) nanocarrier loaded with catalase, Ce6, and DNAzyme with folate label, which can specifically deliver payloads into cancer cells. Once endocytosed, hMnO2 carriers are reduced by the overexpressed GSH to Mn2+ ions, resulting in the reduction of GSH level and disintegration of GAOME NC. The released catalases then trigger the breakdown of endogenous H2O2 to generate O2, which is converted by the excited Ce6 into 1O2. The self-sufficiency of O2 and consumption of GSH effectively enhance the PDT efficacy. Moreover, DNAzyme is freed for gene silencing in the presence of self-generated Mn2+ ions as cofactors. The rational synergy of enhanced PDT and gene-silencing therapy remarkably improve the in vitro and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of cancers. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We therefore aimed to evaluate cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination in Nigeria using pragmatic parameter estimates for cost and programme coverage, i.e. realistically achievable in the studied context.METHODS: A microsimulation frame-work was used. The natural history for cervical cancer disease was remodelled from a previous Nigerian model-based study. Costing was based on health providers' perspective. Disability adjusted life years attributable to cervical cancer mortality served as benefit estimate. Suitable policy option was obtained by calculating the incremental costs-effectiveness ratio. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to assess parameter uncertainty. One-way sensitivity analysis was used to explore the robustness of the policy recommendation to key parameters alteration. Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) was calculated to determine the expected opportunity cost associated with choosing the optimal scenario or strategy at the maximum cost-effectiveness threshold.RESULTS: Combination of the current scenario of opportunistic screening and national HPV vaccination programme (CS + NV) was the only cost-effective and robust policy option. However, CS + NV scenario was only cost-effective so far the unit cost of HPV vaccine did not exceed $5. EVPI analysis showed that it may be worthwhile to conduct additional research to inform the decision to adopt CS + NV.CONCLUSIONS: National HPV vaccination combined with opportunist cervical cancer screening is cost-effective in Nigeria. However, adoption of this strategy should depend on its relative efficiency when compared to other competing new vaccines and health interventions.","Cervical cancer; Cost-effectiveness-analysis; Expected value of perfect information (EVPI); Human Papilloma Virus (HPV); Nigeria; Screening; Vaccine",Article,Scopus

Additionally, we employed Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry imaging (MALDI-FTICR-MSI) to evaluate tumor utilization of cellular metabolites.RESULTS: We provide evidence that, in the absence of CCR5, the early events associated with rapid tumor growth in the MMTV-PyMT mouse model of spontaneous breast cancer development, are diminished, as demonstrated by a delay in tumor onset. In tumor transplant studies into immunocompromised mice we identify a direct correlation between reduced tumor proliferation and decreased metabolic activity, specifically associated with tumor expression of CCR5. The reduction in tumorigenesis is accompanied by decreases in glucose uptake, glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) cell surface expression, intracellular ATP and lactate levels, as well as reduced CCL5 production. Using MALDI-FTICR-MS, we show that the rapid early tumor growth of CCR5+/+ triple negative breast cancer cells in vivo is attributable to increased levels of glycolytic intermediates required for anabolic processes, in contrast to the slower growth rate of their corresponding CCR5-/- cells, that exhibit reduced glycolytic metabolism.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CCL5-CCR5 interactions in the tumor microenvironment modulate metabolic events during tumor onset to promote tumorigenesis.","Anabolic metabolism; Breast cancer; CCL5; CCR5; Glycolysis",Article,Scopus

Prepared nanocarriers were stabilized and functionalized via zinc ions incorporated into the chitosan nanoparticle backbone. We took the advantage of high expression of sarcosine in the prostate cancer cells. The prostate cancer targeting was mediated by the AntiSar antibodies decorated surface of the nanocage. Formation of the chitosan nanoparticles was determined using a ninhydrin assay and differential pulse voltammetry. Obtained results showed the strong effect of tripolyphosphine on the nanoparticle formation. The zinc ions affected strong chitosan backbone coiling both in inner and outer chitosan nanoparticle structure. Zinc electrochemical signal depended on the level of the complex formation and the potential shift from -960 to -950 mV. Formed complex is suitable for doxorubicin delivery. It was observed the 20% entrapment efficiency of doxorubicin and strong dependence of drug release after 120 min in the blood environment. The functionality of the designed nanotransporter was proven. The purposed determination showed linear dependence in the concentration range of Anti-sarcosine IgG labeled gold nanoparticles from 0 to 1000 µg/mL and the regression equation was found to be y = 3.8x - 66.7 and R2 = 0.99. Performed ELISA confirmed the ability of Anti-sarcosine IgG labeled chitosan nanoparticles with loaded doxorubicin to bind to the sarcosine molecule. Observed hemolytic activity of the nanotransporter was 40%. Inhibition activity of our proposed nanotransporter was evaluated to be 0% on the experimental model of S. cerevisiae. Anti-sarcosine IgG labeled chitosan nanoparticles, with loaded doxorubicin stabilized by Zn ions, are a perspective type of nanocarrier for targeted drug therapy managed by specific interaction with sarcosine and metallothionein for prostate cancer. © 2017 by the authors.
