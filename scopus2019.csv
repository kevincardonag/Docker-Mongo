Previous reports have shown the effectiveness of BP in treating cancer diseases. However, BP has no targeting capacity towards specific cancer cells. To improve treatment efficiency and reduce the dose of BP used in cancer treatment, targeting-based approaches should be developed. In the present study, we used riboflavin-5′-phosphate (RFMP) immobilized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) as carriers for BP to treat cancer cell lines derived from liver, prostate and breast. These model cancer cells overexpress riboflavin receptors on their cell membrane and are also sensitive to BP treatment. Thus, BP-binding free RFMP on MNPs can be used as probes to target these model cells, whereas BP can be readily released on target cancer cells. Cell viability was twofold lower by using Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs immobilized with BP than that achieved by using free-form BP at a similar amount. Moreover, BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs have no apparent harmful effects on non-target cells. In addition, we evaluated the level of cysteine-aspartic acid protease 3 (caspase 3) in the resultant cell lysate obtained after treatment by BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs to demonstrate that apoptosis is mainly involved in the growth inhibition of target cells. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Biotin-PEG-PCL polymers have been used for targeted drug delivery to cancer, as well as to improve the pharmacokinetics of the drug and reduce its effects. In this study, biotin-conjugated copolymers were fabricated with polymerization of the ring opening method and the properties of copolymer and nanoparticles were investigated using various techniques. The toxicity of artemisinin and its nanoparticles have been investigated on MCF-7 and normal HFF2 cells. The results showed that the encapsulation efficacy of artemisinin in nanoparticles was 45.5 ± 0.41%. The release profile of the drug indicates that the release is slow and controlled and is approximately pH dependent. The results of artemisinin cell culture on human breast cancer cells showed that biotin-PEG-PCL nanoparticles had an inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells and had no toxic effects on HFF2 cells. Anticancer activity in vivo in the 4T1 breast cancer model showed that tumour volumes were decreased up 40 mm3 by ART-loaded micelles and 76 mm3 by free ART, compared to the control group (2150 mm). In vivo results showed that this formulation significantly increases the accumulation of substances in the tumours. Therefore, the molecular formulation of ART-based copolymers can be a desirable process for cancer treatment purposes. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","anticancer; Artemisinin; biotin-PEG-PCL polymers; micelles; target drug delivery",Article,Scopus

However, the findings are heterogeneous. Methods and results: Relevant studies published in databases such as PubMed, Embase database, and Cochrane library were systematically retrieved from inception to August 25th, 2018, regardless of language, by two investigators independently. Afterwards, the maximum adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from the retrieved studies. Finally, 13 cohort studies involving 1,510,763 participants were enrolled into this meta-analysis. No significant relationship was found between oral BPs and the risk of all-cause cancer in osteoporosis (OP) patients among the entire population (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80–1.18; I 2 92.5%). Besides, oral BPs could remarkably reduce the incidence of breast cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.92; I 2 54%) and endometrial cancer (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.96; I 2 0%) in postmenopausal OP females. In addition, oral BPs were also found to evidently reduce the incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancer in OP patients among the entire population (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–0.98; I 2 36.1%). However, oral BPs may lead to increased risk of liver cancer in mixed genders (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03–2.77; I 2 30.7%). Conclusions: Taken together, oral BPs do not increase the risk of incidence of all-cause cancer; instead, they can reduce the incidence of breast, endometrial, and upper gastrointestinal cancers among the postmenopausal OP females. Our analysis stratified by gender suggests that oral BPs may increase the incidence of liver cancer in mixed genders, while no significant association was observed in females. Careful analysis of post-marketing data should be conducted to address the clinical relevance of our results on the putative association of oral BP use and liver cancer suggested by our meta-analysis. © 2018, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.","Bisphosphonates; Cancer; Meta-analysis; Osteoporosis",Review,Scopus

However, it remains unclear how cancer cells migrate in the three-dimensional (3D) matrix of cancer tissues and how CAFs support the cancer invasion. Here we propose a novel mechanism of fibroblast-dependent cancer cell invasion in the 3D collagen matrix. Human cancer cell lines from the pancreas (Panc-1), lung (A549) and some other organs actively adhered to normal fibroblasts and primary lung CAFs in cultures. To show its significance in tumor invasion, we designed a new invasion assay in which homogeneous microspheroids consisting of cancer cells and fibroblasts were embedded into collagen gel. Time-lapse experiments showed that cancer cells adhered to and quickly migrated on the long protrusions of fibroblasts in the 3D collagen matrix. Fibroblast-free cancer cells poorly invaded the matrix. Experiments with function-blocking antibodies, siRNAs, and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that cancer cells adhered to fibroblasts through integrin α5β1-mediated binding to fibronectin on the surface of fibroblasts. Immunochemical analyses of the co-cultures and lung cancers suggested that cancer cells could acquire the migratory force by the fibronectin/integrin signaling. Our results also revealed that the fibroblast-bound fibronectin was a preferential substrate for cancer cells to migrate in the collagen matrix. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

In this study, we discovered that activation of the PERK branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways is required for colon cancer cells to survive treatment of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), one of the first-line chemotherapeutics for late-stage colon cancer patients. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of PERK or its downstream factors greatly sensitize colon cancer cells to 5-FU.

These advances have been made in target selection, vaccine technology, and methods for reversing the immunosuppressive mechanisms exploited by cancers. Studies testing different tumor antigens have revealed target properties that yield high tumor versus normal cell specificity and adequate immunogenicity to affect clinical efficacy. A few tumor-associated antigens, normal host proteins that are abnormally expressed in cancer cells, have been demonstrated to serve as good targets for immunotherapies, although many do not possess the needed specificity or immunogenicity. Neoantigens, which arise from mutated proteins in cancer cells, are truly cancer-specific and can be highly immunogenic, though the vast majority are unique to each patient’s cancer and thus require development of personalized therapies. Lessons from previous cancer vaccine expeditions are teaching us the type and magnitude of immune responses needed, as well as vaccine technologies that can achieve these responses. For example, we are learning which vaccine approaches elicit the potent, balanced, and durable CD4 plus CD8 T cell expansion necessary for clinical efficacy. Exploration of interactions between the immune system and cancer has elucidated the adaptations that enable cancer cells to suppress and evade immune attack. This has led to breakthroughs in the development of new drugs, and, subsequently, to opportunities to combine these with cancer vaccines and dramatically increase patient responses.

In this large, prospective cohort study of women, consumption of brown cheese was suggestively protective against colon cancer. However, adjustment attenuated the inverse risk association.

Current cancer diagnosis utilizes histopathology, which requires tissue acquisition, extensive processing and, in most cases, relies on the qualitative morphological analysis of tissues and cells. Molecular biomarkers are only available for a few specific tumor subtypes. We discovered that the fluorescence polarization (Fpol) of Methylene Blue (MB) is significantly higher in cancer than in normal human breast tissues and cells. We confirmed that fluorescence polarization imaging did not affect the viability of the cells and yielded highly significant differences between cancer and normal cells using MB concentrations as low as 0.05 and 0.01 mg/ml. To explain this phenomenon we examined intracellular localization of MB and its fluorescence lifetime. We determined that higher fluorescence polarization of MB occurs due to its increased accumulation in mitochondria of cancer cells, as well as shorter fluorescence lifetime in cancer relative to normal cells. As quantitative MB Fpol imaging can be performed in vivo and in real time, it holds the potential to provide an accurate quantitative marker of cancer at the cellular level. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

We present a fundamentally different approach for identifying the cause of individual instances of cancer: we search for combinations of genes with carcinogenic mutations (multi-hit combinations) instead of individual driver genes or mutations. We developed an algorithm that identified a set of multi-hit combinations that differentiate between tumor and normal tissue samples with 91% sensitivity (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 89–92%) and 93% specificity (95% CI = 91–94%) on average for seventeen cancer types.

The sub-network of colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers were constructed from human protein–protein interaction network. The potential genes were analyzed using hubs and centrality measures. For the identification of target genes, we retrieve those genes that had the highest score in both mutation rates and graph centrality. Moreover, gene deletion analysis revealed that MYC, TP53, and EGFR genes remained potential targets in colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer respectively.

Since epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in promoting metastasis of cancer, many mechanisms regarding EMT have been studied. We previously showed that Ribonucleic acid export 1 (RAE1) is dysregulated in breast cancer and its overexpression leads to aggressive breast cancer phenotypes by inducing EMT. Here, we evaluated the functional capacity of RAE1 in breast cancer metastasis by using a three-dimensional (3D) culture system and xenograft models. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanisms of RAE1-driven EMT, in vitro studies were carried out. The induction of EMT with RAE1-overexpression was confirmed under the 3D culture system and in vivo system. Importantly, RAE1 mediates upregulation of an EMT marker ZEB1, by binding to the promoter region of ZEB1. Knockdown of ZEB1 in RAE1-overexpressing cells suppressed invasive and migratory behaviors, accompanied by an increase in epithelial and a decrease in mesenchymal markers. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RAE1 contributes to breast cancer metastasis by regulating a key EMT-inducing factor ZEB1 expression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

However, the underlying mechanisms of how it is implicated in cancer metastasis is not yet fully understood. Here, we used two pancreatic cancer cell lines and an established in vitro system to study the effect of solid stress-induced signal transduction on pancreatic cancer cell migration as well as the mechanism involved. Our results show that the migratory ability of cells increases as a direct response to solid stress. We also found that Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) expression and secretion is strongly upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells in response to mechanical compression. Performing a phosphoprotein screening, we identified that solid stress activates the Akt/CREB1 pathway to transcriptionally regulate GDF15 expression, which eventually promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration.

Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common malignant tumor of the female genital tract in Western countries. EC patients are divided into risk categories based on histopathological tumor type, grade, and myometrial invasion depth. EC is surgically staged using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system. Since FIGO (2009) stage correlates with prognosis, preoperative staging is essential for tailored treatment. MRI reveals myometrial invasion depth, which correlates with tumor grade and lymph node metastases, and thus correlates with prognosis. Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death among females in developing countries. The FIGO Gynecologic Oncology Committee recently revised its CC staging guidelines, allowing staging based on imaging and pathological findings when available. The revised FIGO (2018) staging includes node involvement and thus enables both therapy selection and evaluation, prognosis estimation, and calculation of end results. MRI can accurately assess prognostic indicators, e.g., tumor size, parametrial invasion, pelvic sidewall, and lymph node invasion. Despite these important roles of MRI, radiologists still face challenges due to the technical and interpretation pitfalls of MRI during all phases of endometrial and cervical cancer evaluation. Awareness of mimics that can simulate both cancers is critical. With careful application, functional MRI with DWI and DCE sequences can help establish a correct diagnosis, although it is sometimes necessary to perform biopsy and histopathological analysis. © 2019, The Author(s).","Cervical cancer; Diffusion; Endometrial cancer; Lymph nodes; Magnetic resonance",Review,Scopus

In this study, we further investigated the antitumor effect of X-NP-DOX NP delivery system using low-dose DOX in both in vitro and in vivo systems. We demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX possessed the ability for inhibiting MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth, invasion, and migration, and inducing apoptosis in vitro. In in vivo experiments, injection of low-dose X-NP-DOX into tumor-bearing mouse resulted in significant reduction of tumor size. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining further revealed that low-dose X-NP-DOX induced higher percentage of apoptotic cells compared with free DOX or saline. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that low-dose X-NP-DOX inhibited Notch1 and Ras/MAPK pathways, decreased cancer stem cell population, and reduced tumorigenesis compared to free DOX in both in vitro and in vivo settings.

The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

In this study, 1 h of hyperthermia at 42 °C increased the mitROS production, and both the accumulation of cancer-specific porphyrins and the PDT cytotoxicity increased. Moreover, the authors treated cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to examine the effect of mitROS. NAC inhibited the increasing ROS production after hyperthermia to restrain the post-treatment increase of cancer-specific porphyrins accumulation. Moreover, the increase of ROS production in cancer cells after hyperthermia upregulated HCP-1 expression and downregulated ABCG2 expression. These regulation were inhibited by NAC. These results suggest that hyperthermia treatment increased mitROS production, which involved HpD accumulation and enhanced PDT effects in cancer cells. The mechanism of this phenomenon was most likely to be due to both the upregulation of HCP-1 and the downregulation of ABCG2 by mitROS. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Accumulative studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is broadly overexpressed in cancers, which contributes to cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a proteasome-dependent downregulation of UHRF1 has been observed in pluripotent ground state mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in the presence of two kinase (MEK1/MEK2 and GSK3β) inhibitors (termed 2i), raising the question whether UHRF1 is similarly regulated in cancer cells. Here we present evidence that while addition of 2i broadly downregulates UHRF1 and DNMT1 in various cancer cells, distinct underlying mechanisms are involved. In contrast to mESCs, 2i-induced downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancer cells cannot be rescued by proteasome inhibitor and occurs primarily at the level of transcription. Furthermore, downregulation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by 2i is due to inhibition of MEK1/MEK2, but not GSK3β activity. Data mining reveals a marked co-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in normal tissues as well as cancers. We provide evidence that multiple transcription factors including E2F1 and SP1 mediate the transcriptional activation of UHRF1 and DNMT1 by the activated MEK/ERK pathway. Together our study reveals distinct regulation of UHRF1/DNMT1 in mESCs and cancer cells and identifies activated MEK/ERK pathway as a driving force for coordinated and aberrant over-expression of UHRF1 and DNMT1 in cancers. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Cadaverine treatment of Balb/c female mice (500 nmol/kg p.o. q.d.) grafted with 4T1 breast cancer cells ameliorated the disease (lower mass and infiltration of the primary tumor, fewer metastases, and lower grade tumors). Cadaverine treatment of breast cancer cell lines corresponding to its serum reference range (100–800 nM) reverted endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inhibited cellular movement and invasion, moreover, rendered cells less stem cell-like through reducing mitochondrial oxidation. Trace amino acid receptors (TAARs), namely, TAAR1, TAAR8 and TAAR9 were instrumental in provoking the cadaverine-evoked effects. Early stage breast cancer patients, versus control women, had reduced abundance of the CadA and LdcC genes in fecal DNA, both responsible for bacterial cadaverine production. Moreover, we found low protein expression of E. coli LdcC in the feces of stage 1 breast cancer patients. In addition, higher expression of lysine decarboxylase resulted in a prolonged survival among early-stage breast cancer patients.

Although substantial advances have been obtained both in treatment and survival rates, there is still a need for new therapeutical approaches. Natural compounds are a realistic source of new bioactive compounds with anticancer activity. Among them, rosemary polyphenols have shown a vast antiproliferative capacity against colon cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. We have investigated the antitumor activity of a rosemary extract (RE) obtained by using supercritical fluid extraction through its capacity to inhibit various signatures of cancer progression and metastasis such as proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenic survival. RE strongly inhibited proliferation, migration and colony formation of colon cancer cells regardless their phenotype. Treatment with RE led to a sharp increase of intracellular ROS that resulted in necrosis cell death. Nrf2 gene silencing increased RE cytotoxic effects, thus suggesting that this pathway was involved in cell survival. These in vitro results were in line with a reduction of tumor growth by oral administration of RE in a xenograft model of colon cancer cells using athymic nude mice.

Proper inflammatory responses are necessary for adaptive sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, and fever) and neuroinflammatory pathways are also implicated in mental health disturbances (e.g., cognitive impairment, depression) suffered by cancer patients and survivors. Rodent cancer models indicate that tumors are sufficient to exacerbate neuroinflammatory responses after an immune challenge, however primary tumors are not usually present in cancer survivors, and the behavioral consequences of these brain changes remain understudied. Therefore, we tested the extent to which mammary tumor resection attenuates tumor-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior following an immune challenge (i.p. lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) in mice. Tnf-α, Il-1β, and Il-6 mRNA decreased in multiple brain regions of LPS-treated tumor-bearing mice relative to LPS-treated controls; tumor resection attenuated these effects in some cases (but not Tnf-α). Tumors also attenuated sickness behaviors (hypothermia and lethargy) compared to LPS-treated controls. Tumor resection reversed these behavioral consequences, although basal body temperature remained elevated, comparable to tumor-bearing mice.

The source of this pain is multifaceted and includes factors secreted from tumor cells. Malignant cells release the neurotransmitter and cell-signaling molecule glutamate via the oxidative stress-related cystine/glutamate antiporter, system x C − , which reciprocally imports cystine for synthesis of glutathione and the cystine/cysteine redox cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of system x C − has shown success in reducing and delaying the onset of cancer pain-related behavior in mouse models. This investigation describes the development of a stable siRNA-induced knockdown of the functional trans-membrane system x C − subunit xCT (SLC7A11) in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Clones were verified for xCT knockdown at the transcript, protein, and functional levels.

Endometrial cancers are associated with several critical gene mutations, including PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS. Different gene mutations in endometrial cancer cells have varied responses to anticancer drugs and cancer therapies. The most frequently altered gene in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma tumors is PTEN. PTEN protein has lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activity, as well as other functions in the nucleus. Although the tumor-suppressive function of PTEN has mainly been attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity, a role for PTEN protein phosphatase activity in cell cycle regulation has also been suggested. Various tumor type-specific PTEN mutations are well documented. Here, nine endometrioid endometrial cancer cell lines with PIK3A, PTEN, and KRAS gene mutations were treated with docetaxel and radiation. One mutation with a docetaxel drug-resistant effect was a truncated form of PTEN. Among PTEN mutations in endometrial cancer cells, the Y68 frame shift mutation of PTEN constitutes a major mechanism of resistance to docetaxel treatment.

Especially, combinational chemo and photothermal therapy is of particular interest due to its high flexibility as well as efficiency. In this article, we the silica nanoparticles (SLN) were surface conjugated with Cetuximab (Cet-SLN) to target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a common receptor that usually observed to overexpress in multiple breast cancers. Moreover, the high drug loading capacity of Cet-SLN was employed to encapsulate photothermal agent indocyanine green (ICG) to finally fabricate a versatile drug delivery system (DDS) able to co-deliver Cet and ICG (Cet-SLN/ICG) for combinational chemo-photothermal therapy of breast cancer. The obtained results clearly demonstrated that Cet-SLN/ICG was well-dispersed nanoparticles with preferable stability under physiological condition. Furthermore, due to the conjugation of Cet, Cet-SLN/ICG could target EGFR which overexpress in MCF-7 cells. Most importantly, both in vitro and in vivo results suggested that compared with Cet or ICG alone, the Cet-SLN/ICG showed superior anticancer efficacy. In conclusion, Cet-SLN/ICG could be a potential platform for effective combinational chemo-photothermal therapy for breast cancer.","breast cancer; Cetuximab; chemo-photothermal therapy; indocyanine green; silica nanoparticles",Article,Scopus

Remarkably, reducing the levels of Claspin and Timeless in HCT116 cells to pretumoral levels impeded fork progression without affecting checkpoint signaling. These data indicate that high level of Claspin and Timeless increase RS tolerance by protecting replication forks in cancer cells. Moreover, we report that primary fibroblasts adapt to oncogene-induced RS by spontaneously overexpressing Claspin and Timeless, independently of ATR signaling.

CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as a regulator of immune cell recruitment and function in addition to their tumour-promoting roles. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CAFs on monocyte recruitment and macrophage polarization in breast cancer. CAFs, which were α-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to normal fibroblasts (NFs), effectively recruited monocytes. Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) as well as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) cytokines. CAFs differentiated the recruited monocytes into M2-like macrophages which are capable of exerting their immunosuppressive roles via the PD-1 axis. CAF-educated monocytes exhibited strong immune suppression unlike NF-educated monocytes and enhanced the motility/invasion of breast cancer cells in addition to increasing the expressions of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes and vimentin protein in cancer cells. CAF-educated M1 macrophages displayed increased expression of M2 markers and production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in contrast to decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 compared with control M1 macrophages; suggesting that CAFs were also able to induce the trans-differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. We then investigated the relationship between the infiltration of CAFs and tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) using tissue samples obtained from breast cancer patients. High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in human breast cancer tissue samples. It was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. This result is in line with our finding of increased breast cancer cell proliferation due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes in vitro. Our results concluded that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Historically, their therapeutic benefit is due to ADC targeting of lineage-restricted antigens. The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is attractive for targeted therapy of haematological cancers, given its expression in multiple tumour types and role in cancer “homing” to bone marrow. However, CXCR4 is also expressed in haematopoietic cells and other normal tissues, raising safety challenges to the development of anti-CXCR4 ADCs for cancer treatment. Here, we designed the first anti-CXCR4 ADC with favourable therapeutic index, effective in xenografts of haematopoietic cancers resistant to standard of care and anti-CXCR4 antibodies. We screened multiple ADC configurations, by varying type of linker-payload, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), affinity and Fc format. The optimal ADC bears a non-cleavable linker, auristatin as payload at DAR = 4 and a low affinity antibody with effector–reduced Fc. Contrary to other drugs targeting CXCR4, anti-CXCR4 ADCs effectively eliminated cancer cells as monotherapy, while minimizing leucocytosis. The optimal ADC selectively eliminated CXCR4 + cancer cells in solid tumours, but showed limited toxicity to normal CXCR4 + tissues, sparing haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Our work provides proof-of-concept that through empirical ADC design, it is possible to target proteins with broad normal tissue expression. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Lymph node metastasis arises at a very early stage in some patients. Using the data downloaded from the TCGA database, we studied the differences between primary tumors with and without lymph node metastasis at the multi-omics level using bioinformatics approaches. Our study found that low mutation and neoantigen burdens correlated with lymph node metastazation of breast cancer. All three conserved domains in TP53 were mutated in lymph node-negative breast cancers, whereas only one domain was mutated in lymph node-positive samples. Mutations in microtubule-related proteins appear to help immune cells recognize tumors and inhibit their lymph node metastasis. Destroying microtubule-related proteins is a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. As the neoantigens specifically present in lymph node-positive breast cancers, MAPK10, BC9L, TRIM65, CD93, KITLG, CNPPD1, CPED1, CCDC146, TMEM185A, INO80D, and PSMD11 are potential targets for vaccine design.

Thus, it is critically important to diagnose cancer cachexia early. To provide background data for the diagnosis of cachexia, cancer cachectic factors were characterized in the present situation, including immunological cachectic changes during cachexia progression in a cancer cachexia mouse model. Major constitution of cachexia progression is known as the stages of pre-cachexia, cachexia, and refractory cachexia. In the pre-cachexia stage, the weights of immune-related organs, including the thymus and spleen were significantly. T cell populations in spleen were markedly reduced and cachectic cytokines consistently increased in a time-dependent manner. Immunosuppression by activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 was induced earlier in CD4 + cells versus other T cell populations. Furthermore, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin-6 levels in the cachexia group were significantly increased at 3 days from C26 cell inoculation whereas significant carcass weight loss as a classical diagnostic marker occurred at 9 days from C26 cell inoculation. In conclusion, the initiation of cachectic immunological changes was observed prior to weight loss, during the pre-cachexia stage. Accordingly, these findings reveal that the monitoring of humoral and immunological factors may be more sensitive than weight loss for the initial diagnosis and treatment of cachexia. © 2019, The Author(s).","C26 tumor-bearing mice; Cancer cachexia; CD4 + T cell; Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4; Immunosuppression; Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1",Article,Scopus

The TCGA consortium has mapped DNA methylation in thousands of cancer samples using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip (Illumina 450 K array) that only covers about 1.5% of CpGs in the human genome. Therefore, increasing the coverage of the DNA methylome would significantly leverage the usage of the TCGA data. Here, we present a new model called EAGLING that can expand the Illumina 450 K array data 18 times to cover about 30% of the CpGs in the human genome. We applied it to analyze 13 cancers in TCGA. By integrating the expanded methylation, gene expression, and somatic mutation data, we identified the genes showing differential patterns in each of the 13 cancers. Many of the triple-evidenced genes identified in majority of the cancers are biomarkers or potential biomarkers. Pan-cancer analysis also revealed the pathways in which the triple-evidenced genes are enriched, which include well known ones as well as new ones, such as axonal guidance signaling pathway and pathways related to inflammatory processing or inflammation response. Triple-evidenced genes, particularly TNXB, RRM2, CELSR3, SLC16A3, FANCI, MMP9, MMP11, SIK1, and TRIM59 showed superior predictive power in both tumor diagnosis and prognosis.

This study was designed to investigate the potential anti-cancer effects of SPG-56, which consists of 2.9% sugar and 97.1% protein. The effects of SPG-56 on the proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were determined using CCK-8 and Hoechst 33342 assays and flow cytometry, after staining with Annexin V and PI respectively. The activities of SPG-56 against breast cancer were examined using female BALB/c nude mice orthotopically implanted with human breast carcinoma cells of the types MCF-7 and 4T1-Luc. The cellular experiments showed that SPG-56 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of MCF-7 cells dose- and time-dependently. Oral administration of SPG-56 significantly suppressed the development of MCF-7 tumor cells (P < 0.01) as compared with an untreated group. The serum tumor markers CEA, CA125 and CA153 in a 240 mg/kg/d SPG-56 decreased by 54.8%, 91.8%, and 90.3%, respectively. The experiments further demonstrated that SPG-56 inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer in MCF-7 and 4T1-bearing mice by altering the expression of MMP2, MMP9, VEGF, Occludin and Claudin.

However, macrophages make up a majority of immune cell infiltrates into tumors, creating natural targets for immunotherapies able to direct macrophages away from tumor-supportive functions and toward anti-tumor phenotypes. Recent studies demonstrate that toll-like receptors (TLRs) – pathways that quickly trigger early immune responses – play an important role in polarizing macrophages. Here, we present emerging ways in which TLR signaling is being manipulated in macrophages to create new opportunities for cancer immunotherapy. In particular, we discuss approaches to deliver TLR agonists, to leverage biomaterials in these therapies, and to couple TLR-based approaches with other frontline treatments as combination cancer therapies. © 2019",,Review,Scopus

In this respect, expression of the pro-phagocytic signal SLAMF7 on both macrophages and cancer cells was recently reported to be a requisite for CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that in fact SLAMF7 expression on cancer cells is not required and does not impact on CD47 antibody therapy.

Three healthy ocular cell lines (corneal, lens, and retinal epithelial cells) and a cancer cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells) were exposed to liquid and gas phase emissions from applewood and coal combustion. Following the exposure, real-time cell attachment behavior was monitored for at least 120 hours with electrical cell impedance spectroscopy. The viability of the cells, amount of apoptotic cells, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified with MTT, ApoTox-Glo, and ROS-Glo H 2 O 2 assays, respectively. The results showed that coal emissions compromised the viability of ocular cells more than applewood emissions. Interestingly, the cancer cells, although their viability was not compromised, generated 1.7 to 2.7 times more ROS than healthy cells.

However, this classical interpretation intrinsically represents an approximation since, as in all tissues, cancer G6Pase activity is remarkable and is confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whose lumen must be reached by phosphorylated FDG to explain its hydrolysis and radioactivity release. The present study tested the impact of G6Pase sequestration on the mathematical description of FDG trafficking and handling in cultured cancer cells.

Our data indicates that the cytotoxicity of La 3+ -B-α-LA against cancer cells is through apoptotic path way. The higher anticancer activity of La 3+ -B-α-LA is attributable to the requisite structural changes induced in the protein by La 3+ binding as supported by the crystal structure of the complex. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

One of the emerging techniques with tremendous power for lung cancer therapy is magnetic aerosol drug targeting (MADT). The use of a permanent magnet for effective drug delivery in a desired location throughout the lung requires extensive optimization, but it has not been addressed yet. In the present study, the possibility of using a permanent magnet for trapping the particles on a lung tumor is evaluated numerically in the Weibel's model from G0 to G3. The effect of different parameters is considered on the efficiency of particle deposition in a tumor located on a distant position of the lung bronchi and bronchioles. Also, the effective position of the magnetic source, tumor size, and location are the objectives for particle deposition. The results show that a limited particle deposition occurs on the lung branches in passive targeting. However, the incorporation of a permanent magnet next to the tumor enhanced the particle deposition fraction on G2 to up to 49% for the particles of 7 µm diameter. Optimizing the magnet size could also improve the particle deposition fraction by 68%. It was also shown that the utilization of MADT is essential for effective drug delivery to the tumors located on the lower wall of airway branches given the dominance of the air velocity and resultant drag force in this region. The results demonstrated the high competence and necessity of MADT as a noninvasive drug delivery method for lung cancer therapy.","aerosol drug targeting; bronchial tumor; computational fluid dynamics (CFD); Lung cancer; permanents magnet",Article,Scopus

Specific genes and functional pathways distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines are identified by contrasting signatures obtained at extreme and median GI50 thresholds. Ensembles of gene signatures at different thresholds are combined to reduce the dependence on specific GI50 values for predicting drug responses. The most accurate gene signatures for each platin are: cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, and TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, and VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1.

Adjuvant chemotherapy has significantly reduced mortality but increased cognitive impairments, including attention function, making quality of life issues a crucial concern. This study enrolled nineteen breast cancer patients who were treated with standard chemotherapy within 6 months and 20 sex-matched healthy controls to investigate the brain effects of chemotherapy. All participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mfALFF) analysis and were correlated with neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R), and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to explore the possible underlying mechanism of cognitive alternations. We found increased mfALFF over the frontoparietal lobe and decreased mfALFF over the occipital lobe in the cancer patients compared with the healthy controls; the altered brain regions may be associated with the dorsal attention network (DAN) and may be explained by a compensatory mechanism. Both MMSE and CAMS-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the occipital lobe but a negative correlation in the frontoparietal lobe. By contrast, IES-R scores showed a positive correlation with mfALFF in the frontoparietal lobe but a negative correlation in the occipital lobe.

A new data integrative approach, based on graphical models, was applied on our multi-modal –omics, and clinical data cohort of metastatic melanoma patients. We found that response to chemotherapy is directly linked to ten gene expression, four methylation variables and PARP1 SNP rs1805407. PARP1 is a DNA repair gene critical for chemotherapy response and for which FDA-approved inhibitors are clinically available (olaparib). We demonstrated that two PARP inhibitors (ABT-888 and olaparib) make SNP carrier cancer cells of various histologic subtypes more sensitive to alkylating agents, but they have no effect in wild-type cells. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitors act synergistically with chemotherapy in SNP carrier cells (especially in ovarian cancer for which olaparib is FDA-approved), but they are additive at best in wild-type cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of chemotherapy and PARP1 inhibition may benefit the carriers of rs1805407 in the future and may be used in personalized therapy strategies to select patients that are more likely to respond to PARP inhibitors. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

High-throughput sequencing showed that the diversity and richness indexes were significantly decreased in ovarian cancer tissues compared to tissues from normal distal fallopian tubes. The ratio of the two phyla for Proteobacteria/Firmicutes was notably increased in ovarian cancer, which revealed that microbial composition change might be associated with the process of ovarian cancer development.

Macrophage-targeted inhibition of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) by immunotherapy was confirmed to inhibit macrophage accumulation and slow mammary tumor growth in mouse models while also reducing hemosiderin iron-laden TAM accumulation as measured by both iron histology and in vivo iron MRI (FeMRI). Spatial profiling of TAM iron deposit infiltration defined regions of maximal accumulation and response to the CSF1R inhibitor, and revealed differences between microenvironments of human cancer according to levels of polarized macrophage iron accumulation in stromal margins.

Analysis of AA-reconstructed amplicons in a pan-cancer dataset reveals many novel properties of copy number amplifications in cancer. These findings support a model in which focal amplifications arise due to the formation and replication of extrachromosomal DNA. Applying AA to 68 viral-mediated cancer samples, we identify a large fraction of amplicons with specific structural signatures suggestive of hybrid, human-viral extrachromosomal DNA.

It is the most common cancer diagnosed among women worldwide and is often treated with tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is catalysed by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), and inter-individual variations in the enzyme due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could alter enzyme activity. We evaluated SNPs in patients from Colombia in South America who were receiving tamoxifen treatment for breast cancer. Allelic diversity in the CYP2D6 gene was found in the studied population, with two patients displaying the poor-metaboliser phenotype. Molecular dynamics and trajectory analyses were performed for CYP2D6 from these two patients, comparing it with the common allelic form (CYP2D6*1). Although we found no significant structural change in the protein, its dynamics differ significantly from those of CYP2D6*1, the effect of such differential dynamics resulting in an inefficient enzyme with serious implications for tamoxifen-treated patients, increasing the risk of disease relapse and ineffective treatment. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Recurrent mutations in noncoding regions affecting gene regulatory elements and structural variations (SVs) leading to gene disruptions are prevalent. Notably, we find recurrent ADGRG6 enhancer mutations and FRS2 duplications which are associated with higher protein expression in the tumor and poor prognosis. Functional assays demonstrate that depletion of ADGRG6 or FRS2 expression in UBC cells compromise their abilities to recruit endothelial cells and induce tube formation.

PARPs play an indispensable role in DNA damage repair and small molecule PARP inhibitors have emerged as potent anticancer drugs. However, to date, PARP inhibitor treatment has been restricted to patients with BRCA1/2 mutation-associated breast and ovarian cancer. One of the major challenges to extend the therapeutic potential of PARP inhibitors to other cancer types is the absence of predictive biomarkers. Here, we show that ovarian cancer cells with higher level of NADP + , an NAD + derivative, are more sensitive to PARP inhibitors. We demonstrate that NADP + acts as a negative regulator and suppresses ADP-ribosylation both in vitro and in vivo. NADP + impairs ADP-ribosylation-dependent DNA damage repair and sensitizes tumor cell to chemically synthesized PARP inhibitors.

Although much emphasis has been placed in recent years in designing drugs and inhibitors targeting EZH2, less effort has been given in exploring its existing targets that will help in understanding the oncogenic role of EZH2 in turn which may provide a more stringent method of targeting EZH2. In the present study, we validated six direct targets of EZH2 that are GPNMB, PMEPA1, CoL5A1, VGLL4, POMT2 and SUMF1 associated with cancer related pathways. Upon EZH2 knockdown, more than two fold increase in the target gene expression was evident. CHIP-qPCR performed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MDA-231 confirmed the in-vivo binding of EZH2 on its identified target. Thirty invasive breast carcinoma cases with their adjacent normal tissues were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry in primary breast tumor tissue array showed tumor dependent expression of EZH2. Array of MERAV expression database revealed the strength of association of EZH2 with its target genes. Real time PCR performed with RNA extracted from breast tumor tissues further authenticated the existing negative correlation between EZH2 and its target genes. Pearson correlation coefficient & statistical significance computed using the matrix provided in the database strengthened the negative correlation between identified target genes and EZH2. KM plotter analysis showed improved relapse-free survival with increased expression of PMEPA1, POMT2, VGLL4 and SUMF1 in breast cancer patients indicating their therapeutic potential.

We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer.

These dimensions are then correlated with phenotype variables.

It proved superior to the single-gene and alternative enrichment analyses in terms of (1) universal applicability to different data types with a possibility of cross-platform integration, (2) consistency of the discovered correlates between independent drug screens, and (3) ability to explain differential survival of treated patients.

MTH1 dephosphorylates oxidized nucleotides, thereby preventing their incorporation into DNA and protecting tumour cells from oxidative DNA damage. Inhibitors of MTH1 (TH588 and (S)-crizotinib) were shown to reduce cancer cell viability. However, the MTH1-dependency of the anti-cancer effects of these drugs has recently been questioned. Here, we have assessed anti-tumour effects of TH588 and (S)-crizotinib in patient-derived 3D colorectal cancer cultures. Hypoxia and reoxygenation – conditions that increase intracellular ROS levels – increased sensitivity to (S)-crizotinib, but not to TH588. (S)-crizotinib reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET and ErbB3 whereas TH588 induced a mitotic cell cycle arrest, which was not affected by adding ROS-modulating compounds. Furthermore, we show that both compounds induced DNA damage that could not be prevented by adding the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Moreover, adding ROS-modulating compounds did not alter the reduction in viability in response to TH588 and (S)-crizotinib. We conclude that TH588 and (S)-crizotinib have very clear and distinct anti-tumour effects in 3D colorectal cancer cultures, but that these effects most likely occur through distinct and ROS-independent mechanisms. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

SPIONs entrapped in the core of the nanocomplex may act as a hyperthermia agent and generate localized heat upon excitation with an alternating magnetic field (AMF), thus enabling a thermo-chemotherapy strategy for cancer treatment. Accordingly, the cytotoxic effect and the mode of cell death triggered by the nanocomplex in combination with AMF were evaluated on two different cancer cell lines with various folate receptor (FR) expression levels, including KB nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing FRs as the model and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with low level of FRs as the blank sample. The obtained results showed that KB cell death was greater than the cell death observed in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, a majority of cell death in both cell lines were related to apoptosis when the folate-modified nanocomplex was used instated of the non-folate-modified nanocomplex.

However, loss of the bioactive components of Huaier during the extraction procedure with water is unavoidable, and the underlying mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of Huaier remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effect of Huaier n-butanol extract, which contained 51.4% total flavonoids, on HGC27, MGC803, and AGS human GC cell lines in vitro. At a low concentration, Huaier n-butanol extract inhibited the growth of these GC cell types, induced cell cycle arrest and reduced cell metastasis. Moreover, Huaier n-butanol extract suppressed the c-Myc-Bmi1 signalling pathway, and overexpression of Bmi1 reversed the effects of Huaier n-butanol extract on GC cells. Thus, our findings indicate that Huaier n-butanol extract suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells via a c-Myc-Bmi1-mediated approach, providing a new perspective for our understanding of the anti-tumour effects of Huaier.

For this purpose, we investigated the anti-tumoral effect of thirteen phenolic compounds, from the Tunisian quince Cydonia oblonga Miller, alone or combined to 5-FU, on the human 5-FU-resistant LS174-R colon cancer cells in comparison to parental cells. Our results showed that only Kaempferol was able to chemo-sensitize 5-FU-resistant LS174-R cells. This phenolic compound combined with 5-FU exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on cell viability. This combination enhanced the apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest of both chemo-resistant and sensitive cells through impacting the expression levels of different cellular effectors. Kaempferol also blocked the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulated the expression of JAK/STAT3, MAPK, PI3K/AKT and NF-κB. In silico docking analysis suggested that the potent anti-tumoral effect of Kaempferol, compared to its two analogs (Kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and Kampferol 3-O-rutinoside), can be explained by the absence of glucosyl groups.

Due to their mitochondrial dysfunction, TOP1MT-KO cells become addicted to glycolysis, which limits synthetic building blocks and energy supply required for the proliferation of cancer cells in a nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment.

Here we show that stromal expression of Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) is associated with aggressive breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers. We demonstrate that DKK3 is a HSF1 effector that modulates the pro-tumorigenic behaviour of CAFs in vitro and in vivo. DKK3 orchestrates a concomitant activation of β-catenin and YAP/TAZ. Whereas β-catenin is dispensable for CAF-mediated ECM remodelling, cancer cell growth and invasion, DKK3-driven YAP/TAZ activation is required to induce tumour-promoting phenotypes. Mechanistically, DKK3 in CAFs acts via canonical Wnt signalling by interfering with the negative regulator Kremen and increasing cell-surface levels of LRP6.

Experiment in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated up-regulation of PKD2 led to high expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vim, mmp9 et al.) and EMT transcription factors(zeb1, twist, snail), and the results were reversed when PKD2 was knocked down. Further investigation showed that abrogation of PKD2 inhibited A549 cell migration, invasion, proliferation and induced cell arrest in G2/M phase. We concluded that high expression of PKD2 was associated with poor prognosis and cancer progression in lung adenocarcinoma patients by promoting EMT. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Elephants have a lower incidence of cancer suggesting that these animals have probably evolved different ways to protect themselves against the disease. The paradox is worth revisiting with the realization that most mammals encode an endogenous APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase capable of mutating single stranded DNA. Indeed, the mutagenic activity of some APOBEC3 enzymes has been shown to introduce somatic mutations into genomic DNA. These enzymes are now recognized as causal agent responsible for the accumulation of CG- > TA transitions and DNA breaks leading to chromosomal rearrangements in human cancer genomes. Here, we identified an elephant A3Z1 gene, related to human APOBEC3A and showed that it could efficiently deaminate cytidine, 5-methylcytidine and produce DNA breaks leading to massive apoptosis, similar to other mammalian APOBEC3A enzymes where body mass varies by up to four orders of magnitude. Consequently, it could be considered that eAZ1 might contribute to cancer in elephants in a manner similar to their proposed role in humans. If so, eAZ1 might be particularly well regulated to counter Peto’s paradox. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

We showed for the first time that Raman imaging can be used to distinguish successfully between glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins in normal and cancer tissue. Thousands of protein, lipid and glycan species exist in cells and tissues and their metabolism is monitored via numerous pathways, networks and methods. The metabolism can change in response to cellular environment alterations, such as development of a disease. Measuring such alterations and understanding the pathways involved are crucial to fully understand cellular metabolism in cancer development. In this paper Raman markers of glycogen, glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate proteoglycan were identified based on their vibrational signatures. High spatial resolution of Raman imaging combined with chemometrics allows separation of individual species from many chemical components present in each cell. We have found that metabolism of proteins, lipids and glycans is markedly deregulated in breast (adenocarcinoma) and brain (medulloblastoma) tumors.

The endocytosis implies the entrapment of DDSs in acidic vesicles (endosomes and lysosomes) and their eventual ejection by exocytosis. This process, intrinsic to eukaryotic cells, is one of the main drawbacks of DDSs because it reduces the drug bioavailability in the intracellular environment. The escape of DDSs from the acidic vesicles is, therefore, crucial to enhance the therapeutic performance at low drug dose. To this end, we developed a multifunctionalized DDS that combines high specificity towards cancer cells with endosomal escape capabilities. Doxorubicin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles were functionalized with polyethylenimine, a polymer commonly used to induce endosomal rupture, and hyaluronic acid, which binds to CD44 receptors, overexpressed in cancer cells. We show irrefutable proof that the developed DDS can escape the endosomal pathway upon polymeric functionalization. Interestingly, the combination of the two polymers resulted in higher endosomal escape efficiency than the polyethylenimine coating alone. Hyaluronic acid additionally provides the system with cancer targeting capability and enzymatically controlled drug release. Thanks to this multifunctionality, the engineered DDS had cytotoxicity comparable to the pure drug whilst displaying high specificity towards cancer cells. The polymeric engineering here developed enhances the performance of DDS at low drug dose, holding great potential for anticancer therapeutic applications. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Results showed that NLC-Citral induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in MDA MB-231 cells. Furthermore, a prominent anti-metastatic ability of NLC-Citral was demonstrated in vitro using scratch, migration and invasion assays. A significant reduction of migrated and invaded cells was observed in the NLC-Citral treated MDA MB-231 cells. To further evaluate the apoptotic and anti-metastatic mechanism of NLC-Citral at the molecular level, microarray-based gene expression and proteomic profiling were conducted. Based on the result obtained, NLC-Citral was found to regulate several important signaling pathways related to cancer development such as apoptosis, cell cycle, and metastasis signaling pathways. Additionally, gene expression analysis was validated through the targeted RNA sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction.

Using tissue microarrays from 657 surgically treated primary lung cancers, we evaluated the mucin stains periodic acid-Schiff with diastase (PASD), alcian blue–periodic acid-Schiff (ABPAS) and mucicarmine, and compared with the IHC markers p40, p63, cytokeratin 5, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), napsin A and cytokeratin 7. Ten or more cytoplasmic mucin inclusions in a tissue microarray core were seen in 51%, 48% and 31% of the 416 adenocarcinomas and 3%, 4% and 0.5% of the 194 squamous cell carcinomas with PASD, ABPAS and mucicarmine, respectively.

To test this hypothesis, PDAC patients were classified into either high or low CD31 expression groups utilizing mRNA expression from RNA-sequence data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pancreatic cancer cohort. High expression of CD31, which indicates presence of more vascular endothelial cells, was associated with significantly better OS (p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that residual tumor (R1, 2; p = 0.026) and CD31 low expression (p = 0.007) were the only independent predictors that negatively impacted OS. Vascular stability as well as immune response related pathways were significantly upregulated in the CD31 high expressing tumors.

Gene expression data and clinical information from 494 triple-negative breast tumors were obtained from public databases. First, a probabilistic graphical model approach to associate gene expression profiles was performed. Then, sparse k-means was used to establish a new molecular classification. Results were then verified in a second database including 153 triple-negative breast tumors treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Clinical and gene expression data from 494 triple-negative breast tumors were analyzed. Tumors in the dataset were divided into four subgroups (luminal-androgen receptor expressing, basal, claudin-low and claudin-high), using the cancer stem cell hypothesis as reference. These four subgroups were defined and characterized through hierarchical clustering and probabilistic graphical models and compared with previously defined classifications. In addition, two subgroups related to immune activity were defined. This immune activity showed prognostic value in the whole cohort and in the luminal subgroup. The claudin-high subgroup showed poor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Through a novel analytical approach we proved that there are at least two independent sources of biological information: cellular and immune. Thus, we developed two different and overlapping triple-negative breast cancer classifications and showed that the luminal immune-positive subgroup had better prognoses than the luminal immune-negative.

While BCL2A1, BCL2L2 and MCL1 are prone to splicing perturbation, BCL2L1 exhibits resistance to E7107-induced splicing modulation.

Interestingly, a low concentration of paclitaxel was able to induce strong apoptosis in the PLS3-silenced cells. Further study revealed that p38 MAPK signalling was responsible for the increased sensitivity to paclitaxel in these cells, as the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 impaired the changes mediated by PLS3 down-regulation in response to paclitaxel. Therefore, our study identifies PLS3 as a potential target for enhancing the p38 MAPK-mediated apoptosis induced by paclitaxel. Unlike paclitaxel, Abraxane was unable to induce strong apoptosis in the PLS3-silenced cells. As PLS3 was found to be involved in the process of endocytosis in breast cancer cells, the reliance of cellular Abraxane uptake on this process may render it not as efficient as paclitaxel in PLS3-depleted tumour cells.

This is particularly important for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) for which chemotherapy is a major form of treatment. Here we designed and screened a library of 30 peptides starting with a previously reported epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting peptide GE11 (YHWYGYTPQNVI). A direct peptide array-whole cell binding assay, where the peptides are conjugated to a cellulose membrane, was used to identify four peptides with enhanced binding to TNBC cells. Next, the four peptides were synthesized as FITC-labelled soluble peptides to study their direct uptake by TNBC cells using flow cytometry. The results showed that peptide analogue 22 had several fold higher uptake by the TNBC cells compared to the lead peptide GE11. The specific uptake of the peptide analogue 22 was confirmed by competition experiment using pure EGF protein. Further, peptide 22 showed dose dependent uptake by the TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells (10 5 ) with uptake saturating at around 2 μM peptide concentration. Thus, peptide 22 is a promising EGFR specific TNBC cell binding peptide that can be conjugated directly to a chemotherapeutic drug or to nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy for TNBC treatment. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Inotilone, a major component of Inonotus linteus, is a traditional Chinese medical herb. In this study, MTT results showed that inotilone had no obvious cytotoxicity. Animal model results revealed that inotilone suppressed cancer metastatic efficacy. Serum results showed that inotilone reduced the activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) activity as well as NO content. Additionally, inotilone affected MMP-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 protein expression and improved the activity of the antioxidant enzymes in the lung tissues of LLC-bearing mice. In addition, cell experimental results showed that inotilone reduced the activity of MMP-2/-9 and inhibited the ability for cellular migration and invasion. Inotilone decreased interleukin (IL)-8 expression in A549 cells. Western blot results revealed that inotilone affected the protein expression of MMPs, nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, anti-oxidant enzymes, mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)-AKT, and nuclear factor (NF)κB.

Myeloid cells exert both anti- and pro-tumor functions and chemokines are known to drive immune cell migration towards cancer cells. It is documented that CXCR4 signaling supports tumor metastasis formation in tissues where CXCL12, its cognate ligand, is abundant. On the other hand, the role of the neutrophilic CXCR4 signaling in driving cancer invasion and metastasis formation is poorly understood. Here, we use the zebrafish xenotransplantation model to study the role of CXCR4 signaling in driving the interaction between invasive human tumor cells and host neutrophils, supporting early metastasis formation. We found that zebrafish cxcr4 (cxcr4b) is highly expressed in neutrophils and experimental micrometastases fail to form in mutant larvae lacking a functional Cxcr4b. We demonstrated that Cxcr4b controls neutrophil number and motility and showed that Cxcr4b transcriptomic signature relates to motility and adhesion regulation in neutrophils in tumor-naïve larvae. Finally, Cxcr4b deficient neutrophils failed to interact with cancer cells initiating early metastatic events. In conclusion, we propose that CXCR4 signaling supports the interaction between tumor cells and host neutrophils in developing tumor metastases. Therefore, targeting CXCR4 on tumor cells and neutrophils could serve as a double bladed razor to limit cancer progression. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Using multiple aggressive murine models of triple-negative breast cancer, we have recently demonstrated that the early administration of oncolytic Maraba virus (MRB) prior to surgical resection of the primary tumor is sufficient to minimize the metastatic burden, protect against tumor rechallenge, cure a fraction of the mice and sensitize refractory tumors to immune checkpoint blockade without the need for further treatment. Here, we apply our surgical model to other OVs: Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Adenovirus (Ad), Reovirus (Reo) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and show that all of the tested OVs could positively change the outcome of the treated animals. The growth of the primary and secondary tumors was differently affected by the various OVs and most of the viruses conferred survival benefits in this neoadjuvant setting despite the absence of direct treatment following rechallenge.

We recently uncovered that SMARCA4 loss in an ovarian cancer subtype causes cyclin D1 deficiency leading to susceptibility to CDK4/6 inhibition. Here, we show that this vulnerability is conserved in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where SMARCA4 loss also results in reduced cyclin D1 expression and selective sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors. In addition, SMARCA2, another SWI/SNF subunit lost in a subset of NSCLCs, also regulates cyclin D1 and drug response when SMARCA4 is absent. Mechanistically, SMARCA4/2 loss reduces cyclin D1 expression by a combination of restricting CCND1 chromatin accessibility and suppressing c-Jun, a transcription activator of CCND1. Furthermore, SMARCA4 loss is synthetic lethal with CDK4/6 inhibition both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that FDA-approved CDK4/6 inhibitors could be effective to treat this significant subgroup of NSCLCs. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

It represents, on average, 0.5-1% of all tumours in males globally and occurs predominantly in older individuals (&gt; 65 years). The geographical distribution of malignant cancer of the penis is reported. A higher incidence is observed in less developed parts of the world, particularly in South America, Southeast Asia, and some areas of Africa (&gt; 2.0/100,000). In Slovakia, there has been a recent increase in incidence (1.1/100,000 in 2011). Mortality has stabilized at 0.3/100,000 in recent years. Significant risk factors for malignant cancers include social and cultural habits and hygienic and religious practices. Important risk factors are inadequate hygiene of the foreskin sac, phimosis, human papillomavirus infection, sexual promiscuity, smoking, genital infections, and a low socio-economic and educational status. PURPOSE: The present paper provides an overview of pathology, symptomatology, diagnostic approaches, and classification of the extent of the disease. Treatment of the primary tumour depends on the extent of the disease and includes topical treatment, photodynamic treatment, cryoablation, laser photocoagulation, conservative surgical treatment, especially circumcision, and even radical treatment - penile amputation with perineal urethrostomy. An important part of the management of this malignancy is surgical treatment of metastases in inguinal lymph nodes. The article devotes more attention to non-surgical treatment modalities, in particular radiotherapy (external and brachytherapy) and systemic therapy (chemotherapy and biologic therapy), offering an overview of the indications and regimens in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant and palliative approaches, with and without concomitant chemoradiotherapy, and describes possible adverse effects of the treatments.  Conclusion: Patients with penile cancer should be concentrated in centres that have abundant experience in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease.

It has been shown to be of clinical value for patients both in the primary and secondary stages of prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the effective dose and organ doses from injection of [68Ga]PSMA-11 in a cohort of low-risk prostate cancer patients. Methods: Six low-risk prostate cancer patients were injected with 133–178 MBq [68Ga]PSMA-11 and examined with four PET/CT acquisitions from injection to 255 min post-injection. Urine was collected up to 4 h post-injection, and venous blood samples were drawn at 45 min, 85 min, 175 min, and 245 min post-injection.

The software IDAC-Dose 2.1 was used to calculate absorbed organ doses according to the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) publication 107 using specific absorbed fractions published in ICRP 133 and effective dose according to ICRP Publication 103. We also estimated the absorbed dose to the eye lenses using Monte Carlo methods. Results: [68Ga]PSMA-11 was rapidly cleared from the blood and accumulated preferentially in the kidneys and the liver. The substance has a biological half-life in blood of 6.5 min (91%) and 4.4 h (9%). The effective dose was calculated to 0.022 mSv/MBq. The kidneys received approximately 40 mGy after an injection with 160 MBq [68Ga]PSMA-11 while the lacrimal glands obtained an absorbed dose of 0.12 mGy per administered MBq. Regarding the eye lenses, the absorbed dose was low (0.0051 mGy/MBq).

However, due to their ultralow concentration in patient blood, the CTCs must first be enriched before such analysis can be performed. Classical microfiltration is an important and widely used method for the mechanical enrichment of CTCs. This method exploits that CTCs are generally larger than the accompanying blood cells, however, does not differentiate the cells in other ways. In an affinity filtration, selectivity is added by functionalizing the membrane with specific antibodies against a CTC-characteristic surface protein such as the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). A common shortcoming of both filtration approaches is that there is still a poor understanding of the enrichment process and the systems developed so far are frequently operated under non-optimized conditions. To address this, systematic filtration experiments are performed in this work using the EpCAM + cell line MCF-7 as CTC-model and standard track-etched membranes modified with or without antibodies against EpCAM. The influences of the key filtration parameters time and applied pressure are studied and it is found that in all cases the extent of cell recovery is limited by a lysis process which occurs on the membrane surface. Counterintuitively, it is found that filtration at rather high pressures is advantageous to ensure high recovery rates. To describe the pressure-induced lysis process a biophysical model is developed. This model allows the determination of optimum filtration conditions to achieve both high cancer cell recovery and large blood sample throughput. It is demonstrated that this way practically 100% of spiked cancer cells can be recovered from milliliters of undiluted whole blood within seconds. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

This retrospective analysis of 299 breast cancer patients investigated the association between RDW and RPR and clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis, compared to platelet distribution width to platelet count ratio (PDW/P) which is a known independent prognostic factor in patients with breast cancer. We found a significant correlation between RPR, and age and HER2 status. An elevated RPR significantly correlated with age and HER2 status. After a median follow-up duration of 48 months, tumour size, nuclear grade, PDW/P, and RPR were recgnized to be significantly associated with lower disease-free survival rates (tumour size: p < 0.01; nuclear grade, PDW/P, and RPR: p < 0.05) in univariate analysis. Tumour size and RPR were significant prognostic factors for lower disease-free survival rates, with hazard ratios of 4.31 (95% confidence interval: 1.76–10.53) (p < 0.01)] and 2.79 [95% confidence interval: 1.01–87.69) (p < 0.05)], respectively, in a multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model. This is the first study showing that an elevated RPR could independently predict poor prognosis in patients with breast carcinoma. Thus, RPR could be a novel biomarker for prognostic estimation. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

The goal of this study is to investigate the incidence of RP after radiochemotherapy with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in patients with esophageal cancer and correlate this with dose volume histogram (DVH) related parameters. For this purpose, the clinical course of 73 patients was evaluated and irradiation doses to the lungs were extracted from radiotherapy treatment plans. Furthermore, a systematic review on this topic was conducted across PubMed. In our institutional cohort, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade II or higher RP occurred in four patients (5.5%). The systematic review identified 493 titles of which 19 studies reporting 874 patients qualified for the final analysis. No grade IV or V RP after radiochemotherapy with IMRT for esophageal cancer was reported in the screened literature. Grade II or higher RP is reported in 6.6% of the patients. A higher incidence can be seen with increasing values for lung V20. In conclusion, our institutional data and the literature consistently show a low incidence of symptomatic RP after radiochemotherapy in patients with esophageal cancer treated with IMRT. However, efforts should be made to keep the lung V20 below 23% and specific caution is warranted in patients with pre-existing lung conditions. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Review,Scopus

Therefore, it is crucial to identify novel molecular features unique to lung tumors. Here, we show that cyclopamine tartrate (CycT) strongly suppresses the growth of subcutaneously implanted non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) xenografts and nearly eradicated orthotopically implanted NSCLC xenografts. CycT reduces heme synthesis and degradation in NSCLC cells and suppresses oxygen consumption in purified mitochondria. In orthotopic tumors, CycT decreases the levels of proteins and enzymes crucial for heme synthesis, uptake, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). CycT also decreases the levels of two regulators promoting OXPHOS, MYC and MCL1, and effectively alleviates tumor hypoxia. Evidently, CycT acts via multiple modes to suppress OXPHOS. One mode is to directly inhibit mitochondrial respiration/OXPHOS. Another mode is to inhibit heme synthesis and degradation. Both modes appear to be independent of hedgehog signaling. Addition of heme to NSCLC cells partially reverses the effect of CycT on oxygen consumption, proliferation, and tumorigenic functions. Together, our results strongly suggest that CycT suppress tumor growth in the lung by inhibiting heme metabolism and OXPHOS. Targeting heme metabolism and OXPHOS may be an effective strategy to combat lung cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Overexpression and knock-down studies of FOXM1 in colon cancer cells suggest the importance of FOXM1 in TYMS regulation. ChIP and global ChIP-seq data also confirms that FOXM1 can also potentially regulate other 5-FU targets, such as TYMS, thymidine kinase 1 (TK-1) and thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP). In human colorectal cancer tissue specimens, a strong correlation of FOXM1 and TYMS staining was observed. Elevated FOXM1 and TYMS expression was also observed in acquired 5-FU resistant colon cancer cells (HCT116 5-FU Res). A synergistic effect was observed following treatment of CRC cells with an inhibitor of FOXM1, thiostrepton, in combination with 5-FU. The combination treatment decreased colony formation and migration, and induced cell cycle arrest, DNA damage, and apoptosis in CRC cell lines.

Although IL13Rα2 is implicated in the progression of various types of cancer, its expression and roles in the malignant melanoma have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we showed that IL13Rα2 was expressed in approximately 7.5% melanoma patients. While IL13Rα2 expression in human melanoma cells decreased their proliferation in vitro, it promoted in vivo tumour growth and angiogenesis in melanoma xenograft mouse model. We also found that the expression of amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, was correlated with IL13Rα2 expression in cultured melanoma cells, xenograft tumour tissues and melanoma clinical samples. Furthermore, expression of amphiregulin promoted tumour growth, implicating causal relationship between the expression of IL13Rα2 and amphiregulin.

Brain metastases are thought to occur via seeding of circulating tumour cells into the brain microvasculature; within this unique microenvironment, tumour growth is promoted and the penetration of systemic medical therapies is limited. Development of brain metastases remains a substantial contributor to overall cancer mortality in patients with advanced-stage cancer because prognosis remains poor despite multimodal treatments and advances in systemic therapies, which include a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapies. Thus, interest abounds in understanding the mechanisms that drive brain metastases so that they can be targeted with preventive therapeutic strategies and in understanding the molecular characteristics of brain metastases relative to the primary tumour so that they can inform targeted therapy selection. Increased molecular understanding of the disease will also drive continued development of novel immunotherapies and targeted therapies that have higher bioavailability beyond the blood–tumour barrier and drive advances in radiotherapies and minimally invasive surgical techniques.

The paternal-age-at-conception (PAC) effect on TL is puzzling, and its biological implication at the population level is unknown. Using a probabilistic model of transgenerational TL and population dynamics, we simulated the effect of PAC on TL in individuals over the course of 1,000 years. Findings suggest a key role for an isometric PAC midpoint (PACmp) in modulating TL across generations, such that offspring conceived by males younger than the isometric PACmp have comparatively short telomeres, while offspring conceived by males older than the isometric PACmp have comparatively long telomeres. We further show that when cancer incidence escalates, the average PAC drops below the isometric PACmp and transgenerational adaptation to cancer ensues through TL shortening. We propose that PAC serves to maintain an optimal TL across generations. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Using single-particle tracking techniques, we developed a phenotyping asssay named Transmembrane Receptor Dynamics (TReD), studied the dynamics of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in seven breast epithelial cell lines and developed a phenotyping assay named Transmembrane Receptor Dynamics (TReD). Here we show a clear evidence that increased EGFR diffusivity and enlarged EGFR confinement size in the plasma membrane (PM) are correlated with the enhanced metastatic potential in these cell lines. By comparing the TReD results with the gene expression profiles, we found a clear negative correlation between the EGFR diffusivities and the breast cancer luminal differentiation scores (r = −0.75). Upon the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), EGFR diffusivity significantly increased for the non-tumorigenic MCF10A (99%) and the non-invasive MCF7 (56%) cells, but not for the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 cell.

However, high risk cases with lymph node (LN) metastasis are indication of radical surgery. Furthermore, rectal NETs are often associated with late recurrences and/or multiple cancer development. Therefore, proper surgical indication and patients’ management are required. We investigated the clinicopathological features of 79 rectal NET cases in order to elucidate risk factors for synchronous LN metastasis, recurrence, and multiple cancers. Recently, we reported that in pancreatic NET patients, a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in PHLDA3 was associated with poorer prognosis, and that LOH of both PHLDA3 and MEN1 was frequently observed. Therefore, PHLDA3 and MEN1 LOH were also assessed in rectal NET patients for their association with clinicopathological features. Of the 79 patients, LN metastases were found in 12.7%, recurrences in 3.8%, and multiple cancers in 30.4% of the subjects. PHLDA3 and MEN1 LOH were found in 60.0% and 66.7% of the subjects, respectively. Lymphatic invasion and WHO classification 2010 were found to be independent risks for LN metastasis. There were three cases of recurrence, all of which occurred more than 3 years after resection and two of which exhibited LN metastasis. Older age and LOH in PHLDA3 were associated with the presence of multiple cancers. Long-term and systemic management of patients with rectal NETs is therefore recommended in accordance with these risk factors. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Of the various chemical species emitted during cooking, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and aldehydes are two chemical species with carcinogenic or tumor promoting characteristics. Although PAH exposure has been studied in commercial kitchen workers, few studies have investigated simultaneous exposure to PAHs and aldehydes in these workers. The aims of this study were to compare personal concentrations of PAH and aldehyde in three commercial cooking workplaces and to estimate their corresponding cancer risks. The three cooking workplaces included western fast food restaurant kitchens, Chinese cafeteria kitchens, and street food carts. Comparisons showed that workers in western fast food restaurant kitchens and Chinese cafeteria kitchens tended to have lower personal concentrations of these pollutants compared to workers in street food carts. The geometric mean (95% CI) cancer risks in the three workplaces were, from lowest to highest, 1.36 (1.12–1.67) × 10 −5 for western fast food restaurant kitchens, 1.52 (1.01–2.28) × 10 −5 for Chinese cafeteria kitchens, and 3.14 (2.45–4.01) × 10 −5 for street food carts. The percentage contributions of aldehyde species to cancer risk were very high (74.9–99.7%). Street food cart workers had high personal exposure to aldehyde probably due to lack of effective exhaust systems. Thus, their cancer risk was significantly higher than those of workers in western fast food restaurant kitchens (p &lt; 0.001) and Chinese cafeteria kitchens (p = 0.013). © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Here, we examined the in vivo and in vitro inhibitory effect of extracts of Qizhu decoction (a traditional Chinese medicine) on hepatitis caused by diethylnitrosamine or hepatitis B virus and on diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocellular carcinoma. The results showed that both the aqueous and ethanol extracts (QC and QS, respectively) of Qizhu decoction significantly inhibited hepatic inflammation and liver cancer induced by diethylnitrosamine or hepatitis B virus by suppressing NF-κB signaling and decreasing the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β. Both QC and QS inhibited the proliferation and migration of primary cancer hepatocytes by reducing cyclin B1, cyclin D1 and N-cadherin expression and increasing E-cadherin expression. QC and QS also promoted the apoptosis of primary cancer hepatocytes by upregulating caspase-3 and downregulating BCL-2 expression. The knockdown of p65 in NF-κB signaling inhibited the ability of QC and QS to significantly reduce the colony formation ability of liver cancer cells.

RNA-Seq was performed on the Illumina HiSeq. 2500 and data were mapped against human and mouse genomes separately to differentiate species-specific expression. Differentially expressed (DE) genes were identified and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was used to detect clusters of highly co-expressed genes. Melatonin treatment reduced tumor growth (p < 0.01). 57 DE genes were identified in murine cells, which represented the TME, and were mainly involved in immune response. The WGCNA detected co-expressed genes in tumor cells and TME, which were related to the immune system among other biological processes.

In this study, JMJD3 expression was determined. The prognostic significance of JMJD3 and its association with clinical parameters were evaluated. JMJD3 dysregulation mechanism and targets were analyzed. The effect of JMJD3 mutation was determined by functional study. Results showed that JMJD3 was overexpressed in different patient cohorts and also by bioinformatics analysis. High JMJD3 expression was correlated with shortened overall survival in patients with GC and was an independent prognosis predictor. Genetic aberration and DNA methylation might be involved in the deregulation of JMJD3 in GC. Downstream network of JMJD3 was analyzed and several novel potential targets were identified. Furthermore, functional study discovered that both demethylase-dependent and demethylase-independent mechanisms were involved in the oncogenic role of JMJD3 in GC. Importantly, histone demethylase inhibitor GSK-J4 could reverse the oncogenic effect of JMJD3 overexpression. In conclusion, our study report the oncogenic role of JMJD3 in GC for the first time.

The KRAS mutations, which are identified in approximately 20% of NSCLC patients, have shown to be associated with the resistance to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Currently, there is no clinically available targeted therapy which can effectively inhibit NSCLC tumors harboring KRAS mutations. This study aims to show the effectiveness of KYA1797K, a small molecule which revealed anti-cancer effect in colorectal cancer by destabilizing Ras via inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, for the treatment of KRAS-mutated NSCLC. While erlotinib fail to have anti-transforming effect in NSCLC cell lines harboring KRAS mutations, KYA1797K effectively inhibited the Ras-ERK pathway in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines. As a result, KYA1797K treatment suppressed the growth and transformation of KRAS mutant NSCLC cells and also induced apoptosis. Furthermore, KYA1797K effectively inhibited Kras-driven tumorigenesis in the Kras LA2 mouse model by suppressing the Ras-ERK pathway.

Our results indicate that activated c-Src in the endosomal membrane promoted the secretion of exosomes, in which c-Src was encapsulated. In addition, the ESCRT-interacting molecule, Alix was identified as a c-Src–interacting protein in exosomes. We revealed that the interaction between the SH3 domain of c-Src and the proline-rich region of Alix activates ESCRT–mediated intra-luminal vesicle (ILV) formation, resulting in the upregulation of exosome secretion in c-Src–transformed cells. We observed also a correlation between malignant phenotypes and Alix–dependent aberrant exosome secretion in Src–upregulated cancer cells.

Approximately 10–16% of patients with breast cancer develop brain metastases (BCBM). However, no systemic therapy has gained regulatory approval for the specific treatment of BCBM and this remains an area of persistent, unmet medical need. Rapid, predictive and clinically-relevant animal models are critical to study the biology of brain metastases and to identify effective therapeutic approaches for patients with BCBM. Here, we describe a method for efficient establishment of orthotopic mouse models of patient-derived brain metastases via an improved intracarotid injection protocol that permits tumor cell growth in the unique brain microenvironment without compromising the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We demonstrate that our newly improved models of patient-derived brain metastases recapitulate the histologic, molecular, and genetic characteristics of their matched patient tumor specimens and thus represent a potentially powerful tool for pre-clinical and translational research. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

The mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) within this microenvironment has been demonstrated to influence growth and the migratory phenotype that precedes invasion. Here we present the integration of a label-free quantitative phase imaging technique, spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM)—with protein-conjugated hydrogel substrates—to explore how the stiffness of the ECM influences melanoma cells of varying metastatic potential. Melanoma cells of high metastatic potential demonstrate increased growth and velocity characteristics relative to cells of low metastatic potential. Cell velocity in the highly metastatic population shows a relative insensitivity to matrix stiffness suggesting adoption of migratory routines that are independent of mechanics to facilitate invasion. The use of SLIM and engineered substrates provides a new approach to characterize the invasive properties of live cells as a function of microenvironment parameters. This work provides fundamental insight into the relationship between growth, migration and metastatic potential, and provides a new tool for profiling cancer cells for clinical grading and development of patient-specific therapeutic regimens. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

The mutational frequency of EGFR and KRAS genes in lung adenocarcinoma varies worldwide per ethnicity and smoking. The impact of EGFR and KRAS mutations in Brazilian lung cancer remains poorly explored. Thus, we investigated the frequency of EGFR and KRAS mutations in a large Brazilian series of lung adenocarcinoma together with patients’ genetic ancestry, clinicopathological and sociodemographic characteristics. The mutational frequency of EGFR was 22.7% and KRAS was 20.4%. The average ancestry proportions were 73.1% for EUR, 13.1% for AFR, 6.5% for AME and 7.3% for ASN. EGFR mutations were independently associated with never-smokers, high-Asian ancestry, and better performance status. KRAS mutations were independently associated with tobacco exposure and non-Asian ancestry. EGFR-exon 20 mutations were associated with worse outcome. The Cox regression model indicated a worse outcome for patients whose were older at diagnosis (>61 y), solid histological subtype, loss of weight (>10%), worse performance status (≥2), and presence of KRAS mutations and EGFR mutational status in TKi non-treated patients. In conclusion, we assessed the clinicopathological and ethnic impact of EGFR and KRAS mutations in the largest series reported of Brazilian lung adenocarcinomas. These findings can support future clinical strategies for Brazilian lung cancer patients. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

The present work examines the antitumoral effect of maintained neutrophilia induced via the injection of recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF, 100 μg/kg/day) in a Panc-1 subcutaneous xenograft murine model of pancreatic cancer. This treatment was compared with gemcitabine administration (120 mg/kg every two days) and a saline control (n = 6–7 mice per group). Compared to the controls, both the rhG-CSF- and gemcitabine-treated mice showed significantly suppressed tumor growth by day 4 (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.013 respectively). From a mean starting volume of 106.9 ± 3.1 mm 3 for all treatment groups, the final mean tumor volumes reached were 282.0 ± 30.7 mm 3 for the rhG-CSF-treated mice, 202.6 ± 18.1 mm 3 for the gemcitabine-treated mice and 519.4 ± 62.9 mm 3 for the control mice (p &lt; 0.004 and p &lt; 0.01, respectively, vs. control). The rhG-CSF-treated tumors showed higher percentage necrosis than those treated with gemcitabine (37.4 ± 4.6 vs. 7.5 ± 3.0; p &lt; 0.001). This is the first report of a clear anti-tumoral effect of rhG-CSF when used in monotherapy against pancreatic cancer. Since rhG-CSF administration is known to be associated with very few adverse events, it may offer an attractive alternative in the clinical treatment of pancreatic cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Previously, for sensitizing tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-resistant human fibrosarcoma (HT1080), we developed and validated a dynamic computational model that showed the inhibition of protein kinase (PK)C, using bisindolylmaleimide (BIS) I, enhances apoptosis with 95% cell death. Although promising, the long-term effect of remaining ~ 5% cells is a mystery. Will they remain unchanged or are they able to proliferate? To address this question, here we adopted a discrete spatiotemporal cellular automata model utilizing simple rules modified from the famous “Conway’s game of life”. Based on three experimental initializations: cell numbers obtained from untreated (high), treatment with TRAIL only (moderate), and treatment with TRAIL and BIS I (low), the simulations show cell proliferation in time and space. Notably, when all cells are fixed in their initial space, the proliferation is rapid for high and moderate cell numbers, however, slow and steady for low number of cells. However, when mesenchymal-like random movement was introduced, the proliferation becomes significant even for low cell numbers. Experimental verification showed high proportion of mesenchymal cells in TRAIL and BIS I treatment compared with untreated or TRAIL only treatment. In agreement with the model with cell movement, we observed rapid proliferation of the remnant cells in TRAIL and BIS I treatment over time. Hence, our work highlights the importance of mesenchymal-like cellular movement for cancer proliferation. Nevertheless, re-treatment of TRAIL and BIS I on proliferating cancers is still largely effective. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

This study set out to quantify general practitioner (GP) and lung specialist attendance and diagnostic imaging in the lead-up to a diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and identify common pathways to diagnosis in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. We used linked health data for participants of the 45 and Up Study (a NSW population-based cohort study) diagnosed with NSCLC between 2006 and 2012. Our main outcome measures were GP and specialist attendances, X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest and lung cancer-related hospital admissions. Among our study cohort (N = 894), 60% (n = 536) had ≥4 GP attendances in the 3 months prior to diagnosis of NSCLC, 56% (n = 505) had GP-ordered imaging (chest X-ray or CT scan), 39% (N = 349) attended a respiratory physician and 11% (N = 102) attended a cardiothoracic surgeon. The two most common pathways to diagnosis, accounting for one in three people, included GP and lung specialist (respiratory physician or cardiothoracic surgeon) involvement. Overall, 25% of people (n = 223) had an emergency hospital admission. For 14% of people (N = 129), an emergency hospital admission was the only event identified on the pathway to diagnosis. We found little effect of remoteness of residence on access to services. This study identified a substantial proportion of people with NSCLC being diagnosed in an emergency setting. Further research is needed to establish whether there were barriers to the timely diagnosis of these cases. © 2019, Crown.",,Article,Scopus

Here, we report that an IRE1α RNase-specific inhibitor, MKC8866, strongly inhibits prostate cancer (PCa) tumor growth as monotherapy in multiple preclinical models in mice and shows synergistic antitumor effects with current PCa drugs. Interestingly, global transcriptomic analysis reveal that IRE1α-XBP1s pathway activity is required for c-MYC signaling, one of the most highly activated oncogenic pathways in PCa. XBP1s is necessary for optimal c-MYC mRNA and protein expression, establishing, for the first time, a direct link between UPR and oncogene activation. In addition, an XBP1-specific gene expression signature is strongly associated with PCa prognosis. Our data establish IRE1α-XBP1s signaling as a central pathway in PCa and indicate that its targeting may offer novel treatment strategies. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

correlation between cancers can provide important insights into the mechanisms driving cancer etiology. Using genome-wide association study summary statistics across six cancer types based on a total of 296,215 cases and 301,319 controls of European ancestry, here we estimate the pair-wise genetic correlations between breast, colorectal, head/neck, lung, ovary and prostate cancer, and between cancers and 38 other diseases. We observed statistically significant genetic correlations between lung and head/neck cancer (r g = 0.57, p = 4.6 × 10 −8 ), breast and ovarian cancer (r g = 0.24, p = 7 × 10 −5 ), breast and lung cancer (r g = 0.18, p =1.5 × 10 −6 ) and breast and colorectal cancer (r g = 0.15, p = 1.1 × 10 −4 ). We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics. Functional enrichment analysis revealed a significant excess contribution of conserved and regulatory regions to cancer heritability. Our comprehensive analysis of cross-cancer heritability suggests that solid tumors arising across tissues share in part a common germline genetic basis. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

However, although most therapies are still based on antimitotic agents, which are causing wide secondary effects, there is an increasing interest for metabolic therapies that can minimize side effects. In the early 20 th century, Otto Warburg revealed that cancer cells rely on the cytoplasmic fermentation of glucose to lactic acid for energy synthesis (called “Warburg effect”). Our investigations aim to reverse this effect in reprogramming cancer cells’ metabolism. In this work, we present a metabolic therapy specifically targeting the activity of specific enzymes of central carbon metabolism, combining the METABLOC bi-therapeutic drugs combination (Alpha Lipoic Acid and Hydroxycitrate) to Metformin and Diclofenac, for treating tumors implanted in mice. Furthermore, a dynamic metabolic model describing central carbon metabolism as well as fluxes targeted by the drugs allowed to simulate tumors progression in both treated and non-treated mice, in addition to draw hypotheses on the effects of the drugs on tumor cells metabolism. Our model predicts metabolic therapies-induced reversed Warburg effect on tumor cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

However, the principle that oncogenic Wnt signalling could be specifically targeted remains controversial. Here we examine the requirement of BCL9/9l, constituents of the Wnt-enhanceosome, for intestinal transformation following loss of the tumour suppressor APC. Although required for Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells and regeneration, Bcl9/9l deletion has no impact upon normal intestinal homeostasis. Loss of BCL9/9l suppressed many features of acute APC loss and subsequent Wnt pathway deregulation in vivo. This resulted in a level of Wnt pathway activation that favoured tumour initiation in the proximal small intestine (SI) and blocked tumour growth in the colon. Furthermore, Bcl9/9l deletion completely abrogated β-catenin driven intestinal and hepatocellular transformation. We speculate these results support the just-right hypothesis of Wnt–driven tumour formation. Importantly, loss of BCL9/9l is particularly effective at blocking colonic tumourigenesis and mutations that most resemble those that occur in human cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

As a complex natural extract, deguelin interacts with various molecular targets to exert its anti-tumor properties at nanomolar level. It induces cell apoptosis by blocking anti-apoptotic pathways, while inhibiting tumor cell multiplication and malignant transformation through p27-cyclin-E-pRb-E2F1- cell cycle control and HIF-1alphaVEGF antiangiogenic pathways. In silico studies of deguelin and its derivatives is performed to explore interactions with Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E to understand the molecular insights of derivatives with the receptors.

HSATII RNA expression in tissue from two chronic HCMV colitis patients correlates with the strength of CMV antigen staining. Thus, endogenous HSATII RNA synthesis after herpesvirus infections appears to have functionally important consequences for viral replication and may provide a novel insight into viral pathogenesis.

The binding affinity of both the complexes with CT-DNA was explored adopting UV-visible, fluorescence, circular dichroism spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry techniques. The results revealed that both the complexes interacted with DNA via intercalation as well as notable groove binding. Protein (BSA) binding ability of these complexes was investigated by absorption and emission spectroscopy which indicate that these complexes engage in strong hydrophobic interaction with BSA. The mode of interaction between these complexes and CT-DNA/BSA was studied by molecular docking analysis. The in vitro cytotoxic property of the complexes was evaluated in A549 (human small cell lung carcinoma) and VERO (African green monkey kidney cells). The results revealed that the complexes affect viability of the cells. AO and EB staining and cell cycle analysis revealed that the mode of cell death is apoptosis. Both the complexes showed profound inhibition of angiogenesis as revealed in in-vivo chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Of the two complexes, the complex 2 proved to be much more efficient in affecting the viability of lung cancer cells than complex 1. These results indicate that the cobalt(III) Schiff base complexes in this study can be potentially used for cancer chemotherapy and as inhibitor of angiogenesis, in general, and lung cancer in particular, for which there is need for substantiation at the level of signalling mechanisms and gene expressions. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Despite the fact that the surgery is associated with a high rate of morbidity, it is currently the only real option that can effect a cure. Material and methods: Patients who underwent PE between January 2011 and July 2017 in our centre were retrospectively reviewed. Data related to surgery, complications and outcomes were recorded. Results: Twenty-three patients were included. PE was performed due to recurrent gynaecological cancer, persistence of disease and after first diagnosis in 19 (82%), 2 (9%) and 2 patients (9%), respectively. Total PE was performed in 15 cases (65%), followed by anterior PE in 5 cases (22%) and posterior PE in 3 cases (13%). Early grade II, III and IV complications occurred in 15 (65%), 5 (22%) and 2 patients (9%), respectively. No mortality was observed within 30 days. Medium-late grade II, III, IV and V complications occurred in 15 (65%), 11 (48%), 3 (13%) and 2 cases (9%), respectively. Two patients died after > 30-day period from surgery-related complications. The overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 48 months after PE was 41.6% and 30.8% respectively. Conclusions: PE provides about a 40% 4-year survival chance in a selected group of patients. The early-complications rate and 30-day mortality were acceptable. Nevertheless, the medium-late complication grades II–V were 65, 48, 18 and 9%, respectively.

In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of coronatine (COR) on the proliferation of metastatic melanoma cells. COR inhibited the proliferation of melanoma cells but negligibly affected the proliferation of normal melanocytes. Comparative metabolic and lipidomic profiling using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and direct infusion-mass spectrometry was performed to investigate COR-induced metabolic changes. These analyses identified 33 metabolites and 82 lipids. Of these, the levels of lactic acid and glutamic acid, which are involved in energy metabolism, significantly decreased in COR-treated melanoma cells. Lipidomic profiling indicated that ceramide levels increased in COR-treated melanoma cells, suggesting that ceramides could function as a suppressor of cancer cell proliferation. In contrast, the levels of phosphatidylinositol (PI) species, including PI 16:0/18:0, 16:0/18:1, 18:0/18:0, and 18:0/18:1, which were found to be potential biomarkers of melanoma metastasis in our previous study, were lower in the COR-treated cells than in control cells.

We further show that on the long run CI-deficient tumors re-adapt to their inability to respond to hypoxia, concordantly with the persistence of human oncocytomas. We demonstrate that CI-deficient tumors survive and carry out angiogenesis, despite their inability to stabilize HIF-1α. Such adaptive response is mediated by tumor associated macrophages, whose blockage improves the effect of CI ablation.

We have used fluorescence-tagged antibodies to activate MET in live serum-starved glioblastoma cells and monitor the fate of antibody-bound MET receptor in single cell-based assays. We found that the antibodies induced rapid and transient formation of highly polarized MET clusters on the plasma membrane and promoted the activation of MET, resembling the initial effects of binding to its ligand, HGF. However, the antibody-induced clustering and activation of MET led to the rapid removal of the receptor from cell surface and altered its intracellular processing, resulted in rapid degradation of the receptor. Consequently, while cells pre-treated with HGF remain competent to respond to further HGF stimulation, cells pre-treated with antibodies are refractory to further HGF stimulation due to antibody-mediated MET depletion. Removal of MET by sustained treatment of antibodies blocked cancer cell migration and invasion. Our studies reveal a novel mechanism to alter the recycling process of MET in glioblastoma cancer cells by promoting the receptor degradation through a proteasome-sensitive and lysosome-dependent pathway through the ligand-independent activation of MET using anti-MET antibodies. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

We demonstrated that WTX frequently lost in CRC which was highly correlated with cell proliferation, tumor invasion and metastasis. Mechanistically, WTX loss disrupts the interaction between RhoGDIα and CDC42 by losing of the binding with RhoGDIα and triggers the activation of CDC42 and its downstream cascades, which promotes CRC development and liver metastasis.

Hep3B cells are significantly more sensitive to cell killing by fenofibrate than hepatoma HepG2, lung cancer CH27 and oral cancer HSC-3 cells. From the result of docking simulation, fenofibrate can bind excellently to the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase (FASN) binding site as orlistat, a FASN inhibitor, acts. The fenofibrate-induced cell cytotoxicity was protected by addition of palmitate, indicating that the cytotoxic effect of fenofibrate is due to starvation of Hep3B cells by inhibiting the formation of end product in the FASN reaction. Inhibition of lipid metabolism-related proteins expression, such as proteins containing thioesterase domain and fatty acid transport proteins, was involved in the fenofibrate-induced Hep3B cell death. Fenofibrate caused S and G2/M cell cycle arrest by inducing cyclin A/Cdk2 and reducing cyclin D1 and E protein levels in Hep3B cells. The anti-tumor roles of fenofibrate on Hep3B cells by inducing apoptosis and necroptosis were dependent on the expression of Bcl-2/caspase family members and RIP1/RIP3 proteins, respectively.

Five-year survival rate of OvCa ranges from 30–92%, depending on the spread of disease at diagnosis. Role of chemokines is well appreciated in cancer, including OvCa. However, their precise role is understudied. Here, we show clinical and biological significance of CXCR6-CXCL16 and ADAM10 in OvCa. Expression of CXCR6 and N-terminal CXCL16 was significantly higher in serous carcinoma tissues compared to endometrioid. OvCa cells (SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3) also showed higher expression of CXCR6 than normal ovarian epithelial cells (IOSE-7576) while CXCL16 was higher in SKOV-3 than IOSE-7576. Furthermore, N-terminal CXCL16 was higher in conditioned media of OvCa cells than IOSE-7576. Compared to OVCAR-3, SKOV-3 cells, which had higher CXCL16, expressed significantly higher transcripts of ADAM10, a protease that cleaves CXCL16. OVCAR-3 cells showed higher CXCR6 specific migration whereas SKOV-3 cells showed more invasion. Difference in invasive potential of these cells was due to modulation of different MMPs after CXCL16 stimulation. Higher CXCR6 expression in serous papillary carcinoma tissues suggests its association with aggressive OvCa. Increased migration-invasion towards CXCL16 implies its role in metastatic spread. Therefore, CXCR6-CXCL16 axis could be used to differentiate between aggressive versus non-aggressive disease and as a target for better prognosis. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

We have demonstrated that tumors expressing EGFR can be targeted with PIT. However, PIT may be less effective when a tumor lacks “overwhelming” expression of a single target such as EGFR. We present a combinatorial PIT approach for targeting BC expressing EGFR and HER2, using PA- labeled panitumumab (pan) and trastuzumab (tra), respectively. Human BC tissues and cell lines were analyzed for EGFR and HER2 expression. Efficacy of PA-labeled MAbs singly and in combination was analyzed. About 45% of BC tissues stain for both EGFR and HER2. In vitro, the combination of pan IR700 and tra IR700 with NIR was more efficacious than either agent alone. Tumor xenografts treated with combination PIT showed significant tumor growth retardation.

We have modified a convolutional deep network model, U-net (originally designed for segmentation purposes), for predicting dose from patient image contours of the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR). We show that, as an example, we are able to accurately predict the dose of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer patients, where the average Dice similarity coefficient is 0.91 when comparing the predicted vs. true isodose volumes between 0% and 100% of the prescription dose. The average value of the absolute differences in [max, mean] dose is found to be under 5% of the prescription dose, specifically for each structure is [1.80%, 1.03%](PTV), [1.94%, 4.22%](Bladder), [1.80%, 0.48%](Body), [3.87%, 1.79%](L Femoral Head), [5.07%, 2.55%](R Femoral Head), and [1.26%, 1.62%](Rectum) of the prescription dose. We thus managed to map a desired radiation dose distribution from a patient’s PTV and OAR contours. As an additional advantage, relatively little data was used in the techniques and models described in this paper. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

However, the success of these approaches is highly dependent on the availability of large manually detailed annotated dataset. Thus an automatic refined segmentation of whole-slide image (WSI) is significant to alleviate the annotation workload of pathologists. But most of the current ways can only output a rough prediction of lesion areas and consume much time in each slide. In this paper, we propose a fast and refined cancer regions segmentation framework v3_DCNN, which first preselects tumor regions using a classification model Inception-v3 and then employs a semantic segmentation model DCNN for refined segmentation. Our framework can generate a dense likelihood heatmap with the 1/8 side of original WSI in 11.5 minutes on the Camelyon16 dataset, which saves more than one hour for each WSI compared with the initial DCNN model. Experimental results show that our approach achieves a higher FROC score 83.5% with the champion’s method of Camelyon16 challenge 80.7%. Based on v3 DCNN model, we further automatically produce heatmap of WSI and extract polygons of lesion regions for doctors, which is very helpful for their pathological diagnosis, detailed annotation and thus contributes to developing a more powerful deep learning model. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

PGRMC1 consists of a short N-terminal extracellular or luminal domain, a single membrane-spanning domain, and a long cytoplasmic domain. Previously, we generated two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 108-B6 and 4A68 that recognize cell surface-expressed PGRMC1 (csPGRMC1) on human pluripotent stem cells and some cancer cells. In this study, flow cytometric analysis found that an anti-PGRMC1 antibody recognizing the N-terminus of PGRMC1 could not bind to csPGRMC1 on cancer cells, and 108-B6 and 4A68 binding to csPGRMC1 was inhibited by trypsin treatment, suggesting that the epitopes of 108-B6 and 4A68 are trypsin-sensitive. To examine the epitope specificity of 108-B6 and 4A68, glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-fused PGRMC1 mutants were screened to identify the epitopes targeted by the antibodies. The result showed that 108-B6 and 4A68 recognized C-terminal residues 183–195 and 171–182, respectively, of PGRMC1, where trypsin-sensitive sites are located. A polyclonal anti-PGRMC1 antibody raised against the C-terminus of PGRMC1 could also recognized csPGRMC1 in a trypsin-sensitive manner, suggesting that the C-terminus of csPGRMC1 is exposed on the cell surface. This finding reveals that csPGRMC1 has a non-conventional plasma membrane topology, which is different from that of intracellular PGRMC1. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

While oncogene addiction has been experimentally validated in advanced tumor models, its role in tumor precursors has not been investigated. We utilized the requirement of Forkhead box A1 (Foxa1) for transcriptional activation of the Upk2-promoter to temporally control the expression of Upk2-HRAS* oncogene, an inducer of urothelial hyperplasia in transgenic mice. Inducible homozygous knockout of Foxa1 in Upk2-HRAS*/UBC-Cre ERT2 /Foxa1 loxp/loxp mice results in reduced HRAS* levels. This led to a marked reduction of urothelial proliferation as evidenced by urothelial thinning, degenerative changes such as intracellular vacuole formation, and reduced Ki67 expression. Reduced proliferation did not affect basal, Krt14-positive cells, supporting the fact that Foxa1-regulated Upk2-HRAS* expression occurs primarily in supra-basal cells. Our results indicate that maintenance of urothelial hyperplasia in Upk2-HRAS* mice depends on continuous expression of Foxa1 and activated HRAS, and that mutated receptor tyrosine kinases, FOXA1 and/or other downstream effectors may mediate oncogene addiction in urothelial hyperplasia. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

The major problem with using radiation to approximate surgery in unresectable disease is that the radiation dose required to ablate pancreatic cancer exceeds the tolerance of the nearby duodenum. WR-2721, also known as amifostine, is a well-known radioprotector, but has significant clinical toxicities when given systemically. WR-2721 is a prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite, WR-1065, by alkaline phosphatases in normal tissues. The small intestine is highly enriched in these activating enzymes, and thus we reasoned that oral administration of WR-2721 just before radiation would result in localized production of the radioprotective WR-1065 in the small intestine, providing protective benefits without the significant systemic side effects. Here, we show that oral WR-2721 is as effective as intraperitoneal WR-2721 in promoting survival of intestinal crypt clonogens after morbid irradiation. Furthermore, oral WR-2721 confers full radioprotection and survival after lethal upper abdominal irradiation of 12.5 Gy × 5 fractions (total of 62.5 Gy, EQD2 = 140.6 Gy). This radioprotection enables ablative radiation therapy in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer and nearly triples the median survival compared to controls. We find that the efficacy of oral WR-2721 stems from its selective accumulation in the intestine, but not in tumors or other normal tissues, as determined by in vivo mass spectrometry analysis. Thus, we demonstrate that oral WR-2721 is a well-tolerated, and quantitatively selective, radioprotector of the intestinal tract that is capable of enabling clinically relevant ablative doses of radiation to the upper abdomen without unacceptable gastrointestinal toxicity. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Therefore, combination of therapeutic strategies was raised to effectively improve disease prognosis. In this regard, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are considered significant due to their anticancer properties. This study aimed to return sensitivity to cisplatin to A2780 cisplatin-resistance cell lines in the presence of biogenic synthesis curcumin-coated silver nanoparticles (cAgNPs). Synergic cellular effects of cAgNPs and cisplatin on ovarian carcinoma 2780 resistant to cisplatin cells were assessed using MTT assay, Acridine orange (AO)/propidium iodide (PI), DAPI staining, Annexin V/PI assay, and caspase 3/9 activation assay. Finally, expression of p53 and MMP-9 genes were evaluated using semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). According to the results, 8 µg/mL and 62 µg/mL of cAgNPs and cisplatin led to 50% cell death in 48 h, respectively. Therefore, we combined non-toxic concentration of nanoparticles (1-5 µg/mL) with cisplatin (2.5 µg/mL). Decreased proliferation rate was about 50% for synergic use of cisplatin (2.5 µg/mL) and cAgNPs (2 µg/ mL). According to the results, cell death induction significantly increased by AO/PI, DAPI staining and Annexin V/PI assay in the combined group. Moreover, activity of caspase 3/9 significantly increased in the mentioned group. The combined use of cAgNPs and cisplatin resulted in upregulated expression of p53 gene and downregulated expression of MPP-9 gene. As observed in this study, a combination of cAgNPs and cisplatin increased the efficiency of apoptosis induction in A2780 cells, compared to the independent use of cisplatin or cAgNPs. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

Protosappanin B caused concentration-dependent inhibition of cell growth, with IC50 of 82.78 µg/mL in T24 cells and 113.79 µg/mL in 5637 cells. Protosappanin B caused concentration-dependent increases in T24 and 5637 cell apoptosis (100–300 µg/mL). The effects of protosappanin B on the cell cycle in both cell types was G1 arrest with reductions in the proportion of S-phase cells and proliferation index. A proteomics analysis showed that protosappanin B modulated a number of genes involved in the cell cycle. In conclusion, protosappanin B inhibits the proliferation and promotes the apoptosis of T24 and 5637 human bladder cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner, possibly via interference with cell cycle regulation, preventing G1-to-S transition. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

To overcome these problems, one strategy is the application of nanomaterials and drug delivery systems to efficiently deliver the anticancer agents to tumour tissues with minimum toxic effects on healthy organs. In this study a graphene oxide nanohybrid (GO/NHs) was designed and fabricated for the delivery of chemotherapeutic agent fluorouracil (FU) to the breast cancer MCF7 cells. After preparation and characterization of GO/NHs, several biological analysis including haemolysis assay, cytotoxicity assay, cellular uptake, apoptosis assay, and protein expression were performed. The cytotoxic effects of FU, FU loaded GO/NHs (FU-GO/NHs), and blank GO/NHs was determined by MTT assay. The results of MTT assay showed no significant cytotoxicity for blank nano-hybrid on MCF7 cells. Furthermore, FU-GO/NHs were more cytotoxic than free FU. The uptake analysis results showed that developed nanocarrier could completely be internalized into the cells in the first hour. Besides, apoptotic effects and nuclear morphology changes of cells was evaluated by DAPI staining under fluorescent microscopy. Protein expression levels of p53, PARP, cleaved PARP, Bcl-2, and Bax were determined by western blot analysis. Western blot results showed higher levels of p53 and cleaved PARP after treatment with FU-GO/NHs, however, no substantial effect was observed for Bax and Bcl-2 protein concentrations.","cancer treatment; drug delivery; fluorouracil; Graphene oxide nanohybrid",Article,Scopus

The antiproliferation activities of the resulted formulas were evaluated in the MCF-7 breast cancer cells and HeLa cervical cancers cells. The cytotoxic effect of the NE formulas was detected by the MTT assay, DAPI stain and light microscopy. The z-average diameters range of LEM-IFO and SAL-IFO, determined by the zetasizer, were 49.15–61.81 nm and 56.64–64.62 nm, respectively. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of LEM-IFO and SAL-IFO, applied into the HeLa cells, were 0.165 ± 0.025 and 0.141 ± 0.035 mM, respectively, whereas the IC50 of LEM-IFO and SAL-IFO subjected into the MCF-7 cells were 0.200 ± 0.005 mM and 0.270 ± 0.025 mM, respectively. The IC50 of the free IFO was markedly larger than LEM-IFO and SAL-IFO when applied into MCF-7 cells (9.20 ± 2.01 mM) and HeLa cells (7.69 ± 1.88 mM). Among the tested formulas, LEM-IFO and SAL-IFO have the greatest apoptotic effect on the MCF-7 and HeLa cells, respectively.

An official report published by the Mexican National Center for the Control and Prevention of Cancer in the Pediatric and Adolescent Populations, reported a lymphoma OS of 71% (including all Hodgkin and NHL). The Mexican Association of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology conducted a retrospective study to analyze the clinical characteristics and outcomes of children with diagnosis of B-NHL in Mexico, in order to perceive the main areas of improvement in the health care. METHODS: From 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2016, 166 pediatric patients were diagnosed with B-cell NHL at the participant institutions. RESULTS: According to histology the outcomes were 5-year EFS 63%, for BL/BLL, and 80% DLBCL, (P = .051), 5-year PFS 81%, for BL/BLL, and 91% for DLBCL, (P = .126), and 5-year OS 71%, for BL/BLL, and 83% for DLBCL, (P = .095). DISCUSSION: Overall, 18 patients died due to acute treatment toxicity, resulting in a cumulative incidence of toxic death of 10.84% and an early death rate of 7.23%, defined as <30 days after initial treatment. In conclusion, there is an urgent need to establish an academic collaboration to create strategies to improve pediatric cancer care according to our resources, especially in diseases with expected excellent prognosis as B-NHL.

Molecular imaging techniques capable of detecting such changes have become essential for cancer diagnosis, treatment planning, and surveillance. In particular, 18 F-FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) PET has emerged as an essential imaging modality for cancer because of its unique ability to detect a disturbed molecular pathway through measurements of glucose uptake. However, FDG-PET has limitations that restrict its usefulness in certain situations and the information gained is limited to glucose uptake only. 13 C magnetic resonance spectroscopy theoretically has certain advantages over FDG-PET, but its inherent low sensitivity has restricted its use mostly to single voxel measurements unless dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP) is used to increase the signal, which brings additional complications for clinical use. We show here a new method of imaging glucose metabolism in vivo by MRI chemical shift imaging (CSI) experiments that relies on a simple, but robust and efficient, post-processing procedure by the higher dimensional analog of singular value decomposition, tensor decomposition. Using this procedure, we achieve an order of magnitude increase in signal to noise in both dDNP and non-hyperpolarized non-localized experiments without sacrificing accuracy. In CSI experiments an approximately 30-fold increase was observed, enough that the glucose to lactate conversion indicative of the Warburg effect can be imaged without hyper-polarization with a time resolution of 12s and an overall spatial resolution that compares favorably to 18 F-FDG PET. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

PCL is characterized by the presence of clonal plasma cells in peripheral blood. There are two forms of PCL - primary which presents de novo in patients with no evidence of previous multiple myeloma and secondary which is a leukemic transformation of relapsed or refractory dis-ease in patients with previously recognized multiple myeloma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is the first study to provide information on PCL epidemiology in the Czech population us-ing The Czech National Cancer Registry (CNCR) as the basic source of data for the population-based evaluation of PCL epidemiology. RESULTS: Accord-ing to CNCR data, there were on average six newly dia-gnosed cases of PCL and four deaths caused by PCL each year in the Czech Republic in the period 2000-&#8202;2015. PCL incidence in the Czech Republic was reported at 0.57 per million in 2000-&#8202;2015. We suppose that most reported cases of PCL are primary PCL because secondary PCL is a relapse of a previously reported myeloma and, in most cases, is not coded as an independent dia-gnosis in the CNCR. CONCLUSION: Data from registries such as the CNCR can provide useful information on epidemiology of various dis-eases. These data, however, have several limitations, such as dia-gnostic criteria and proper cod-ing of not only the dis-ease itself, but also its various forms. These limitations have to be taken into account dur-ing the process of results interpretation.

We investigated tissue micro arrays (TMAs) with tumor samples of two independent cohorts of RCC patients (N = 265 and N = 345); we used immunohistochemistry to assess the protein expression of Piwi-like 1. Applying an immunoreactive score (IRS), we found Piwi-like 1 positivity (IRS > 0) in 28.3% and 14.8% of the tumors in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. Piwi-like 1 positivity was correlated with Fuhrman grade, tumor stage and the presence of distant metastasis (P < 0.005). Moreover, in univariate and multivariate analyses (adjusted to Fuhrman grade and tumor stage), Piwi-like 1 positivity was associated with a shorter cancer-specific survival in the patients in the second cohort.

Increased PES1 and ERα protein levels and decreased ERβ protein level were correlated with the aggressive behaviors of PTC patients such as large tumor size, extrathyroidal extension (ETE), lymph node metastasis (LNM), high BRAFV600E expression and high TNM stage.

During 10 years of follow-up, 7,386 incident liver disease cases were recorded among 503,991 participants without prior cancer or chronic liver disease at baseline. The mean body mass index (BMI) (SD) was 23.7 (3.3) kg/m 2 and mean waist circumference (WC) 80.3 (9.8) cm, with 33% having BMI ≥25 kg/m 2 . Throughout the range examined (BMI 15–50) BMI showed a log-linear positive association with NAFLD (n = 1,298), with adjusted HR per 5 kg/m 2 of 2.81 (95% CI 2.63–3.01), adjusting for regression dilution. There were also positive associations of percent body fat, WC, and waist-to-hip ratio with NAFLD, with HRs per 1-SD of 2.27 (2.14–2.41), 2.60 (2.44–2.76), and 1.84 (1.76–1.92). BMI was unrelated to viral hepatitis (n = 1,477), and had a U-shaped association with cirrhosis (n = 2,082) and an inverse association with liver cancer (n = 2,568), which disappeared after excluding the first 5 years of follow-up. Among Chinese adults, adiposity was a major risk factor for NAFLD but not other chronic liver diseases. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Decades of clinical and basic research have gradually improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of RMS and helped to optimize clinical care. The two major subtypes of RMS, originally characterized on the basis of light microscopic features, are driven by fundamentally different molecular mechanisms and pose distinct clinical challenges. Curative therapy depends on control of the primary tumour, which can arise at many distinct anatomical sites, as well as controlling disseminated disease that is known or assumed to be present in every case. Sophisticated risk stratification for children with RMS incorporates various clinical, pathological and molecular features, and that information is used to guide the application of multifaceted therapy. Such therapy has historically included cytotoxic chemotherapy as well as surgery, ionizing radiation or both. This Primer describes our current understanding of RMS epidemiology, disease susceptibility factors, disease mechanisms and elements of clinical care, including diagnostics, risk-based care of newly diagnosed and relapsed disease and the prevention and management of late effects in survivors. We also outline potential opportunities to further translate new biological insights into improved clinical outcomes. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.",,Review,Scopus

Tumour cells colonizing bone have the capacity to induce the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), which promotes osteoclast differentiation and activation. Tumour-induced osteoclastic bone resorption leads to a vicious cycle between tumours and bone cells that fuels osteolytic tumour growth, causing bone pain and hypercalcaemia. Furthermore, RANKL contributes to bone metastasis by acting as a chemoattractant to bone for tumour cells that express its receptor, RANK. Thus inhibition of the RANKL–RANK pathway is a promising treatment for bone metastasis, and a human monoclonal anti-RANKL antibody, denosumab, has been used in the clinic. However, orally available drugs targeting RANKL must be developed to increase the therapeutic benefits to patients. Here we report the efficacy of the small-molecule RANKL inhibitor AS2676293 in treating bone metastasis using mouse models. Oral administration of AS2676293 markedly inhibited bone metastasis of human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231-5a-D-Luc2 as well as tumour-induced osteolysis. AS2676293 suppressed RANKL-mediated tumour migration in the transwell assay and inhibited bone metastasis of the murine cell line B16F10, which is known not to trigger osteoclast activation. Based on the results from this study, RANKL inhibition with a small-molecule compound constitutes a promising therapeutic strategy for treating bone metastasis by inhibiting both osteoclastic bone resorption and tumour migration to bone. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

The training (194 patients) and validation sets (106 patients), which are mutually independent and include 4 institutions, come from The Cancer Imaging Archive. When compared to a traditional radiomic framework applied to the same patient cohort, our method results in a AUC of 0.88 in predicting distant metastasis.

For this Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an attractive technique as it can quantify site-specific label incorporation.

Combining lineage tracing in two tumour models with transcriptomic analyses, we found that Notch1+ tumour cells are undifferentiated, proliferative and capable of indefinite self-renewal and of generating a heterogeneous clonal progeny. Molecularly, the transcriptional signature of Notch1+ tumour cells highly correlates with ISCs, suggestive of their origin from normal crypt cells. Surprisingly, Notch1+ expression labels a subset of CSCs that shows reduced levels of Lgr5, a reported CSCs marker.

This signature, which consists of genes regulated by MYC and NELFE, an RNA binding protein that enhances MYC-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, is predictive of NELFE/MYC-driven tumors that would otherwise not be identified by gene amplification or translocation alone.

(2) Males have a 171% increased chance of dying of cancer when they are married (e.g., a baseline probability of 1.2% when 75 year old) compared to unmarried males. (3) Females with children have only a 34% risk of dying of heart disease (corresponding to a conditional probability of 0.3% when aged 65) relative to females without children and (4) a 53% chance of dying of infections (i.e., 0.1% at 65 years of age) compared to the risk for females without children. (5) At the same age, married men have an increased expectation of 123% of dying of heart disease (corresponding to an expected death probability of 0.7%) compared to unmarried men.

In this study, we examined the effects of metformin, a widely used antidiabetic drug, on cisplatin radiosensitization in NSCLC cell lines. Human NSCLC cell lines, A549 (cisplatin-resistant) and H460 (cisplatin-sensitive), were treated with metformin, cisplatin or a combination of both drugs before ionizing radiation. Cell proliferation, clonogenic assays, western blotting, cisplatin-DNA adduct formation and immunocytochemistry were used to characterize the treatments effects. Metformin increased the radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells. Metformin showed additive and over-additive effects in combination with cisplatin and the radiation response in the clonogenic assay in H460 and A549 cell lines (p = 0.018 for the interaction effect between cisplatin and metformin), respectively. At the molecular level, metformin led to a significant increase in cisplatin-DNA adduct formation compared with cisplatin alone (p < 0.01, ANOVA-F test). This was accompanied by a decreased expression of the excision repair cross-complementation 1 expression (ERCC1), a key enzyme in nucleotide excision repair pathway. Furthermore, compared with each treatment alone metformin in combination with cisplatin yielded the lowest level of radiation-induced Rad51 foci, an essential protein of homologous recombination repair. Ionizing radiation-induced γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci persisted longer in both cell lines in the presence of metformin. Pharmacological inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) demonstrated that metformin enhances the radiosensitizing effect of cisplatin through an AMPK-dependent pathway only in H460 but not in A549 cells. Our results suggest that metformin can enhance the effect of combined cisplatin and radiotherapy in NSCLC and can sensitize these cells to radiation that are not sensitized by cisplatin alone. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Mechanistically, low mitochondrial gene expression in breast cancers is associated with a poor clinical outcome. The hypoxia-activated E3 ligase SIAH2 spatially downregulates nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene expression including pyruvate dehydrogenase beta via degrading NRF1 (Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1) through ubiquitination on lysine 230, resulting in enhanced Warburg effect, metabolic reprogramming and pro-tumor immune response. Dampening NRF1 degradation under hypoxia not only impairs the polarization of TAMs, but also promotes tumor cells to become more susceptible to apoptosis in a FADD-dependent fashion, resulting in secondary necrosis due to the impairment of efferocytosis.

We developed a new small animal research tool called “Diffuse in vivo Flow Cytometry” (DiFC) for detecting extremely rare fluorescently-labeled circulating cells directly in the bloodstream. The technique exploits near-infrared diffuse photons to detect and count cells flowing in large superficial arteries and veins without drawing blood samples. DiFC uses custom-designed, dual fiber optic probes that are placed in contact with the skin surface approximately above a major vascular bundle. In combination with a novel signal processing algorithm, DiFC allows counting of individual cells moving in arterial or venous directions, as well as measurement of their speed and depth. We show that DiFC allows sampling of the entire circulating blood volume of a mouse in under 10 minutes, while maintaining a false alarm rate of 0.014 per minute. In practice, this means that DiFC allows reliable detection of circulating cells below 1 cell per mL. Hence, the unique capabilities of DiFC are highly suited to biological applications involving very rare cell types such as the study of hematogenous cancer metastasis. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Here, we analyzed a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Variants in DNA repair genes were associated with increased tumor mutation and neoantigen burden, which in turn were linked with greater tumor infiltration by activated T cells. The subset of tumors with DNA repair gene variants but without T cell infiltration exhibited upregulation of TGF-β and Wnt pathway genes, and a combined score incorporating these genes and DNA repair status accurately predicted immune cell infiltration. Finally, high neoantigen burden was positively associated with genes related to cytolytic activity and immune checkpoints. These findings provide evidence that DNA repair pathway defects and immunomodulatory genes together lead to specific immunophenotypes in lung squamous cell carcinoma and could potentially serve as biomarkers for immunotherapy. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Until recently, patients routinely proceeded to surgical resection after CRT, regardless of the response. Nowadays, treatment is tailored depending on the response to chemoradiotherapy. In patients that respond very well to CRT, organ-preserving treatments such as watch-and-wait are increasingly considered as an alternative to surgery. To facilitate such personalized treatment planning, there is now an increased demand for more detailed radiological response evaluation after chemoradiation. MRI is one of the main tools used to assess response, but has difficulties in assessing response within areas of post-radiation fibrosis. Hence, MR sequences such as diffusion-weighted imaging are increasingly adopted in clinical MR protocols to improve the differentiation between tumor and fibrosis.

Small molecule inhibitors of this complex have been identified, characterized, and used to validate the rationale of targeting this step to curtail tumor cell growth and modulate chemotherapy response. One such class of compounds are the rocaglates, secondary metabolites from the plant genus Aglaia, which target the RNA helicase subunit of eIF4F, eIF4A.

In this study, the prevalence of osteoporosis increased after curative surgery, associated with disease-specific, treatment-related, and population risk factors. Purpose: Improved oncologic outcomes in esophageal cancer (EC) have resulted in increased survivorship and a focus on long-term quality of life. Malnutrition and micronutrient malabsorption are common among patients with EC, but the effect on bone metabolism is not known. The aim of this study was to characterize changes in bone mineral density (BMD) following curative esophagectomy. Methods: Consecutive disease-free patients who underwent esophagectomy with gastric conduit for pathologically node-negative disease from 2000 to 2014 were included. BMD was assessed at vertebral levels T12-L5 by computed tomography using a simple trabecular region-of-interest attenuation technique, and serum markers of nutritional status and bone metabolism were examined. Independent risk factors for osteoporosis were identified by multivariable logistic regression. Results: Seventy-five consecutive patients were studied. Osteoporosis was present in 25% at diagnosis. BMD declined at 1 and 2 years postoperatively (144.3 ± 45.8 versus 128.6 ± 46.2 and 122.7 ± 43.5 Hounsfield Units (HU), P < 0.0001), with increased osteoporosis prevalence to 38% and 44% (P = 0.049), respectively. No significant postoperative change in vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate was observed, but alkaline phosphatase increased significantly (P < 0.001). While female sex (P = 0.004) and ASA grade (P = 0.043) were independently associated with osteoporosis at diagnosis, age (P = 0.050), female sex (P = 0.023), smoking (P = 0.024), and pathologic T stage (P = 0.023) were independently predictive of osteoporosis at 1 year postoperatively. Conclusions: Osteoporosis is prevalent among disease-free patients post-esophagectomy for EC, associated with disease-specific, treatment-related, and population risk factors. Strategies which minimize BMD decline should be considered to avoid fragility fractures in this cohort. © 2019, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.","Bone; Bone mineral density; Esophageal cancer; Esophagectomy; Malabsorption; Malnutrition",Article,Scopus

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) expresses mutant von Hippel-Lindau gene and is difficult to treat. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and 2-α (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) as well as microRNA-21 (miR-21) can regulate the proliferation and migration of ccRCC cells. However, the association between HIF-α and miR-21 in ccRCC remains unclear. Therefore, the effects of pCS on ccRCC cells were investigated for HIF-α and miR-21 signals. Our results showed that pCS induced overexpression of HIF-1α and promoted the proliferation and regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related proteins, including E-cadherin, fibronectin, twist and vimentin in ccRCC cells. pCS treatment increased miR-21 expression. Specifically, inhibition of miR-21 blocked pCS-induced proliferation and migration. Taken together, the present results demonstrate that pCS directly induced the proliferation and migration of ccRCC cells through mechanisms involving miR-21/HIF-1α signaling pathways. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Moreover, predicting which GC treatments will be effective remains challenging. Computational drug repositioning using public databases is a promising and efficient tool for discovering new uses for existing drugs. Here we used a computational reversal of gene expression approach based on effects on gene expression signatures by GC disease and drugs to explore new GC drug candidates. Gene expression profiles for individual GC tumoral and normal gastric tissue samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GC were determined with a meta-signature analysis. Profiles drug activity and drug-induced gene expression were downloaded from the ChEMBL and the LINCS databases, respectively. Candidate drugs to treat GC were predicted using reversal gene expression score (RGES). Drug candidates including sorafenib, olaparib, elesclomol, tanespimycin, selumetinib, and ponatinib were predicted to be active for treatment of GC. Meanwhile, GC-related genes such as PLOD3, COL4A1, UBE2C, MIF, and PRPF5 were identified as having gene expression profiles that can be reversed by drugs.

The potential effects of cancer treatments on a patient’s future fertility are a major concern affecting the quality of life for cancer survivors. The effects of imatinib on future fertility are unknown. It is teratogenic. Therefore, patients are advised to stop treatment before pregnancy. Unfortunately, CML and GIST have high rates of recurrence in the absence of the drug, therefore halting imatinib during pregnancy endangers the mother. Possible long-term (post-treatment) effects of imatinib on reproduction have not been studied. We have used a mouse model to examine the effects of imatinib on the placenta and implantation after long-term imatinib exposure. We found significant changes in epigenetic markers of key imprinted genes in the placenta. There was a significant decrease in the labyrinth zone and vasculature of the placenta, which could impact fetal growth later in pregnancy. These effects on placental growth occurred even when imatinib was stopped prior to pregnancy. These results indicate potential long-term effects of imatinib on pregnancy and implantation. A prolonged wash-out period prior to pregnancy or extra monitoring for possible placental insufficiency may be advisable. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Selection for different phenotypes may vary with (1) the tumor niche (edge or core), (2) cell turnover rates, (3) the nature of the tradeoff between traits, and (4) whether deaths occur in response to demographic or environmental stochasticity. Using a spatially-explicit agent-based model, we observe how two traits (proliferation rate and migration speed) evolve under different tradeoff conditions with different turnover rates. Migration rate is favored over proliferation at the tumor’s edge and vice-versa for the interior. Increasing cell turnover rates slightly slows tumor growth but accelerates the rate of evolution for both proliferation and migration. The absence of a tradeoff favors ever higher values for proliferation and migration, while a convex tradeoff tends to favor proliferation, often promoting the coexistence of a generalist and specialist phenotype. A concave tradeoff favors migration at low death rates, but switches to proliferation at higher death rates. Mortality via demographic stochasticity favors proliferation, and environmental stochasticity favors migration. While all of these diverse factors contribute to the ecology, heterogeneity, and evolution of a tumor, their effects may be predictable and empirically accessible. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Immunohistochemical expression of HDAC6, hypoxia inducible factors-1α (HIF-1α), programmed death-1 ligand (PD-L1), CD44 (cancer stem cell marker), and ARID1A was analysed for 106 OCCC patients. High nuclear HDAC6 expression correlated with patient death (p = 0.038). In the multivariate analysis of overall survival, surgical status (complete or incomplete resection) (hazard ratio (HR) = 17.5; p = <0.001), HDAC6 nuclear expression (HR = 1.68; p = 0.034), and PD-L1 expression (HR = 1.95; p = 0.022) were the independent prognostic factors.

In particular, tumor cell proliferation persisted and the grade of differentiation and morphological phenotype remained unaltered. Cultured tissue slices were metabolically active and responsive to rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor.

Tumor resection had a major impact on reducing clonal diversity in secondary sites, indicating that most disseminated tumor cells lacked the capacity to ‘seed’, hence originated from ‘shedders’ that did not persist. The few clones that continued to grow after resection i.e. ‘seeders’, did not correlate in frequency with their parental clones in primary tumors. Cisplatin treatment of one BRCA1-mutated PDX model to non-palpable levels had a surprisingly minor impact on clonal diversity in the relapsed tumor yet purged 50% of distal clones.

Moreover, transfection of CRC cells with miR-500a-5p induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibits their growth and migration. Mechanistically, miR-500a-5p directly targets HDAC2 and inhibits HDAC2-mediated proliferation in CRC in nude mice.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and whether all cells have this ability is not fully understood. We find that eleven cancer and non-cancerous cell lines have opposite abilities to tolerate and utilise ammonia to support proliferation in a glutamine-depleted environment. HEK293, Huh7, T47D and MCF7 cells can use ammonia, when starved of glutamine, to support proliferation to varying degrees. Glutamine depletion reduced mTORC1 activity, while additional ammonia supplementation diminished this mTORC1 inhibition. Depletion of glutamine promoted a rapid and transient activation of AMPK, whereas, additional ammonia supplementation blocked this starvation-induced AMPK activation. As expected, drug-induced AMPK activation reduced cell proliferation in glutamine-depleted cells supplemented with ammonia. Surprisingly, mTORC1 activity was largely unchanged despite the enhanced AMPK activity, suggesting that AMPK does not inhibit mTORC1 signalling under these conditions. Finally, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) inhibition, a key enzyme regulating ammonia assimilation, leads to AMPK activation, mTORC1 inhibition and reduced proliferation. Ammonia provides an alternative nitrogen source that aids certain cancer cells ability to thrive in nutrient-deprived environment.

Moreover, GPNA is a well known substrate of the enzyme γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Our aim was to evaluate the effect of GGT-mediated GPNA catabolism on cell viability and Gln transport. The GGT-catalyzed hydrolysis of GPNA produced cytotoxic effects in lung cancer A549 cells, resulting from the release of metabolite p-nitroaniline (PNA) rather than from the inhibition of Gln uptake. Interestingly, compounds like valproic acid, verapamil and reversan were able to increase the cytotoxicity of GPNA and PNA, suggesting a key role of intracellular detoxification mechanisms. Our data indicate that the mechanism of action of GPNA is more complex than believed, and further confirm the poor specificity of GPNA as an inhibitor of Gln transport. Different factors may modulate the final effects of GPNA, ranging from GGT and ASCT2 expression to intracellular defenses against xenobiotics. Thus, other strategies - such as a genetic suppression of ASCT2 or the identification of new specific inhibitors - should be preferred when inhibition of ASCT2 function is required. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

We investigate the repertoire of antigens associated with humoral immune response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) using in-depth proteomic profiling of immunoglobulin-bound proteins from PDAC patient plasmas and identify tumor antigens that induce antibody response together with exosome hallmark proteins. Additional profiling of PDAC cell-derived exosomes reveals significant overlap in their protein content with immunoglobulin-bound proteins in PDAC plasmas, and significant autoantibody reactivity is observed between PDAC cell-derived exosomes and patient plasmas compared to healthy controls. Importantly, PDAC-derived exosomes induce a dose-dependent inhibition of PDAC serum-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity towards cancer cells.

In this study, we analyzed the autophagy-related effect of metformin in both cancer initiation and progression in non-tumorigenic cells. We also analyzed the induction of tumorigenesis in autophagy-deficient cells, and its correlation with the ER stress. Our results showed that metformin induced massive cell death in preneoplastic JB6 Cl 41-5a cells treated with tumor promoter (phorbol) and in NIH/3T3 treated with H2O2. Inhibiting autophagy with wortmannin or ATG7 silencing, the effect of metformin decreased, indicating an autophagy-related cytotoxic activity under stress conditions.

The in vitro demethylase activity of KDM5A is allosterically enhanced by binding of its product, unmodified H3 peptides, to its PHD1 reader domain. However, the molecular basis of this allosteric enhancement is unclear. Here we show that saturation of the PHD1 domain by the H3 N-terminal tail peptides stabilizes binding of the substrate to the catalytic domain and improves the catalytic efficiency of demethylation. When present in saturating concentrations, differently modified H3 N-terminal tail peptides have a similar effect on demethylation. However, they vary greatly in their affinity towards the PHD1 domain, suggesting that H3 modifications can tune KDM5A activity. Furthermore, hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) experiments reveal conformational changes in the allosterically enhanced state.

However, reports on the mode of action and detail mechanism of eupatorin in vitro in breast cancer disease are limited. Hence, eupatorin’s effect on the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 was investigated. MTT assay showed that eupatorin had cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells but was non-toxic to the normal cells of MCF-10a in a time-dose dependent manner. At 24 h, the eupatorin showed mild cytotoxicity on both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with IC 50 values higher than 20 μg/mL. After 48 h, eupatorin at 5 μg/mL inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells by 50% while the IC 50 of MCF-10a was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) high with 30 μg/mL. The concentration of eupatorin at 5 μg/mL induced apoptosis mainly through intrinsic pathway by facilitating higher fold of caspase 9 compared to caspase 8 at 48 h. The cell cycle profile also showed that eupatorin (5 μg/mL) exerted anti-proliferation activity with the cell cycle arrest of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells at sub Gθ/G1 in a time-dependent manner. In addition, wound healing assay showed an incomplete wound closure of scratched MDA-MB-231 cells, and more than 60% of the MDA-MB-231 cells were prevented to migrate and invade the membrane in the Boyden chamber after 24 h. Eupatorin also inhibited angiogenic sprouting of new blood vessels in ex vivo mouse aorta ring assay. In gene expression assay, eupatorin up-regulated pro-apoptotic genes such as Bak1, HIF1A, Bax, Bad, cytochrome c and SMAC/Diablo and blocked the Phospho-Akt pathway. In conclusion, eupatorin is a potent candidate to induce apoptosis and concurrently inhibit the invasion, migration and angiogenesis of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells through inhibition of Phospho-Akt pathway and cell cycle blockade. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

We showed that p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) directly bound to and acetylated δ-catenin, whereas several class I and class II HDACs reversed this effect. Unlike β-catenin, δ-catenin was downregulated by PCAF-mediated acetylation and upregulated by HDAC-mediated deacetylation. The HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A attenuated HDAC1-mediated δ-catenin upregulation, whereas HAT or autophagy inhibitors, but not proteasome inhibitors, abolished PCAF-mediated δ-catenin downregulation. The results suggested that PCAF-mediated δ-catenin acetylation promotes its autophagic degradation in an Atg5/LC3-dependent manner. Deletions or point mutations identified several lysine residues in different δ-catenin domains involved in PCAF-mediated δ-catenin downregulation. PCAF overexpression in prostate cancer cells markedly reduced δ-catenin levels and suppressed cell growth and motility. PCAF-mediated δ-catenin downregulation inhibited E-cadherin processing and decreased the nuclear distribution of β-catenin, resulting in the suppression of β-catenin/LEF-1-mediated downstream effectors.

We found that hypoxia increased mtROS generation and cell invasion in 58As9, but not in MKN45, although the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1α was induced in both cell lines. Colocalisation of lysosomes with mitochondria was found only in hypoxic MKN45 cells, suggesting that hypoxia-induced MQC functions normally in MKN45 but may be impaired in 58As9. Hypoxia did not lead to decreased mitochondrial mass or DNA or altered appearance of autophagosomes, as judged by electron microscopy, suggesting that mitophagy was not induced in either cell line. However, western blot analysis revealed the presence of the MALM-associated proteins Mieap, BNIP3 and BNIP3L, and the lysosomal protein cathepsin D in the mitochondrial fraction of MKN45 cells under hypoxia.

An NADPH oxidase assay proved that the inhibitory effect of metformin on ROS production was derived from its strong suppression of NADPH oxidase, a key producer of ROS in cells. Compared with conditioned media (CM) derived from HCT116 cells treated with LCA, CM derived from HCT116 cells pretreated with metformin and then treated with LCA lost all stimulatory effect on endothelial cell proliferation and tubelike formation.

We demonstrate the translational potential of an AMPK and BCL-2/BCL-XL co-targeting strategy in ex vivo and in vivo models of MYC-high breast cancer. Metformin combined with navitoclax or venetoclax efficiently inhibited tumor growth, conferred survival benefits and induced tumor infiltration by immune cells. However, withdrawal of the drugs allowed tumor re-growth with presentation of PD-1+/CD8+ T cell infiltrates, suggesting immune escape. A two-step treatment regimen, beginning with neoadjuvant metformin+venetoclax to induce apoptosis and followed by adjuvant metformin+venetoclax+anti-PD-1 treatment to overcome immune escape, led to durable antitumor responses even after drug withdrawal.

Ion channels have a role in mediating TM signal; recently we have demonstrated a functional collaboration between Kv10.1 and Orai1 channels in mediating the pro-survival effect of collagen 1 on BC cells. Here we show how SPCA2 (Secretory Pathway Ca2+ ATPase) has a role in this process and is able to support survival and proliferation induced by collagen 1. By participating to an auto-sustaining loop, SPCA2 enhances membrane expression of Kv10.1 and Orai1; the activity of every component of this trio is necessary to mediate a store independent calcium entry (SICE). This SICE is fundamental to maintain both the activation of the pro-survival pathway and the membrane localization and consequently the activity of the two channels. Moreover, the three proteins and the collagen receptor DDR1 are overexpressed only in aggressive tumors tissues. In this work, we propose a novel association between SPCA2, Kv10.1 and Orai1 involved in mediating transduction signals from TM to the BC cells that can be potentially exploited in the search of novel therapeutic targets specific to tumor tissues. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Unlike most conventional primases, PrimPol proficiently discriminates against ribonucleotides (NTPs), being able to start synthesis using deoxynucleotides (dNTPs), yet the structural basis and physiological implications for this discrimination are not understood. In silico analyses based on the three-dimensional structure of human PrimPol and related enzymes enabled us to predict a single residue, Tyr 100 , as the main effector of sugar discrimination in human PrimPol and a change of Tyr 100 to histidine to boost the efficiency of NTP incorporation. We show here that the Y100H mutation profoundly stimulates NTP incorporation by human PrimPol, with an efficiency similar to that for dNTP incorporation during both primase and polymerase reactions in vitro. As expected from the higher cellular concentration of NTPs relative to dNTPs, Y100H expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and U2OS osteosarcoma cells caused enhanced resistance to hydroxyurea, which decreases the dNTP pool levels in S-phase. Remarkably, the Y100H PrimPol mutation has been identified in cancer, suggesting that this mutation could be selected to promote survival at early stages of tumorigenesis, which is characterized by depleted dNTP pools. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Proteomics technology of sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS) was utilized to compare the protein abundance between the wild-type and the knockout lines, with an attempt to identify transcripts whose translation was influenced by miR-26a. Functional classification of the proteins with significant changes revealed their function in stress response, proliferation, localization, development, signaling, etc. Several proteins in the cell cycle/proliferation signaling pathway were chosen to be validated by western blot and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM).

Following development of an in vitro model using human breast cancer cells lines cultured with a combination of mineralisation-promoting reagents, analysis of calcium deposition, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and changes in expression of key genes was used to monitor the calcification process. Two cell lines were identified as successfully mineralising in vitro, MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3. Mineralising cell lines displayed higher levels of ALP activity that was further increased by addition of mineralisation promoting media. qPCR analysis revealed changes in expression of both pro- (RUNX2) and anti- (MGP, ENPP1) mineralisation genes. Mineralisation was suppressed by chelation of intracellular Ca2+ and inhibition of TRPM7, demonstrating a functional role for the channel in formation of microcalcifications. Increased Mg2+ was also found to effectively reduce calcium deposition.

Significant progress has been made in targeting TICs. However, methods for simultaneously targeting heterogeneous TIC populations are lacking. In this study, we found that treating TNBC cells with chemotherapeutic agents led to a significant accumulation of the ALDH + TIC population. Treating TNBC cells with a disulfiram and copper mixture (DSF/Cu) specifically decreased the ALDH + TIC population and treatment with BKM120, a pan-PI3K inhibitor, significantly decreased the CD44 + /CD24 − TIC population. Furthermore, treatment with DSF/Cu or BKM120 induced higher levels of apoptosis in ALDH + or CD44 + /CD24 − populations, respectively, than in bulk tumor cells. Combining DSF/Cu and BKM120 treatment simultaneously decreased the ALDH + and CD44 + /CD24 − TICs. Using a TNBC tumor xenograft mouse model, we found that DSF/BKM in combination with Taxol significantly reduced the tumor burden and delayed tumor recurrence compared to Taxol treatment alone. Our study is the first of its kind to use two different drugs to abolish two major TIC subtypes simultaneously and inhibit tumor recurrence.

Mutational profiles were obtained by means of next-generation sequencing. Overall, 35 out of 227 samples (15%) carried an ATM mutation. At a median follow-up of 56.6 months, patients with ATM mutated tumors showed a significantly longer median overall survival (OS) versus ATM wild-type ones (64.9 vs 34.8 months; HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.29–0.85; P = 0.01). In the multivariable model, ATM mutations confirmed the association with longer OS (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.33–0.98; P = 0.04). The prognostic impact of ATM mutations was independent from TP53 mutational status and primary tumor location. High heterogeneity score for ATM mutations, possibly reflecting the loss of wild-type allele, was associated with excellent prognosis.

We developed a microfluidic device to form and culture STS spheroids to study the combined cytotoxicities of RT and CT. Uniformly-sized spheroids of two different cell lines, STS 93 and STS 117, were formed in the device. RT doses of 0.5 Gy, 2 Gy, and 8 Gy were used in combination with CT, doxorubicin at 2 µM and 20 µM. The spheroids culture chambers within the device were arranged in a 3 × 5 matrix form. The device was made “peelable”, which enabled us to collect spheroids from each treatment condition separately. Collected spheroids were dissociated into single cells and evaluated using flow cytometry and clonogenic assays. Through this workflow, we observed that STS 93 spheroids treated with doxorubicin die through apoptosis, whereas RT induced death through other pathways.

To provide a surface that is suitable for sustained drug release of the hydrophobic cancer chemotherapy drug camptothecin (CPT), the internal surfaces of pSi films were first modified with 1-dodecene. To further modify the external surface of the pSi samples, an interlayer was applied by silanization with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) following air plasma treatment. In addition, copolymers of N-(2-hydroxypropyl) acrylamide (HPAm) and N-benzophenone acrylamide (BPAm) were grafted onto the external pSi surfaces by spin-coating and UV crosslinking. Each modification step was verified using attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, water contact angle (WCA) measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In order to confirm that the air plasma treatment and silanization step only occurred on the top surface of pSi samples, confocal microscopy was employed after fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugation.

In tumor regions, we observed a decrease in 13 C-leucine production from injected hyperpolarized 13 C-KIC via BCAT compared to the contralateral normal-appearing brain, and an increase in H 13 CO 3 − , a catabolic product of KIC through the mitochondrial BCKDC. A parallel ex vivo 13 C NMR isotopomer analysis following steady-state infusion of [U- 13 C]leucine to glioma-bearing rats verified the increased oxidation of leucine in glioma tissue. Both the in vivo hyperpolarized KIC imaging and the leucine infusion study indicate that KIC catabolism is upregulated through BCAT/BCKDC and further oxidized via the citric acid cycle in F98 glioma. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

The ginsenoside-loaded gold nanoparticles were characterized by various analytical and spectroscopic techniques such as field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, elemental mapping, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Furthermore, drug loading was also determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In addition, DCY51T-AuNps and DCY51T-AuCKNps were resistant to aggregation caused by pH variation or a high ionic strength environment. Cell-based study confirmed that DCY51T-AuCKNps exhibited slightly higher cytotoxicity compared to ginsenoside CK treatment in A549 cells (human lung adenocarcinoma cell line) and HT29 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line). Upon laser treatment, DCY51T-AuCKNps showed enhanced cell apoptosis in A549, HT29 and AGS cells (human stomach gastric adenocarcinoma cell line) compared with only DCY51T-AuCKNps treated cells. In conclusion, this preliminary study identified that DCY51T-AuCKNps act as a potent photothermal therapy agents with synergistic chemotherapeutic effects for the treatment of cancer.","anticancer activity; drug delivery; Ginsenoside CK; gold nanoparticles; green synthesis; photoluminescence; photothermal therapy",Article,Scopus

Clinically, genomically and epigenetically, NEPC resembles other types of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Through pan-NET analyses, we identified ONECUT2 as a candidate master transcriptional regulator of poorly differentiated NETs. ONECUT2 ectopic expression in prostate adenocarcinoma synergizes with hypoxia to suppress androgen signaling and induce neuroendocrine plasticity. ONEUCT2 drives tumor aggressiveness in NEPC, partially through regulating hypoxia signaling and tumor hypoxia. Specifically, ONECUT2 activates SMAD3, which regulates hypoxia signaling through modulating HIF1α chromatin-binding, leading NEPC to exhibit higher degrees of hypoxia compared to prostate adenocarcinomas. Treatment with hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 potently reduces NEPC tumor growth. Collectively, these results highlight the synergy between ONECUT2 and hypoxia in driving NEPC, and emphasize the potential of hypoxia-directed therapy for NEPC patients. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Considering the increasing costs of innovative treatments, both the number and the relevance of cost-effectiveness analyses have increased, meaningfully supporting decision making by stakeholders and policy makers. Notably, cost-effective treatments remain unavailable to patients because they are still unaffordable for a multitude of payers. Objectives: To discuss the differences between cost effectiveness and affordability. Methods: We reviewed the most relevant data on the divergences between cost effectiveness and affordability. In addition, we included our recommendations to improve patients’ access to innovative cancer therapies. Results: The increasing costs of recently launched antineoplastic drugs, as high as $150 000 per year, represent a major barrier to patients’ access to treatments globally. In Brazil, for example, patients’ access to innovative treatments depends greatly on whether the individual has private health insurance. In the public health sector, patients’ access to cost-effective innovative treatments varies according to the financial capacity of the facility, leading to inequalities within the same healthcare system. Conclusions: We conclude that because of the socioeconomic inequality mostly seen in lower and middle-income countries, it is difficult to define a cost-effectiveness threshold by region or a willingness-to-pay threshold affordable to the entire population. We consider that benchmark interventions might help to find an affordable willingness-to-pay threshold, and league table interventions might help policy makers, physicians, and the society to share the decision making. © 2019 ISPOR–The professional society for health economics and outcomes research","drug therapy; health policies; pharmacoeconomics",Article,Scopus

In particular, nucleic acid-based TLR agonists such as short ssRNA and dsRNA molecules, which activate endosomal TLRs, can be delivered to tumors by use of nanoparticle delivery systems. However, such delivery systems bear unspecific side effects and poor pharmacokinetics. To overcome these limitations we developed a system for targeted delivery of a 50 bp dsRNA TLR3 agonist (Riboxxol) to treat PSCA-positive tumor cells, which consists of neutravidin conjugated to mono-biotinylated dsRNA and to humanized mono-biotinylated anti-PSCA single chain antibody derivative scFv(h-AM1)-BAP. The assembly of the components resulted in the formation of nanoparticle-like immunoconjugates designated Rapid Inducer of Cellular Inflammation and Apoptosis (RICIA). Anti-PSCA-RICIA exclusively delivered Riboxxol to PSCA-positive tumor cells as well as subcutaneous tumors. Uptake of anti-PSCA-RICIA induced a type I-interferon response and apoptosis in HEK-Blue hTLR3/PSCA reporter cells and PSCA-positive HT1376 bladder cancer cells in vitro. No such effects were observed when using RICIA coupled to an unspecific control antibody or when using Riboxxol alone. Treatment of HT1376 xenografts in immune-deficient hosts with targeted delivery of TLR3 agonist did not induce adverse effects and only modestly inhibited tumor growth when compared to controls. These results suggest promising activation of innate immune response and apoptosis upon selective delivery of TLR3 agonists in tumor cells. Yet, further studies using syngeneic and orthotopic tumor models are needed to fully exploit the potential of RICIA immunoconjugates. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of polymorphism FcγRIIIa V158F and killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes on the outcome of mCRC patients with KRAS mutations treated with cetuximab. This multicenter Phase II clinical trial included 70 mCRC patients with KRAS mutated. We found KIR2DS4 gene was significantly associated with OS (HR 2.27; 95% CI, 1.08–4.77; P = 0.03).

Multivariate analysis confirmed KIR2DS4 as a favorable prognostic marker for OS (HR 6.71) in mCRC patients with KRAS mutation treated with cetuximab. These data support the potential therapeutic of cetuximab in KRAS mutated mCRC carrying non-functional receptor KIR2DS4 since these patients significantly prolong their OS even after heavily treatment.

Significant advances in cancer treatment and imaging have been reported based on work with a water-soluble bis-sulfonated gallium corrole in both cellular and rodent-based models. We now show that cytotoxicities increase in the order Ga < Fe < Al < Mn < Sb < Au for bis-sulfonated corroles; and, importantly, that they correlate with metallocorrole affinities for very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), the main carrier of lipophilic drugs. As chemotherapeutic potential is predicted to be enhanced by increased lipophilicity, we have developed a novel method for the preparation of cell-penetrating lipophilic metallocorrole/serum-protein nanoparticles (NPs). Cryo-TEM revealed an average core metallocorrole particle size of 32 nm, with protein tendrils extending from the core (conjugate size is ~100 nm). Optical imaging of DU-145 prostate cancer cells treated with corrole NPs (≤100 nM) revealed fast cellular uptake, very slow release, and distribution into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosomes. The physical properties of corrole NPs prepared in combination with transferrin and albumin were alike, but the former were internalized to a greater extent by the transferrin-receptor-rich DU-145 cells. Our method of preparation of corrole/protein NPs may be generalizable to many bioactive hydrophobic molecules to enhance their bioavailability and target affinity. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

The changes in gene expression as a result of exposure to the six studied PCB congeners were sex- and WBC type specific.

Here we show that medulloblastomas driven by the transcription factor Gfi1 are exquisitely dependent on the enzyme lysine demethylase 1 (Kdm1a/Lsd1). We demonstrate that Lsd1 physically associates with Gfi1, and that these proteins cooperate to inhibit genes involved in neuronal commitment and differentiation. We also show that Lsd1 is essential for Gfi1-mediated transformation: Gfi1 proteins that cannot recruit Lsd1 are unable to drive tumorigenesis, and genetic ablation of Lsd1 markedly impairs tumor growth in vivo. Finally, pharmacological inhibitors of Lsd1 potently inhibit growth of Gfi1-driven tumors. These studies provide important insight into the mechanisms by which Gfi1 contributes to tumorigenesis, and identify Lsd1 inhibitors as promising therapeutic agents for Gfi1-driven medulloblastoma. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 promotes RAF-to-MAPK signaling pathway and is an essential factor in RAS-driven oncogenesis. Despite the emergence of SHP2 inhibitors for the treatment of cancers harbouring mutant KRAS, the mechanism underlying SHP2 activation of KRAS signaling remains unclear. Here we report tyrosyl-phosphorylation of endogenous RAS and demonstrate that KRAS phosphorylation via Src on Tyr32 and Tyr64 alters the conformation of switch I and II regions, which stalls multiple steps of the GTPase cycle and impairs binding to effectors. In contrast, SHP2 dephosphorylates KRAS, a process that is required to maintain dynamic canonical KRAS GTPase cycle. Notably, Src- and SHP2-mediated regulation of KRAS activity extends to oncogenic KRAS and the inhibition of SHP2 disrupts the phosphorylation cycle, shifting the equilibrium of the GTPase cycle towards the stalled ‘dark state’. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Its dismal prognosis stems from inefficient therapeutic modalities owing to the lack of understanding about pancreatic cancer pathogenesis. Considering the molecular complexity and heterogeneity of PDAC, identification of novel molecular contributors involved in PDAC onset and progression using global “omics” analysis will pave the way to improved strategies for disease prevention and therapeutic targeting. Meta-analysis of multiple miRNA microarray datasets containing healthy controls (HC), chronic pancreatitis (CP) and PDAC cases, identified 13 miRNAs involved in the progression of PDAC. These miRNAs showed dysregulation in both tissue as well as blood samples, along with progressive decrease in expression from HC to CP to PDAC. Gene-miRNA interaction analysis further elucidated 5 miRNAs (29a/b, 27a, 130b and 148a) that are significantly downregulated in conjunction with concomitant upregulation of their target genes throughout PDAC progression. Among these, miRNA-29a/b targeted genes were found to be most significantly altered in comparative profiling of HC, CP and PDAC, indicating its involvement in malignant evolution. Further, pathway analysis suggested direct involvement of miRNA-29a/b in downregulating the key pathways associated with PDAC development and metastasis including focal adhesion signaling and extracellular matrix organization. Our systems biology data analysis, in combination with real-time PCR validation indicates direct functional involvement of miRNA-29a in PDAC progression and is a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic candidate for patients with progressive disease. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

In this experimental study, Mitochondrial activity, Neutral red uptake, Lactate dehydrogenase (cell necrosis), and cell morphology were assessed under unexposed and ICD-85 exposed conditions. Caspase-9 colorimetric assay kit was used to determine caspase protease activity. Morphological changes in MCF-7 cells on treatment with ICD-85 compared with untreated MCF-7 cells are consistent with characterizing the features of apoptosis such as granulation and cell rounding which finally results in the generation of apoptotic bodies. In contrast, this difference was not observed in normal cells. In MTT assay, ICD-85 induced dose dependent manner cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 cells which were confirmed by neutral red assay. The results showed that inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) value of ICD-85 for MCF-7 cells at 24 h was 36.45 ± 0.38 μg/mL. However, when HDF cells were exposed to ICD-85, no significant elevation of LDH release were observed at concentrations below 20 μg/mL.

However, limited light penetration into most biological tissues have so far prevented its widespread adoption beyond dermatology and a few other oncological applications in which a fiber optic can be threaded to the desired locations via an endoscopic approach (e.g., bladder). In this paper, we introduce an ultrasonically powered implantable microlight source, μLight, which enables in-situ localized light delivery to deep-seated solid tumors. Ultrasonic powering allows for small receiver form factor (mm-scale) and power transfer deep into the tissue (several centimeters). The implants consist of piezoelectric transducers measuring 2 × 2 × 2 mm 3 and 2 × 4 × 2 mm 3 with surface-mounted miniature red and blue LEDs. When energized with 185 mW/cm 2 of transmitted acoustic power at 720 kHz, μLight can generate 0.048 to 6.5 mW/cm 2 of optical power (depending on size of the piezoelectric element and light wavelength spectrum). This allows powering multiple receivers to a distance of 10 cm at therapeutic light output levels (a delivery of 20–40 J/cm 2 light radiation dose in 1–2 hours). In vitro tests show that HeLa cells irradiated with μLights undergo a 70% decrease in average cell viability as compared to the control group. In vivo tests in mice implanted with 4T1-induced tumors (breast cancer) show light delivery capability at therapeutic dose levels. Overall, results indicate implanting multiple µLights and operating them for 1–2 hours can achieve cytotoxicity levels comparable to the clinically reported cases using external light sources. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Analysis of the haplotype between rs3784619 (A/G) and rs11637235 (C/T) revealed that the genotypes with AA-TT (OR = 2.59), AG-TT (OR = 2.29), GG-CC (OR = 2.72), GG-CT (OR = 3.01 (1.83–4.96)) were significantly associated with increased risk of CIN III. More notably, this risk was much greater for CSCC (AA-TT (OR = 3.62), AG-TT (OR = 5.08), GG-CC (OR = 5.28), and GG-CT (OR = 4.23). Additionally, most GG genotypes of rs3784619 were linkage GG-CT, while most TT genotypes of rs11637235 were linkage AA-TT. In conclusion, these findings suggested that the homozygous GG allele of rs3784619 and the TT allele of rs11637235 in the DUT gene significantly increased the risk of CIN III and CSCC. Most GG genotypes of rs3784619 and TT genotypes of rs11637235 were linkage GG-CT and AA-TT, respectively. The TT genotype of rs11637235 was enriched in the HR-HPV-positive cases. These two SNPs of the DUT gene can be early predictive biomarkers of CIN III and CSCC, and may be involved in HR HPV infection. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical relevance of uPA levels in serum of metastatic BC patients and to compare uPA with other blood-based biomarkers. 252 patients were enrolled in this prospective, multicentre study. Blood samples were collected before begin of first-line or later-line systemic treatment. Serum uPA was quantified by a commercially available ELISA. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were detected using CellSearch; other biomarkers (EGFR, VEGF, HER2, RAS p21, TIMP1, CAIX) by ELISA. Using the ROC analysis, the optimal cut-off value (determined by the Youden index) of serum uPA was 2.52 ng/ml. Using this value, 26% of patients had elevated uPA levels. Patients with visceral metastasis and more than one metastatic site were significantly more likely to present with elevated uPA levels. CTC status, serum HER2, RAS p21, CAIX, TIMP1 and VEGF correlated significantly with uPA levels. Elevated uPA levels predicted shorter overall and progression-free survival in univariate analysis (median OS: 7.5 months [95%-CI 4.5–10.5 months] vs. not reached, p < 0.001; PFS: 4.8 [95%-CI: 3.1–6.5] vs. 9.1 [7.4–10.8] months, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, elevated uPA, presence of ≥5 CTCs, elevated RAS p21, higher grading and higher line of therapy were independent predictors of shorter OS, while elevated CTC counts, higher line of therapy and negative estrogen receptor status were independent predictors of shorter PFS. In conclusion, elevated uPA levels independently predict reduced overall survival and improved prognostication in patients with known CTC status. Whether high serum uPA might identify patients most likely to benefit from therapies targeting uPA, remains to be evaluated in future trials. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Enhanced Wnt receptor expression due to mutational inactivation of the ubiquitin ligases RNF43/ZNRF3 recently emerged as a leading cause for cancer development. Consequently, targeting canonical Wnt receptors such as LRP5/6 holds great promise for treatment of such cancer subsets. Here, we employ CIS display technology to identify single-domain antibody fragments (VHH) that bind the LRP6 P3E3P4E4 region with nanomolar affinity and strongly inhibit Wnt3/3a-induced β-catenin-mediated transcription in cells, while leaving Wnt1 responses unaffected. Structural analysis reveal that individual VHHs variably employ divergent antigen-binding regions to bind a similar surface in the third β-propeller of LRP5/6, sterically interfering with Wnt3/3a binding. Importantly, anti-LRP5/6 VHHs block the growth of Wnt-hypersensitive Rnf43/Znrf3-mutant intestinal organoids through stem cell exhaustion and collective terminal differentiation. Thus, VHH-mediated targeting of LRP5/6 provides a promising differentiation-inducing strategy for treatment of Wnt-hypersensitive tumors. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

This dis3E729K allele does not induce defects in 7S→5.8S rRNA processing, although it elicits a requirement for P-body function. While it does not significantly influence cell cycle progression alone, the allele reduces the efficiency of cell cycle arrest in strains with defects in kinetochore assembly. Finally, point mutations in the exonuclease domains of yeast Dis3 elicit genome instability phenotypes; however, these DIS3 mutations do not increase DNA damage or RNA processing defects that lead to the accumulation of polyadenylated RNA in the nucleus.

Overproduction of GH has also been linked to cancer and the microvascular complications that are associated with diabetes.

Whether polyamines regulate other cell functions remains unclear. Here, we explore whether and how polyamines affect genome integrity. When DNA double-strand break (DSB) is induced in hair follicles by ionizing radiation, reduction of cellular polyamines augments dystrophic changes with delayed regeneration. Mechanistically, polyamines facilitate homologous recombination-mediated DSB repair without affecting repair via non-homologous DNA end-joining and single-strand DNA annealing. Biochemical reconstitution and functional analyses demonstrate that polyamines enhance the DNA strand exchange activity of RAD51 recombinase. The effect of polyamines on RAD51 stems from their ability to enhance the capture of homologous duplex DNA and synaptic complex formation by the RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament.

This activity is mediated by interaction with the taxane site of beta-tubulin, leading to microtubule stabilization and cell death. Although widely used in the treatment of breast cancer and other malignancies, existing taxane-based therapies including paclitaxel and the second-generation docetaxel are currently limited by severe adverse effects and dose-limiting toxicity. To discover taxane site modulators, we employ a computational binding site similarity screen of > 14,000 drug-like pockets from PDB, revealing an unexpected similarity between the estrogen receptor and the beta-tubulin taxane binding pocket. Evaluation of nine selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) via cellular and biochemical assays confirms taxane site interaction, microtubule stabilization, and cell proliferation inhibition. Our study demonstrates that SERMs can modulate microtubule assembly and raises the possibility of an estrogen receptor-independent mechanism for inhibiting cell proliferation. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Here we show that upon EGFR activation, 6PGD is phosphorylated at tyrosine (Y) 481 by Src family kinase Fyn. This phosphorylation enhances 6PGD activity by increasing its binding affinity to NADP + and therefore activates the PPP for NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate, which consequently detoxifies intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and accelerates DNA synthesis. Abrogating 6PGD Y481 phosphorylation (pY481) dramatically attenuates EGF-promoted glioma cell proliferation, tumor growth and resistance to ionizing radiation. In addition, 6PGD pY481 is associated with Fyn expression, the malignancy and prognosis of human glioblastoma. These findings establish a critical role of Fyn-dependent 6PGD phosphorylation in EGF-promoted tumor growth and radiation resistance. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Modern and precise radiotherapy techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, may prevent toxicity, but some patients still experience adverse effects. The physiopathology of toxicity is dependent on many parameters, such as the location of irradiation or the functional status of organs at risk. Knowledge of the mechanisms leads to a more rational approach for controlling radiotherapy toxicity, which may result in improved symptom control and quality of life for patients. This improved quality of life is particularly important in paediatric patients, who may live for many years with the long-term effects of radiotherapy.

Although CD133 also localises to the cytoplasm, the mechanism of action and function of cytoplasmic CD133 currently remain unknown. We herein demonstrated that when Src family kinase activity is weak, CD133 interacts with HDAC6 and is transported to the pericentrosomal region after internalization and endosome formation via the dynein-based traffic system. Pericentrosomal CD133 is then recycled to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes. At the pericentrosomal region, endosomal CD133 captures GABARAP, an initiator of autophagy, and inhibits GABARAP-mediated ULK1 activation and the subsequent initiation of autophagy. Furthermore, pericentrosomal CD133 suppresses cell differentiation, such as primary cilium formation and neurite outgrowth, by inhibiting autophagy.

We hypothesize that decreased expression of miR-148a in HCC may elevate transferrin-bound iron uptake, increasing cellular iron levels and cell proliferation. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

The host retains memory T cells specific for previous infections throughout the entire body that are capable of executing potent and immediate immunostimulatory functions. Here we show that virus-specific memory T cells extend their surveillance to mouse and human tumors. Reactivating these antiviral T cells can arrest growth of checkpoint blockade-resistant and poorly immunogenic tumors in mice after injecting adjuvant-free non-replicating viral peptides into tumors. Peptide mimics a viral reinfection event to memory CD8+ T cells, triggering antigen presentation and cytotoxic pathways within the tumor, activating dendritic cells and natural killer cells, and recruiting the adaptive immune system. Viral peptide treatment of ex vivo human tumors recapitulates immune activation gene expression profiles observed in mice. Lastly, peptide therapy renders resistant mouse tumors susceptible to PD-L1 blockade. Thus, re-stimulating known antiviral immunity may provide a unique therapeutic approach for cancer immunotherapy. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Its mis-regulation is associated to several human cancers that, consistently, can be treated by selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The proximal promoter of EGFR contains a G-rich domain located at 272 bases upstream the transcription start site. We previously proved it folds into two main interchanging G-quadruplex structures, one of parallel and one of hybrid topology. Here we present the first evidences supporting the ability of the complementary C-rich strand (EGFR-272_C) to assume an intramolecular i-Motif (iM) structure that, according to the experimental conditions (pH, presence of co-solvent and salts), can coexist with a different arrangement we referred to as a hairpin. The herein identified iM efficiently competes with the canonical pairing of the two complementary strands, indicating it as a potential novel target for anticancer therapies.

Intravital imaging shows that LSECs fluoresce within 20 s after intravenous injection of α-melittin-NPs. α-melittin-NPs trigger the activation of LSECs and lead to dramatic changes of cytokine/chemokine milieu in the liver, which switches the hepatic immunologic environment to the activated state. As a result, α-melittin-NPs resist the formation of metastatic lesions with high efficiency. More strikingly, the survival rate reaches 80% in the spontaneous liver metastatic tumor model.

The kinetochore-bound KMN network and the kinesin motor CENP-E are critical for kinetochore-microtubule attachment and chromosome stability. The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) attaches linear ubiquitin chains to substrates, with well-established roles in immune response. Here, we identify LUBAC as a key player of chromosome alignment during mitosis. LUBAC catalyzes linear ubiquitination of the kinetochore motor CENP-E, which is specifically required for the localization of CENP-E at attached kinetochores, but not unattached ones. KNL1 acts as a receptor of linear ubiquitin chains to anchor CENP-E at attached kinetochores in prometaphase and metaphase.

Over the years, oral care protocols and mouthwashes have been developed to control this problem. Recently, in some studies, the effect of oral care programs and honey on the nutritional status of patients under chemotherapy has been studied. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of honey mouthwash and an oral care protocol on weight loss in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergoing chemotherapy. Materials and Methods: In this single-blind clinical trial, sixty patients with AML under chemotherapy admitted to Ghazi Tabatabaee hospital of Tabriz, Iran were selected with convenience sampling and were randomly assigned into three groups: honey mouthwash (n=20) and oral care (n=20) and a control group (n=20). In addition to routine care, patients in the oral care group received twice daily toothbrush, dental floss was used once a day and normal saline mouthwash, and in the honey group, honey mouthwash was used four times a day for 30 seconds (honey to water ratio 1:20). The weight of patients was measured using a digital scale at baseline and at 4 weeks follow-up (4 times). Results: The trend of weight changes in the control group was decreasing; in the honey mouthwash group, after the first week was ascending, and in the oral care group, it was almost constant.Importantly,comparison of mean weight in the study groups during the first and second weeks was not significant (p>0.05) but at the end of the third week, the difference of mean weight of the patients in the honey and control group (p=0.039) and at the end of the week in the honey and control group (p=0.001) and honey and oral care (p=0.04) were significant. The effect of intervention of honey mouthwash was significant over time (p<0.01). Conclusion: The results of the study showed that honey mouthwash improved the weight of patients during the stay, while this trend was reversed in the other two groups. Considering the effectiveness of honey mouthwash and easy use, the using this mouthwash with oral hygiene education is recommended to improve nutritional indices of patients in cancer care units. © 2019, Semnan University of Medical Sciences.

Why and how did EPA and IARC reach such different conclusions? Results: A total of 52 genotoxicity assays done by registrants were cited by the EPA in its 2016 evaluation of technical glyphosate, and another 52 assays appeared in the public literature. Of these, one regulatory assay (2%) and 35 published assays (67%) reported positive evidence of a genotoxic response. In the case of formulated, glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs), 43 regulatory assays were cited by EPA, plus 65 assays published in peer-reviewed journals. Of these, none of the regulatory, and 49 published assays (75%) reported evidence of a genotoxic response following exposure to a GBH. IARC considered a total of 118 genotoxicity assays in six core tables on glyphosate technical, GBHs, and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), glyphosate’s primary metabolite. EPA’s analysis encompassed 51 of these 118 assays (43%). In addition, IARC analyzed another 81 assays exploring other possible genotoxic mechanisms (mostly related to sex hormones and oxidative stress), of which 62 (77%) reported positive results. IARC placed considerable weight on three positive GBH studies in exposed human populations, whereas EPA placed little or no weight on them. Conclusions: EPA and IARC reached diametrically opposed conclusions on glyphosate genotoxicity for three primary reasons: (1) in the core tables compiled by EPA and IARC, the EPA relied mostly on registrant-commissioned, unpublished regulatory studies, 99% of which were negative, while IARC relied mostly on peer-reviewed studies of which 70% were positive (83 of 118); (2) EPA’s evaluation was largely based on data from studies on technical glyphosate, whereas IARC’s review placed heavy weight on the results of formulated GBH and AMPA assays; (3) EPA’s evaluation was focused on typical, general population dietary exposures assuming legal, food-crop uses, and did not take into account, nor address generally higher occupational exposures and risks. IARC’s assessment encompassed data from typical dietary, occupational, and elevated exposure scenarios. More research is needed on real-world exposures to the chemicals within formulated GBHs and the biological fate and consequences of such exposures. © 2019, The Author(s).","Cancer; Co-formulants; Genotoxicity; Glyphosate; IARC; Occupational exposure; Regulation; Roundup; US EPA",Article,Scopus

It was established that the molecular weight of chitosan influenced the thermogelling, mucoadhesive and drug release behaviour of the in situ gelling delivery systems. Formulations prepared from chitosan with greatest molecular weight (370 kDa) were found to be the most promising for intravesical application due to their superior gelling properties and in vitro retention in the bladder. © 2019 The Author(s)","Chitosan; In situ gelling; Intravesical drug delivery; Mitomycin-C; Mucoadhesion; β-Glycerophosphate",Article,Scopus

Here, we examined the tumorogenic role of syntaxin 6 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was queried for clinicopathologic data and syntaxin 6 expression. We found a significant difference in overall survival (OS) between groups, with high syntaxin 6 expression correlating with decreased survival. When stratifying the data based on histological subtype, the papillary RCC subtype exhibited a significant correlation between syntaxin 6 expression and survival. Using ROC curve, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) to determine the ability of syntaxin 6 to predict 3-year overall survival. The AUC for syntaxin 6 was 0.73, significantly higher compared to 0.52 for T stage. Next, syntaxin 6 expression was evaluated in clear cell (786-O and Caki-1) and papillary (Caki-2 and ACHN) RCC cells. Syntaxin 6 expression was higher in Caki-1 and ACHN RCC cells. Silencing of syntaxin 6 in ACHN cells significantly decreased the cell viability (p < 0.001). Overall, syntaxin 6 could be a prognostic biomarker for patients with papillary RCC and syntaxin 6 inhibitors hold promise as a novel therapy against RCC. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

After the application of rigorous immunoinformatics analysis and several immune filters, the multi-epitope vaccine was constructed, consisting of CD4, CD8 and IFN-γ inducing epitopes. Several physiochemical characteristics, allergenicity and antigenicity of the multi-epitope vaccine were analyzed in order to ensure its safety and immunogenicity. Further, the binding affinity and stability of the vaccine with Toll like receptor -9 (TLR-9) was analyzed by molecular docking and dynamics simulation studies. In addition, an in silico cloning was performed to ensure the expression and translation efficiency of the vaccine, utilizing pET-28a (+) vector. Such T-cell-based immunotherapies which leverage this mechanism could prove their potential against cancer.

In the erythrocytes and endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier, glucose uptake is mediated by the glucose transporter type 1 (GluT1). GluT1 deficiency or mutations cause severe physiological disorders. GluT1 is also an important target in cancer therapy as it is overexpressed in tumor cells. Previous studies have suggested that GluT1 mediates solute transfer through a cycle of conformational changes. However, the corresponding 3D structures adopted by the transporter during the transfer process remain elusive. In the present work, we first elucidate the whole conformational landscape of GluT1 in the absence of glucose, using long molecular dynamics simulations and show that the transitions can be accomplished through thermal fluctuations. Importantly, we highlight a strong coupling between intracellular and extracellular domains of the protein that contributes to the transmembrane helices reorientation during the transition. The conformations adopted during the simulations differ from the known 3D bacterial homologs structures resolved in similar states. In holo state simulations, we find that glucose transits along the pathway through significant rotational motions, while maintaining hydrogen bonds with the protein. These persistent motions affect side chains orientation, which impacts protein mechanics and allows glucose progression. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Obese animals treated with ENOblock showed a reduction in body weight and increased core body temperature.

As an example, we identify 63 protein kinases exhibiting altered expression and/or phosphorylation in Src-transformed mammary epithelial cells. An integrated siRNA screen identifies nine kinases, including SGK1, as being essential for Src-induced transformation. Accordingly, we find that Src positively regulates SGK1 expression in triple negative breast cancer cells, which exhibit a prominent signalling network governed by Src family kinases. Furthermore, combined inhibition of Src and SGK1 reduces colony formation and xenograft growth more effectively than either treatment alone.

To circumvent this, the focus has shifted away from the ATPase domain. One option involves modulation of the protein through allosteric activation/inhibition. Here, we propose a novel approach: we use previously obtained information via residue perturbation scanning coupled with dynamic residue network analysis to identify allosteric drug targeting sites for inhibitor docking.

Mutations of MLL3 or MLL4 have been reported in different types of cancer. Recently, the PHD domains of MLL3/4 have been reported to recruit the MLL3/4 complexes to their target genes by binding to histone H4 during the NT2/D1 stem cell differentiation. Here we show that an extended PHD domain (ePHD 6 ) involving the sixth PHD domain and its preceding zinc finger in MLL3 and MLL4 specifically recognizes an H4H18-containing histone H4 fragment and that modifications of residues surrounding H4H18 modulate H4 binding to MLL3/4. Our in vitro methyltransferase assays and cellular experiments further reveal that the interaction between ePHD 6 of MLL3/4 and histone H4 is required for their nucleosomal methylation activity and MLL4-mediated neuronal differentiation of NT2/D1 cells. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Therefore, highly priced berry fruits might be targets for food adulteration and fraud. In this study, eight species-specific primer sets based on the single nucleotide polymorphism of the chloroplast genomes of four berry fruits (aronia, blackberry, cranberry, and strawberry) were developed for quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis by SYBR Green staining with the aim of preventing berry fruit food fraud. The developed primer pairs exhibited high efficiencies ranging from 88 to 110% with strong correlation coefficients (R 2 &gt; 0.99) for the amplification of each target species. However, no clear correlation coefficients were evident for non-target species. To evaluate the practicality of the developed primers, 18 commercial berry fruit products were verified by qPCR analysis. The developed primer pairs were amplified to a low C t value (range 16.1–23.3) for the target species and proved capable of detecting target species in berry fruit commercial foods.

Recent data show that SOX6 expression is altered in different cancers, in the majority of cases being downregulated. To date, no data are available about SOX6 role in hematological malignancies. Here we demonstrate that SOX6 overexpressing BCR-ABL1 + B-ALL cells are unable to promote leukemia in a mouse model. Starting from this observation, we extended our study to a panel of human leukemic cells carrying genetic lesions distinctive of different types of leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders (the BCR-ABL1 translocation and the JAK2V617F amino acid substitution) to dissect the cellular events induced by SOX6. The inhibition of proliferation is the invariant outcome of SOX6 overexpression but it is achieved via two different cellular responses: terminal differentiation in erythroid-biased cells, irrespectively of their mutation, and apoptosis in megakaryocytic-primed and lymphoid cells. Within this context, cells carrying the highest copy number of the JAK2V617F allele better counteract the SOX6-imposed growth arrest.

Toll like receptors (TLRs) provide a link between innate and adaptive immune responses and hence potentially correlate inflammation to cancer. Although the regulatory role of TLRs in MM has been under investigation the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study we assayed the function of TLR4 in MM cell lines and in MM patients’ samples. We found that lipopolysaccharide-mediated TLR4 activation increased MM cells proliferation and decreased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we observed that either the endogenous CHOP expression or the ER stress-mediated CHOP induction, were suppressed by TLR4 activation or its overexpression in MM cell lines; TLR4 induction also suppressed ER stress-induced apoptotic signals. In support, TLR4 gene expression silencing in MM cell lines significantly decreased cell proliferation and promoted CHOP and ATF4 upregulation. TLR4 activation was also able to partially abrogate the effect of bortezomib in MM cell lines by suppressing PERK, ATF4 and phospho-eIF2A. We suggest that TLR4-mediated disruption of ER stress responses contributes to MM cells proliferation and suppresses ER-dependent death signals. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

The RCC GCN contains binary gene coexpression relationships (edges) specific to conditions including RCC subtype and tumor stage. As an application of this resource, we discovered RCC GCN edges and modules that were associated with genetic lesions in known RCC driver genes, including VHL, a common initiating clear cell RCC (ccRCC) genetic lesion, and PBRM1 and BAP1 which are early genetic lesions in the Braided Cancer River Model (BCRM). Since ccRCC tumors with PBRM1 mutations respond to targeted therapy differently than tumors with BAP1 mutations, we focused on ccRCC-specific edges associated with tumors that exhibit alternate mutation profiles: VHL-PBRM1 or VHL-BAP1. We found specific blends molecular functions associated with these two mutation paths. Despite these mutation-associated edges having unique genes, they were enriched for the same immunological functions suggesting a convergent functional role for alternate gene sets consistent with the BCRM.

However, dPCR exhibits large fluctuations in the fluorescence intensity of the compartment, resulting in low accuracy. The main cause is most likely due to insufficient PCR. In this study, we proposed a new method that combines dPCR with melting curve analysis and applied that method to KRAS genotyping. Since the melting temperature (Tm) of the PCR product hardly depends on the amplification efficiency, genotyping accuracy is improved by using the Tm value. The results showed that the peaks of the distribution of the Tm values of DNA in the wells were 68.7, 66.3, and 62.6 °C for wild-type KRAS, the G12R mutant, and the G12D mutant, respectively, and the standard deviation of the Tm values was 0.2 °C for each genotype. This result indicates that the proposed method is capable of discriminating between the wild-type sequence and the two mutants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the genotyping of single mutations by combining melting curve analysis and dPCR.

The univariate and multivariate regression models were utilized to assess the relative contribution of each gene to survival prediction in both cohorts, and the common genes in two cohorts were identified as a final prognostic model. A prognostic risk score was calculated based on the prognostic gene signature. This prognostic signature stratified the patients into the low- and high-risk groups. Multivariate regression and stratification analyses were implemented to determine whether the gene signature was an independent prognostic factor. We identified a 6-gene signature through univariate and multivariate regression models.

IRSp53 generates dynamic (extending and retracting) filopodia 300 nm wide with a distinct gap between IRSp53 and F-actin. By contrast, protrusions induced by the I-BAR domain alone are non-dynamic measuring between 100–200 nm in width and exhibit a comparatively closer localisation of the I-BAR domain with the F-actin. The data suggest that IRSp53 membrane localisation is spatially segregated to the lateral edges of filopodia, in contrast to the I-BAR domain is uniformly distributed throughout the membranes of protrusions.

While the cellular and molecular systems that regulate tip versus stalk endothelial cell (EC) specification during angiogenesis are known, those systems that regulate their distinct actions remain poorly understood. Pre-clinical and clinical findings support sustained adrenergic signaling in promoting angiogenesis, but links between adrenergic signaling and angiogenesis are lacking; importantly, adrenergic agents alter the activation status of the cAMP signaling system. Here, we show that the cAMP effector, PKA, acts in a cell autonomous fashion to constitutively reduce the in vitro and ex vivo angiogenic sprouting capacity of ECs. At a cellular level, we observed that silencing or inhibiting PKA in human ECs increased their invasive capacity, their generation of podosome rosettes and, consequently, their ability to degrade a collagen matrix. While inhibition of either Src-family kinases or of cdc42 reduced these events in control ECs, only cdc42 inhibition, or silencing, significantly impacted them in PKA(Cα)-silenced ECs. Consistent with these findings, cell-based measurements of cdc42 activity revealed that PKA activation inhibits EC cdc42 activity, at least in part, by promoting its interaction with the inhibitory regulator, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor-α (RhoGDIα). © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

The detection of targets for phagocytosis is directed by a complex repertoire of cell surface receptors. Pattern recognition receptors directly detect targets for binding and uptake, while opsonic and complement receptors detect objects coated by soluble factors. However, the importance of single and combinatorial surface marker expression across different phenotypes of professional phagocytes is not known. Here we developed a novel mass cytometry-based phagocytosis assay that enables the simultaneous detection of phagocytic events in combination with up to 40 other protein markers. We applied this assay to distinct monocyte derived macrophage (MDM) populations and found that prototypic M2-like MDMs phagocytose more E. coli than M1-like MDMs. Surface markers such as CD14, CD206, and CD163 rendered macrophages phagocytosis competent, but only CD209 directly correlated with the amount of particle uptake. Similarly, M2-like MDMs also phagocytosed more cancer cells than M1-like MDMs but, unlike M1-like MDMs, were insensitive to anti-CD47 opsonization.

In this study, we investigated the effects of low PRMT1 levels on a non-MYCN amplified neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line. Stable PRMT1-knockdown (PRMT1-KD) cells showed reduced growth rates and cell cycle arrest at G 2 /M. They also exhibited senescent phenotypes and increased p53 expression. p21 and PAI-1, which are two p53 downstream targets critical for senescence, were significantly induced in SK-N-SH cells subjected to either PRMT1-KD or inhibitor treatment. The induction was suppressed by a p53 inhibitor and marginal in a p53-null SK-N-AS cell line, suggesting dependence on p53. In general, the DNA damage and ROS levels of the PRMT1-KD SK-N-SH cells were slightly increased. Their migration activity also increased with the induction of PAI-1. Thus, PRMT1 downregulation released the repression of cellular senescence and migration activity in SK-N-SH cells.

Using a combination of computational methods, we defined a minimal common pharmacophore in established CDC25 inhibitors and performed virtual screening of a proprietary library. Based on the availability of crystal structures for CDC25A and CDC25B, we implemented a molecular docking strategy and carried out hit expansion/optimization. Enzymatic assays revealed that naphthoquinone scaffolds were the most promising CDC25 inhibitors among selected hits. At the molecular level, the compounds acted through a mixed-type mechanism of inhibition of phosphatase activity, involving reversible oxidation of cysteine residues. In 2D cell cultures, the compounds caused arrest of the cell cycle at the G1/S or at the G2/M transition. Mitotic markers analysis and time-lapse microscopy confirmed that CDK1 activity was impaired and that mitotic arrest was followed by death. Finally, the compounds induced differentiation, accompanied by decreased stemness properties, in intestinal crypt stem cell-derived Apc/K-Ras-mutant mouse organoids, and led to tumor regression and reduction of metastatic potential in zebrafish embryo xenografts used as in vivo model. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

To uncover these genomic events in an HPV infection, we have developed an innovative and cost-effective sequencing approach named TaME-seq (tagmentation-assisted multiplex PCR enrichment sequencing). TaME-seq combines tagmentation and multiplex PCR enrichment for simultaneous analysis of HPV variation and chromosomal integration, and it can also be adapted to other viruses. For method validation, cell lines (n = 4), plasmids (n = 3), and HPV16, 18, 31, 33 and 45 positive clinical samples (n = 21) were analysed. Our results showed deep HPV genome-wide sequencing coverage. Chromosomal integration breakpoints and large deletions were identified in HPV positive cell lines and in one clinical sample. HPV genomic variability was observed in all samples allowing identification of low frequency variants. In contrast to other approaches, TaME-seq proved to be highly efficient in HPV target enrichment, leading to reduced sequencing costs. Comprehensive studies on HPV intra-host variability generated during a persistent infection will improve our understanding of viral carcinogenesis. Efficient identification of both HPV variability and integration sites will be important for the study of HPV evolution and adaptability and may be an important tool for use in cervical cancer diagnostics. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Whereas, it is unknown whether MEG3 regulates the growth of cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the specific role of MEG3 in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy. Here, we found that MEG3 contributed to the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. MEG3 expression was remarkably strengthened in the mice heart which undergone the transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis revealed that MEG3 was upregulated in the cardiomyocytes which were treated with Ang-II. Silenced MEG3 inhibited the increasing size of hypertrophic cardiomyocytes and reversed other hypertrophic responses. Mechanically, MEG3 could affect cardiac hypertrophy by regulating gene expression. Mechanically, we found that MEG3 could be upregulated by the transcription factor STAT3 and could regulate miR-361-5p and HDAC9 by acting as a ceRNA. Finally, rescue assays were made to do further confirmation.

We therefore investigated 18 combinations of image perturbations to determine feature robustness, based on noise addition (N), translation (T), rotation (R), volume growth/shrinkage (V) and supervoxel-based contour randomisation (C).

Most of the fusions result in out-of-frame transcripts, potentially capable of producing long novel protein sequences and a plethora of neoantigens. To identify fusions, we explored RNA-sequencing data to obtain detailed knowledge of transcribed fusions, by creating a novel program to compare fusions identified by deFuse to de novo transcripts generated by Trinity. This allowed us to confirm the deFuse results and identify unusual splicing patterns associated with fusion events. Using various existing tools combined with this custom program, we developed a pipeline for the identification of fusion transcripts applicable as targets for immunotherapy. In addition to identifying candidate neoantigens associated with fusions, we were able to use the pipeline to establish a method for measuring the frequency of fusion events, which correlated to patient outcome, as well as highlight some similarities between canine and human osteosarcomas.

The activation of the pathway has been linked to PPARG gains/amplifications resulting in PPARγ overexpression and to recurrent activating point mutations of RXRα. Here, we report recurrent mutations of PPARγ that also activate the PPARγ/RXRα pathway, conferring PPARγ-dependency and supporting a crucial role of PPARγ in luminal bladder cancer.

This classifier could successfully discriminate patients with distinct prognoses in the training and validation (REMBRANDT, GSE16011 and TCGA-GBM Microarray) cohorts (P < 0.05 in all cohorts) and in different clinicopathological subgroups.

We postulated that, in prostate cancer (PCa) cells, augmented lipogenesis and growth are due to increased DGAT1 expression leading to microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) amplification. Thus, therapeutic targeting of DGAT1 potentially has tumor suppressive activity. We tested whether blocking DGAT1 in PCa cells altered MTOC and lipid signaling. Western blot and immunofluorescence were performed for MTOC and triglyceride mediators. Treatment with a DGAT1 inhibitor was evaluated. We found a stepwise increase in DGAT1 protein levels when comparing normal prostate epithelial cells to PCa cells, LNCaP and PC-3.

On the other hand, serum-containing medium (SCM) is not recommended very much because the secretome obtained with SCM is easily contaminated with fetal bovine serum (FBS) proteins. In this study, through the combination of bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) and pulsed-SILAC (pSILAC), we analyzed differentially secreted proteins between SFM and SCM in a cancer-derived human cell, U87MG, and a mesenchymal stem cell derived from human Wharton’s jelly (hWJ-MSCs). In most cases, the bioinformatic tools predicted a protein to be truly secretory when the secretion level of the protein was more in SCM than in SFM. In the case of hWJ-MSCs, the amount of proteins secreted in SCM for 24 hours was larger than that of SFM (log 2 fold change = 0.96), even considering different cell proliferation rates. hWJ-MSCs proteins secreted more in SCM included several positive markers of MSC paracrine factors implicated in angiogenesis, neurogenesis and osteogenesis, and upstream regulators of cell proliferation. Our study suggests the analysis of the secretome should be processed in SCM that promotes cell proliferation and secretion. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Recently, Adnectin C has attracted attention for cancer treatment. To overcome the problematic properties of Adnectin, a novel form of Adnectin C has been designed by its fusion to a biodegradable polymeric peptide containing Pro/Ala/Ser (PAS) repetitive residues. E. coli-expressed recombinant fused and unfused proteins were compared in terms of bioactivity, physicochemical, and pharmacokinetic properties using standard methods. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis of PASylated adnectin C revealed an approximate 2-fold increase in particle size with a slight change in the net charge. Additionally, fusion of the PAS sequence improved its stability against the growth of thermo-induced aggregated forms. The high receptor-binding and improved binding kinetic parameters of PASylated Adnectin C was confirmed by ELISA and surface plasmon resonance assays, respectively. Pharmacokinetic studies showed a noticeable increase in the terminal half-life of Adnectin C-PAS#1(200) by a factor of 4.57 after single dose by intravenous injection into female BALB/c mice.

However, the role of TRPV1 in the maintenance of neuropathic pain remains elusive. The current study investigated the effects of transient Trpv1 gene silencing using a small interference RNA (siRNA) on neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve in rats. Seven days after CCI, the TRPV1 siRNA was intrathecally administered (5 µg/15 µl, once daily for 2 days). TRPV1 and Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII) expression and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in the spinal cord were detected using western blotting. The thresholds to mechanical and thermal stimuli were determined before and after intrathecal TRPV1 siRNA administration. TRPV1 and CAMKII expression and ERK2 phosphorylation in the spinal cord were upregulated after CCI. Intrathecal administration of the TRPV1 siRNA not only attenuated behavioural hyperalgesia but also reduced the expression of TRPV1 and CAMKII, as well as ERK2 phosphorylation. Based on these results, silencing of the TRPV1 gene in the spinal cord attenuates the maintenance of neuropathic pain by inhibiting CAMKII/ERK2 activation and suggests that TRPV1 represents a potential target in pain therapy. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

AMP activated kinase (AMPK) constitutes a candidate to inhibit HCC progression. First, AMPK is downregulated in HCC. Second, glucose starvation induces apoptosis in HCC cells via AMPK. Correspondingly, metformin activates AMPK and inhibits HCC cell proliferation. Nevertheless, the effect of AMPK activation on HCC cell invasiveness remains elusive. Here, migration/invasion was studied in HCC cells exposed to metformin and glucose starvation. Cell viability, proliferation and differentiation, as well as AMPK and PKA activation were analyzed. In addition, invasiveness in mutants of the AMPKα activation loop was assessed. Metformin decreased cell migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and interference with AMPKα expression avoided metformin actions. Those antitumor effects were potentiated by glucose deprivation. Metformin activated AMPK at the same time that inhibited PKA, and both effects were enhanced by glucose starvation. Given that AMPKα(S173) phosphorylation by PKA decreases AMPK activation, we hypothesized that the reduction of PKA inhibitory effect by metformin could explain the increased antitumor effects observed. Supporting this, in AMPK activating conditions, cell migration/invasion was further impaired in AMPKα(S173C) mutant cells. Metformin emerges as a strong inhibitor of migration/invasion in HCC cells, and glucose restriction potentiates this effect. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

An inherent limitation of this bulk RNA-seq data is that tumour samples consist of a varying mixture of cancerous and non-cancerous cells, which influences differential gene expression analyses. Here, we investigate whether the drug repositioning candidates are expected to target the genes dysregulated in ccRCC cells by studying the association with tumour purity. When all ccRCC samples are analysed together, the drug repositioning potential of identified drugs start decreasing above 80% estimated tumour purity. Because ccRCC is a highly vascular tumour, attributed to frequent loss of VHL function and subsequent activation of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF), we stratified the samples by observed activation of the HIF-pathway. After stratification, the association between estimated tumour purity and drug repositioning potential disappears for HIF-activated samples. This result suggests that the identified drug repositioning candidates specifically target the genes expressed by HIF-activated ccRCC tumour cells, instead of genes expressed by other cell types part of the tumour micro-environment. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Potent galectin-3 inhibitors have been synthesized, for experimental purposes and potential clinical use. As galectin-3 is implicated in both intra- and extracellular activities, permeability of galectin-3 inhibitors is an important parameter determining biological effects. We compared the cellular uptake of galectin-3 inhibitors and their potency in the intracellular or extracellular space. The inhibitors differed in their polar surface area (PSA), but had similar affinities for galectin-3. Using a well-established permeability assay, we confirmed that the uptake was significantly higher for the inhibitor with the lowest PSA, as expected. To analyze intracellular activity of the inhibitors, we developed a novel assay based on galectin-3 accumulation around damaged intracellular vesicles. The results show striking differences between the inhibitors intracellular potency, correlating with their PSAs. To test extracellular activity of the inhibitors, we analyzed their potency to block binding of galectin-3 to cell surfaces. All inhibitors were equally able to block galectin-3 binding to cells and this was proportional to their affinity for galectin-3.

Different tissue types that neurosurgeons should clearly distinguish during surgery, such as the cortex, white matter, necrosis and tumorous tissue, were separately analyzed. Based on volumetric CP OCT data, tumorous and normal brain tissue were differentiated using two optical coefficients — attenuation and forward cross-scattering. Compared with white matter, tumorous tissue without necrotic areas had significantly lower optical attenuation and forward cross-scattering values. The presence of particular morphological patterns, such as necrosis and injured myelinated fibers, can lead to dramatic changes in coefficient values and create some difficulties in differentiating between tissues. Color-coded CP OCT maps based on optical coefficients provided a visual assessment of the tissue.

Therefore, targeted detection of these variations is of high importance for early diagnosis and (familial) screenings. While allele-specific PCR has been around for many years, its adoption for SNP genotyping or somatic mutation detection has been hampered by its low discriminating power and high costs. To tackle this, we developed a cost-effective qPCR based method, able to detect SNPs in a robust and specific manner. This study describes how to combine the basic principles of allele-specific PCR (the combination of a wild type and variant primer) with the straightforward readout of DNA-binding dye based qPCR technology. To enhance the robustness and discriminating power, an artificial mismatch in the allele-specific primer was introduced. The resulting method, called double-mismatch allele-specific qPCR (DMAS-qPCR), was successfully validated using 12 SNPs and 15 clinically relevant somatic mutations on 48 cancer cell lines. It is easy to use, does not require labeled probes and is characterized by high analytical sensitivity and specificity.

For this purpose, a tumor suppressor miRNA (miR-198), deregulated in several human cancer types, was chosen as the model oligonucleotide. Magnetite nanoparticles carrying the complementary sequence of miR-198 (miR-198 antisense) on their surface were delivered into cells and subsequently used for the extracellular transport of miRNA and proteins.

Wnt signaling hyperactivation is predominantly caused by loss-of-function mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene that encodes the pathway negative regulator. In order to identify genes affected by the Apc loss, we performed expression profiling of intestinal epithelium isolated from mice harboring a conditional Apc allele. The gene encoding transcriptional factor msh homeobox 1 (Msx1) displayed robust upregulation upon Apc inactivation. Histological analysis of the Apc-deficient epithelium revealed that in the small intestine, the Msx1 protein was localized exclusively in ectopic crypts, i.e., in pockets of proliferating cells abnormally positioned on the villi. Ablation of the Msx1 gene leads to the disappearance of ectopic crypts and loss of differentiated cells. Moreover, tumors arising from Msx1-deficient cells display altered morphology reminiscent of villous adenomas. In human tumor specimens, MSX1 displayed significantly increased expression in colonic neoplasia with a descending tendency during the lesion progression towards colorectal carcinoma. In summary, the results indicate that Msx1 represents a novel marker of intestinal tumorigenesis.

The impact of estrogen signaling on the immune system is most often studied in terms of the nuclear estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ. However, the potential contribution of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) to innate defense against infectious disease, particularly with respect to skin infection, has not been addressed. Using a murine model of SSTI, we found that GPER activation with the highly selective agonist G-1 limits S. aureus SSTI and Hla-mediated pathogenesis, effects that were absent in GPER knockout mice. Specifically, G-1 reduced Hla-mediated skin lesion formation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, while increasing bacterial clearance. In vitro, G-1 reduced surface expression of the Hla receptor, ADAM10, in a human keratinocyte cell line and increased resistance to Hla-mediated permeability barrier disruption. This novel role for GPER activation in skin innate defense against infectious disease suggests that G-1 may have clinical utility in patients with epithelial permeability barrier dysfunction or who are otherwise at increased risk of S. aureus infection, including those with atopic dermatitis or cancer. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

We conducted for the first time a large-scale differential multi-omics investigation on DLBCL patient’s samples in order to identify new biomarkers that could early identify patients at risk of R/R disease and to identify new targets that could determine chemorefractoriness. We compared a well-characterized cohort of R/R versus chemosensitive DLBCL patients by combining label-free quantitative proteomics and targeted RNA sequencing performed on the same tissues samples. The cross-section of both data levels allowed extracting a sub-list of 22 transcripts/proteins pairs whose expression levels significantly differed between the two groups of patients. In particular, we identified significant targets related to tumor metabolism (Hexokinase 3), microenvironment (IDO1, CXCL13), cancer cells proliferation, migration and invasion (S100 proteins) or BCR signaling pathway (CD79B). Overall, this study revealed several extremely promising biomarker candidates related to DLBCL chemorefractoriness and highlighted some new potential therapeutic drug targets.

Its levels are tightly regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2. The complex between MDM2 and p53 is largely formed by the interaction between the N-terminal domain of MDM2 and the N-terminal transactivation (TA) domain of p53 (residues 15–29). We investigated the kinetic and thermodynamic basis of the MDM2/p53 interaction by using wild-type and mutant variants of the TA domain. We focus on the effects of phosphorylation at positions Thr18 and Ser20 including their substitution with phosphomimetics. Conformational propensities of the isolated peptides were investigated using in silico methods and experimentally by circular dichroism and 1H-NMR in aqueous solution. Both experimental and computational analyses indicate that the p53 peptides are mainly disordered in aqueous solution, with evidence of nascent helix around the Ser20-Leu25 region. Both phosphorylation and the phosphomimetics at Thr18 result in a decrease in the binding affinity by ten- to twenty-fold when compared to the wild-type. Phosphorylation and phosphomimetics at Ser20 result in a smaller decrease in the affinity. Mutation of Lys24 and Leu25 also disrupts the interaction.

The shelterin complex (POT1, TRF1, TRF2, Tin2, Rap1, and POT1 and TPP1) plays an important role in maintaining telomere length and integrity, and any alteration in telomeres may activate DNA damage response (DDR) machinery resulting in telomere attrition. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of silica exposure on the regulation of the shelterin complex in an animal model.

Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), normally expressed in germinal centre activated B-cells, is an enzyme that edits DNA/RNA and induces somatic hypermutation and Ig class switching. AID expression is strictly controlled under physiological conditions; however, chronic inflammation and some infectious agents induce its up-regulation. AID is overexpressed in various cancers and may be important in chronic inflammation-associated oncogenesis. We examined AID expression in IgG4-related sialadenitis (n = 14), sialolithiasis (non-specific inflammation, n = 13), and normal submandibular glands (n = 13) using immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Immunohistochemistry revealed significantly more AID-expressing cells in IgG4-related sialadenitis than in sialolithiasis or normal submandibular gland samples (P = 0.02 and P < 0.01, respectively); qPCR yielded similar results. Thus, AID was significantly more up-regulated and had higher expression in extra-germinal centres in IgG4-RD than in non-specific inflammation or normal conditions.

Several lines of evidence have shown a close correlation between increased H2S production and human diseases, such as several cancer types and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Identifying compounds selectively and potently inhibiting the human H2S-synthesizing enzymes may therefore prove beneficial for pharmacological applications. Here, the human enzymes CBS, CSE and MST were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, and thirty-one pyridine derivatives were synthesized and screened for their ability to bind and inhibit these enzymes. Using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), circular dichroism spectropolarimetry (CD), and activity assays based on fluorimetric and colorimetric H2S detection, two compounds (C30 and C31) sharing structural similarities were found to weakly inhibit both CBS and CSE: 1 mM C30 inhibited these enzymes by approx. 50% and 40%, respectively, while 0.5 mM C31 accounted for CBS and CSE inhibition by approx. 40% and 60%, respectively.

First, an association study revealed that the Pro variant of the TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and the G allele of the MDM2 SNP309 were associated with t-MN risk. The Arg variant of TP53 is more efficient at inducing apoptosis, whereas the Pro variant is a more potent inductor of cell cycle arrest and DNA repair.

Second, to evaluate the biological effect of the TP53 polymorphism, we established Jurkat isogenic cell lines expressing p53Arg or p53Pro. Jurkat p53Arg cells presented higher DNA damage and higher apoptotic potential than p53Pro cells, after treatment with chemotherapy agents.

However, under such a condition how glutamine nitrogen is disposed to avoid over-accumulating ammonia remains to be determined. Here we identify a metabolic flux of glutamine to secretory dihydroorotate, which is indispensable to glutamine-carbon metabolism under hypoxia. We found that glutamine nitrogen is necessary to nucleotide biosynthesis, but enriched in dihyroorotate and orotate rather than processing to its downstream uridine monophosphate under hypoxia. Dihyroorotate, not orotate, is then secreted out of cells. Furthermore, we found that the specific metabolic pathway occurs in vivo and is required for tumor growth. The identified metabolic pathway renders glutamine mainly to acetyl coenzyme A for lipogenesis, with the rest carbon and nitrogen being safely removed. Therefore, our results reveal how glutamine carbon and nitrogen are coordinatively metabolized under hypoxia, and provide a comprehensive understanding on glutamine metabolism. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

We hypothesized that “non-mutated” splicing regulators may also play a role in AML biology and therefore conducted an in vivo shRNA screen in a mouse model of CEBPA mutant AML. This has led to the identification of the splicing regulator RBM25 as a novel tumor suppressor. In multiple human leukemic cell lines, knockdown of RBM25 promotes proliferation and decreases apoptosis. Mechanistically, we show that RBM25 controls the splicing of key genes, including those encoding the apoptotic regulator BCL-X and the MYC inhibitor BIN1. This mechanism is also operative in human AML patients where low RBM25 levels are associated with high MYC activity and poor outcome. Thus, we demonstrate that RBM25 acts as a regulator of MYC activity and sensitizes cells to increased MYC levels. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

ADT-induced hypogonadism was reported to have the potential to lead to acute kidney injury (AKI). ADT was also shown to induce bladder fibrosis via induction of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β level. We hypothesized that Bic can likely induce renal fibrosis. To understand this, a cell model was used to explore expressions of relevant profibrotic proteins. Results indicated that Bic initiated multiple apoptotic and fibrotic pathways, including androgen deprivation, downregulation of the androgen receptor → phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase → Akt pathway, upregulation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway- tumor necrosis factor α → nuclear factor κB → caspase-3, increased expressions of fibrosis-related proteins including platelet-derived growth factor β, fibronectin and collagen IV, and enhanced cell migration. The endoplasmic reticular stress pathway and smooth muscle actin were unaffected by Bic. Co-treatment with testosterone was shown to have an anti-apoptotic effect against Bic, suggesting a better outcome of Bic therapy if administered with an appropriate testosterone intervention. However, since Bic was found to inhibit the membrane transport and consumption rates of testosterone, a slightly larger dose of testosterone is recommended.

The average particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, and drug loading of the optimized FA-SRF-BSANPs were 158.00 nm, -16.27 mV, 77.25%, and 7.73%, respectively.

Whereas much of that focus has been on the direct effect of chemotherapy drugs on immune cells and the release of antigens and danger signals by malignant cells killed by chemotherapy, the effect of chemotherapy on cells surviving treatment has often been overlooked. In the present study, tumour cell lines: A549 (lung), HCT116 (colon) and MCF-7 (breast), were treated with various concentrations of the chemotherapeutic drugs cyclophosphamide, gemcitabine (GEM) and oxaliplatin (OXP) for 24 hours in vitro. In line with other reports, GEM and OXP upregulated expression of the death receptor CD95 (fas) on live cells even at sub-cytotoxic concentrations. Further investigation revealed that the increase in CD95 in response to GEM sensitised the cells to fas ligand treatment, was associated with increased phosphorylation of stress activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase and that other death receptors and activatory immune receptors were co-ordinately upregulated with CD95 in certain cell lines. The upregulation of death receptors and NKG2D ligands together on cells after chemotherapy suggest that although the cells have survived preliminary treatment with chemotherapy they may now be more susceptible to immune cell-mediated challenge. This re-enforces the idea that chemotherapy-immunotherapy combinations may be useful clinically and has implications for the make-up and scheduling of such treatments. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

We assessed whether radiomic features extracted from baseline PET scans predicted relapsed or refractory disease status in a cohort of 251 patients with stage I-II HL who were managed at a tertiary cancer center. Models were developed and tested using a machine-learning algorithm. Features extracted from mediastinal sites were highly predictive of primary refractory disease.

Furthermore, among the patients with refractory mediastinal disease, our model distinguished those who were successfully salvaged from those who ultimately died of HL.

For FA patients, gene editing holds promise for therapeutic applications aimed at functionally restoring mutated genes in hematopoietic stem cells. However, intrinsic FA DNA repair defects may obstruct gene editing feasibility. Here, we report on the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated correction of a disruptive mutation in Fancf. Our experiments revealed that gene editing could effectively restore Fancf function via error-prone end joining resulting in a 27% increased survival in the presence of mitomycin C. In addition, templated gene correction could be achieved after double strand or single strand break formation. Although templated gene editing efficiencies were low (≤6%), FA corrected embryonic stem cells acquired a strong proliferative advantage over non-corrected cells, even without imposing genotoxic stress. Notably, Cas9 nickase activity resulted in mono-allelic gene editing and avoidance of undesired mutagenesis. In conclusion: DNA repair defects associated with FANCF deficiency do not prohibit CRISPR/Cas9 gene correction. Our data provide a solid basis for the application of pre-clinical models to further explore the potential of gene editing against FA, with the eventual aim to obtain therapeutic strategies against bone marrow failure. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

However, most GSK3 inhibitors lack specificity for GSK3α over GSK3β and other kinases. We have previously shown in lung cancer cells that GSK3α and to a lesser extent GSK3β are inhibited by the advanced clinical candidate tivantinib (ARQ197), which was designed as a MET inhibitor. Thus, we hypothesized that tivantinib would be an effective therapy for the treatment of AML. Here, we show that tivantinib has potent anticancer activity across several AML cell lines and primary patient cells. Tivantinib strongly induced apoptosis, differentiation and G2/M cell cycle arrest and caused less undesirable stabilization of β-catenin compared to the pan-GSK3 inhibitor LiCl. Subsequent drug combination studies identified the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 to synergize with tivantinib while cytarabine combination with tivantinib was antagonistic. Interestingly, the addition of ABT-199 to tivantinib completely abrogated tivantinib induced β-catenin stabilization. Tivantinib alone, or in combination with ABT-199, downregulated anti-apoptotic MCL-1 and BCL-XL levels, which likely contribute to the observed synergy. Importantly, tivantinib as single agent or in combination with ABT-199 significantly inhibited the colony forming capacity of primary patient AML bone marrow mononuclear cells. In summary, tivantinib is a novel GSK3α/β inhibitor that potently kills AML cells and tivantinib single agent or combination therapy with ABT-199 may represent attractive new therapeutic opportunities for AML. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

The β-HB-to-AcAc ratio is therefore expected to reflect mitochondrial redox. Previous studies reported the potential of hyperpolarized 13 C-AcAc to monitor mitochondrial redox in cells, perfused organs and in vivo. However, the ability of hyperpolarized 13 C-AcAc to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and its potential to monitor brain metabolism remained unknown. Our goal was to assess the value of hyperpolarized [1,3- 13 C 2 ]AcAc in healthy and tumor-bearing mice in vivo. Following hyperpolarized [1,3- 13 C 2 ]AcAc injection, production of [1,3- 13 C 2 ]β-HB was detected in normal and tumor-bearing mice.

These results were consistent with decreased BDH activity in tumors and associated with increased total cellular NAD + /NADH.

SOX9 is a transcription factor that plays a key role in these processes in foregut tissues. We report the biochemistry and tissue expression of the GCTM-5 antigen, a pancreatic cancer marker related to, but distinct from, CA19-9. This antigen, defined by two monoclonal antibodies recognising separate epitopes on a large glycoconjugate protein complex, is co-expressed with SOX9 by foregut ductal progenitors in the developing human liver and pancreas, and in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. These progenitors are distinct from cell populations identified by DCLK1, LGR5, or canonical markers of liver and pancreatic progenitor cells. Co-expression of this antigen complex and SOX9 also characterises the ductal metaplasia of submucosal glands that occurs during the development of Barrett’s oesophagus. The GCTM-5 antigen complex can be detected in the sera of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The GCTM-5 epitope shows a much more restricted pattern of expression in the normal adult pancreas relative to CA19-9.

The goal of the current study was to determine the effects that exposure of gestating female rats to vinclozolin has on the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of prostate disease, and to characterize by what molecular epigenetic mechanisms this has occurred. Gestating female rats (F0 generation) were exposed to vinclozolin during E8-E14 of gestation. F1 generation offspring were bred to produce the F2 generation, which were bred to produce the transgenerational F3 generation. The transgenerational F3 generation vinclozolin lineage males at 12 months of age had an increased incidence of prostate histopathology and abnormalities compared to the control lineage. Ventral prostate epithelial and stromal cells were isolated from F3 generation 20-day old rats, prior to the onset of pathology, and used to obtain DNA and RNA for analysis. Results indicate that there were transgenerational changes in gene expression, noncoding RNA expression, and DNA methylation in both cell types. Our results suggest that ancestral exposure to vinclozolin at a critical period of gestation induces the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of prostate stromal and epithelial cell changes in both the epigenome and transcriptome that ultimately lead to prostate disease susceptibility and may serve as a source of the increased incidence of prostate pathology observed in recent years. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Mutations in Ras and Raf are associated with a variety of cancers and genetic disorders. Of the three Raf isoforms, cRaf is most frequently involved in tumor initiation by Ras. Cytosolic Raf is auto-inhibited and becomes active upon recruitment to the plasma membrane. Since the catalytic domain of Raf is its kinase domain, we ask the following: does the kinase domain of Raf has potential to interact with membrane and if yes, what role does the membrane interaction play? We present a model of cRaf kinase domain in complex with a heterogeneous membrane bilayer using atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. We show that the kinase domain of cRaf has three distinct membrane-interacting regions: a polybasic motif (R.RKTR) from the regulatory αC-helix, an aromatic/hydrophobic cluster from the N-terminal acidic region (NtA) and positively charged/aromatic cluster from the activation segment (AS). We show that residues from these regions form an extended membrane-interacting surface that resembles the membrane-interacting residues from known membrane-binding domains. Activating phosphorylatable regions (NtA and AS), make direct contact with the membrane whereas R.RKTR forms specific multivalent salt bridges with PA. PA lipids dwell for longer times around the R.RKTR motif. Our results suggest that membrane interaction of monomeric cRaf kinase domain likely orchestrates the Raf activation process and modulates its function. We show that R.RKTR is a hotspot that interacts with membrane when cRaf is monomeric and becomes part of the interface upon Raf dimerization. We propose that in terms of utilizing a specific hotspot to form membrane interaction and dimer formation, both Raf and its upstream binding partner KRas, are similar. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Fetuin-B deficient mice, on the other hand, are female infertile due to zona pellucida ‘hardening’ caused by the metalloproteinase ovastacin in unfertilized oocytes. In wildtype mice fetuin-B inhibits the activity of ovastacin thus maintaining oocytes fertilizable. Here we asked, if fetuins affect further proteases as might be expected from their evolutionary relation to single-domain-cystatins, known as proteinase-inhibitors. We show that fetuin-A is not an inhibitor of any tested protease. In stark contrast, the closely related fetuin-B selectively inhibits astacin-metalloproteinases such as meprins and ovastacin, but not astacins of the tolloid-subfamily, nor any other proteinase.

The Hippo signaling relies on a core kinase cascade culminating in phosphorylation of the transcription coactivator Yorkie (Yki). Although Yki is the key effector of Hippo pathway, the regulation of its protein stability is still unclear. Here, we show that Hippo pathway attenuates the binding of a ubiquitin-specific protease Usp7 to Yki, which regulates Hippo signaling through deubiquitinating Yki. Furthermore, the mammalian homolog of Usp7, HAUSP plays a conserved role in regulating Hippo pathway by modulating Yap ubiquitination and degradation. Finally, we find that the expression of HAUSP is positively correlated with that of Yap, both showing upregulated levels in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens.

Diet influences the composition of the gut microbiota. The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet established for treatment of therapy-resistant epilepsy in children. Its efficacy in reducing seizures has been confirmed, but the mechanisms remain elusive. The diet has also shown positive effects in a wide range of other diseases, including Alzheimer’s, depression, autism, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. We collected fecal samples from 12 children with therapy-resistant epilepsy before starting KD and after 3 months on the diet. Parents did not start KD and served as diet controls. Applying shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing, both taxonomic and functional profiles were established. Here we report that alpha diversity is not changed significantly during the diet, but differences in both taxonomic and functional composition are detected. Relative abundance of bifidobacteria as well as E. rectale and Dialister is significantly diminished during the intervention. An increase in relative abundance of E. coli is observed on KD. Functional analysis revealed changes in 29 SEED subsystems including the reduction of seven pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Decomposition of these shifts indicates that bifidobacteria and Escherichia are important contributors to the observed functional shifts. As relative abundance of health-promoting, fiber-consuming bacteria becomes less abundant during KD, we raise concern about the effects of the diet on the gut microbiota and overall health. Further studies need to investigate whether these changes are necessary for the therapeutic effect of KD. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Using an integrative approach based on isogenic cell lines generated with CRISPR/Cas9, we uncover an unanticipated role for BAP1 in gene activation. This function requires the assembly of an enzymatically active BAP1-associated core complex (BAP1.com) containing one of the redundant ASXL proteins.

We determined CD4+ T, CD8+ T and CD20+ B cells, monocytes and neutrophils per ml in pleural effusions of 22 LAC and 10 heart failure (HF) patients by flow cytometry. Tumor cells were identified by morphology and CD326 expression. IFNγ, IL-10 and IL-17, and chemokines were determined by ELISAs and migratory response to pleural fluids by transwell assays. MPEs from LAC patients had more CD8+ T lymphocytes and a tendency to more CD4+ T and CD20+ B lymphocytes than HF-related fluids. However, no correlation was found between lymphocytes and tumor cells. In those MPEs which were detected >1 month from LAC diagnosis, there was a negative correlation between pleural tumor cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes. CXCL10 was responsible for the attraction of CD20+ B, CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes in malignant fluids. Concentrations of IL-17 were higher in MPEs than in HF-related effusions. Survival after MPE diagnosis correlated positively with CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes, but negatively with neutrophils and IL-17 levels.

The next step was covalent attachment of anti-HER2 variables domains of camelid heavy chains antibodies (VHHs) or nanobodies (Nbs) to the distal terminals of NHS-PEG3500 in PEI-PEG nanoparticles. The whole procedure yielded PEI-PEG-Nb immunoconjugates. Having determined the properties of polyplexes, steps were taken to investigate the most efficient ratio of PEI polymers to pDNA molecules (N/P) so that the greatest rate of transfection may be obtained. This immune targeted nano biopolymer could condense the gene constructs that coded a transcriptionally targeted truncated -Bid (tBid) killer gene which was controlled by the breast cancer-specific MUC1 promoter. The favourable physicochemical properties matching both the size and zeta potential were observed in engineered polyplexes. Elevated transfection efficiency in HER2 positive cell lines using Nb-modified polyplexes were shown by the results of flow cytometry as compared against non-modified particles. 1.6 and 4.8 fold higher transfection efficiencies were observed in in vitro gene expression researches which used PEI-PEG-Nb/pGL4.50 compared to the situation when native PEI polymers were utilized in both BT-474 and SK-BR-3, respectively. A 2.22 and 3.62 fold rise in the level of tBid gene expression in BT-474 and SK-BR-3 cell lines relative to unmodified PEI treated cells was the result of transfection with PEI-PEG-Nb/pMUC1-tBid, respectively. In those HER2-positive cells which were transfected by targeted polyplexes, higher levels of cell death were observed. This fact points not only to the effective targeted delivery, but it is also indicative of transcriptional targeting efficiency of tBid killer gene when its expression is controlled by MUC1 promoter.","HER2; nanobody; Polyethylenimine (PEI); transcriptional targeting",Article,Scopus

Some previous studies have found that vegetarians might have a lower risk of diabetes than non-vegetarians. Objective: We examined the association between vegetarianism and risk of hospitalisation or death with diabetes in a large, prospective cohort study of British adults. Methods: The analysed cohort included participants from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Oxford study who were diabetes free at recruitment (1993–2001), with available dietary intake data at baseline, and linked hospital admissions and death data for diabetes over follow-up (n = 45,314). Participants were categorised as regular meat eaters (≥50 g per day: n = 15,181); low meat eaters (<50 g of meat per day: n = 7615); fish eaters (ate no meat but consumed fish: n = 7092); and vegetarians (ate no meat or fish, including vegans: n = 15,426). We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to assess associations between diet group and risk of diabetes. Results: Over a mean of 17.6 years of follow-up, 1224 incident cases of diabetes were recorded. Compared with regular meat eaters, the low meat eaters, fish eaters, and vegetarians were less likely to develop diabetes (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54–0.75; HR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.38–0.59; and HR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.54–0.74, respectively). These associations were substantially attenuated after adjusting for body mass index (BMI) (low meat eaters: HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.66–0.92; fish eaters: HR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.51–0.80; and vegetarians: HR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.76–1.05).

Drug combinations have been shown to improve durability and reduce resistance to available first-line therapies in a variety of cancers; however, traditional drug discovery approaches are prohibitively cost and labor-intensive to evaluate large-scale matrices of potential drug combinations. Computational methods are needed to efficiently model complex interactions of drug target pathways and identify mechanisms underlying drug combination synergy. In this study, we employ a computational approach, SynGeNet (Synergy from Gene expression and Network mining), which integrates transcriptomics-based connectivity mapping and network centrality analysis to analyze disease networks and predict drug combinations. As an exemplar of a disease in which combination therapies demonstrate efficacy in genomic-specific contexts, we investigate malignant melanoma. We employed SynGeNet to generate drug combination predictions for each of the four major genomic subtypes of melanoma (BRAF, NRAS, NF1, and triple wild type) using publicly available gene expression and mutation data. We validated synergistic drug combinations predicted by our method across all genomic subtypes using results from a high-throughput drug screening study across. Finally, we prospectively validated the drug combination for BRAF-mutant melanoma that was top ranked by our approach, vemurafenib (BRAF inhibitor) + tretinoin (retinoic acid receptor agonist), using both in vitro and in vivo models of BRAF-mutant melanoma and RNA-sequencing analysis of drug-treated melanoma cells to validate the predicted mechanisms.

Here, we introduce biodegradable laser-synthesized Si nanoparticles having round shape, controllable low-dispersion size, and being free of any toxic impurities, as highly suitable carriers of therapeutic 188 Re radionuclide. The conjugation of the polyethylene glycol-coated Si nanoparticles with radioactive 188 Re takes merely 1 hour, compared to its half-life of 17 hours. When intravenously administered in a Wistar rat model, the conjugates demonstrate free circulation in the blood stream to reach all organs and target tumors, which is radically in contrast with that of the 188 Re salt that mostly accumulates in the thyroid gland. We also show that the nanoparticles ensure excellent retention of 188 Re in tumor, not possible with the salt, which enables one to maximize the therapeutic effect, as well as exhibit a complete time-delayed conjugate bioelimination. Finally, our tests on rat survival demonstrate excellent therapeutic effect (72% survival compared to 0% of the control group).

The goal of this study was to determine the relationship between the expression of lncRNAs and the incidence of hemophilia A in Iranian population. METHODS: In this study, after bioinformatics analysis and lncRNA identification, the expression of two lncRNAs including NONHSAT139215 and NONHSAT139219 was investigated among the blood samples of severe hemophilia A and healthy (non-hemophilia) subjects using the relative qRT-PCR technique. RESULTS: The melting curve analysis confirmed the specificity of primers. Also, the standard curve showed that the efficiency of reactions for β2-microglobulin (B2M), NONHSAT139215 and NONHSAT139219 was 1.91, 1.96 and 2.01, respectively.

DISCUSSION: Our results demonstrated that a decrease in the expression of two lncRNAs located in FVIII gene may play an important role for the development of severe hemophilia A for the first time. CONCLUSIONS: Briefly, the abnormal expression levels of lncRNAs in hemophilia A cases may be correlated with disease intensity.

Its expression is downregulated in almost all the tumor tissues of HCC while the mechanism of this downregulation is not yet fully understood. Recently, we identified 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (PGG) as a GNMT promoter enhancer compound in HCC. In this study, we aimed to delineate the mechanism by which PGG enhances GNMT expression and to investigate its effect on GNMT suppression in HCC. Microarray and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that MYC was a major target of PGG. PGG suppressed MYC mRNA and protein expression in Huh7 and Hep G2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Furthermore, MYC expression was also reduced in xenograft tumors in PGG treated mice. Moreover, shRNA-mediated knocked-down or pharmacological inhibition of MYC resulted in a significant induction of GNMT promoter activity and endogenous GNMT mRNA expression in Huh7 cells. In contrast, overexpression of MYC significantly inhibited GNMT promoter activity and endogenous GNMT protein expression. In addition, antibodies against MYC effectively precipitated the human GNMT promoter in a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Lastly, GNMT expression was negatively correlated with MYC expression in human HCC samples. Interestingly, PGG not only inhibited MYC gene expression but also promoted MYC protein degradation through proteasome-independent pathways. This work reveals a novel anticancer mechanism of PGG via downregulation of MYC expression and establishes a therapeutic rationale for treatment of MYC overexpressing cancers using PGG. Our data also provide a novel mechanistic understanding of GNMT regulation through MYC in the pathogenesis of HCC. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

In this study, the absolute structures of these ustilaginoidins were constructed for the first time by analysis of the biosynthetic monomers obtained from a gene knockout mutant (ΔUV_2091) of V. virens. The gene UV_2091 was predicted to encode an enzyme that dimerized the monomeric naphtho-γ-pyrones in V. virens. Knockout of this gene led to the accumulation of three monomers, namely hemiustilaginoidin F (1), epihemiustilaginoidin D (2), and hemiustilaginoidin D (3), but the production of ustilaginoidins was completely blocked. The structures of the monomers were deduced by spectroscopic analysis, in combination with TDDFT ECD calculations for determining the absolute configurations.

Its capacity to adapt and survive in the human stomach can be attributed to its genetic flexibility. Its natural competence and its capacity to turn genes on and off allows H. pylori to adapt rapidly to the changing conditions of its host. Because of its genetic variability, it is difficult to establish the uniqueness of each strain obtained from a human host. The methods considered to-date to deliver the best result for differentiation of strains are Rapid Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) analysis. While RAPD analysis is cost-effective, it requires a stable genome for its reliability. MLST and WGS are optimal for strain identification, however, they require analysis of data at the bioinformatics level. Using the StainFree method, which modifies tryptophan residues on proteins using 2, 2, 2, - trichloroethanol (TCE), we observed a strain specific pattern of tryptophan in 1D acrylamide gels. In order to establish the effectiveness of tryptophan fingerprinting for strain identification, we compared the graphic analysis of tryptophan-labelled bands in the gel images with MLST results. Based on this, we find that tryptophan banding patterns can be used as an alternative method for the differentiation of H. pylori strains. Furthermore, investigating the origin for these differences, we found that H. pylori strains alters the number and/or position of tryptophan present in several proteins at the genetic code level, with most exchanges taking place in membrane- and cation-binding proteins, which could be part of a novel response of H. pylori to host adaptation. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Here we show that fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) is highly expressed in glioma stem cells and primary glioblastoma (GBM) cells. FGL2 knockout in tumor cells did not affect tumor-cell proliferation in vitro or tumor progression in immunodeficient mice but completely impaired GBM progression in immune-competent mice. This impairment was reversed in mice with a defect in dendritic cells (DCs) or CD103 + DC differentiation in the brain and in tumor-draining lymph nodes. The presence of FGL2 in tumor cells inhibited granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-induced CD103 + DC differentiation by suppressing NF-κB, STAT1/5, and p38 activation. These findings are relevant to GBM patients because a low level of FGL2 expression with concurrent high GM-CSF expression is associated with higher CD8B expression and longer survival. These data provide a rationale for therapeutic inhibition of FGL2 in brain tumors. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

Full-length (motorized) Myo10 protein was deleted, but the brain-specific headless (Hdl) isoform (Hdl-Myo10) was still expressed in homozygous mutants. In vitro, we confirmed that Hdl-Myo10 does not induce filopodia, but it strongly localized to the plasma membrane independent of the MyTH4-FERM domain. Filopodia-inducing Myo10 is implicated in axon guidance and mice lacking the Myo10 cargo protein DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) have severe commissural defects, whereas MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of isolated brains revealed intact commissures in Myo10 tm2/tm2 mice. However, reminiscent of Waardenburg syndrome, a neural crest disorder, Myo10 tm2/tm2 mice exhibited pigmentation defects (white belly spots) and simple syndactyly with high penetrance (&gt;95%), and 24% of mutant embryos developed exencephalus, a neural tube closure defect. Furthermore, Myo10 tm2/tm2 mice consistently displayed bilateral persistence of the hyaloid vasculature, revealed by MRI and retinal whole-mount preparations. In principle, impaired tissue clearance could contribute to persistence of hyaloid vasculature and syndactyly. However, Myo10-deficient macrophages exhibited no defects in the phagocytosis of apoptotic or IgG-opsonized cells. RNA sequence analysis showed that Myo10 was the most strongly expressed unconventional myosin in retinal vascular endothelial cells and expression levels increased 4-fold between P6 and P15, when vertical sprouting angiogenesis gives rise to deeper layers. Nevertheless, imaging of isolated adult mutant retinas did not reveal vascularization defects. In summary, Myo10 is important for both prenatal (neural tube closure and digit formation) and postnatal development (hyaloid regression, but not retinal vascularization). © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

The PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis has been implicated in fibrosis, with pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibition currently under clinical evaluation in IPF. Here we demonstrate that rapamycin-insensitive mTORC1 signaling via 4E-BP1 is a critical pathway for TGF-β 1 stimulated collagen synthesis in human lung fibroblasts, whereas canonical PI3K/Akt signaling is not required. The importance of mTORC1 signaling was confirmed by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in normal and IPF fibroblasts, as well as in lung cancer-associated fibroblasts, dermal fibroblasts and hepatic stellate cells. The inhibitory effect of ATP-competitive mTOR inhibition extended to other matrisome proteins implicated in the development of fibrosis and human disease relevance was demonstrated in live precision-cut IPF lung slices.

Thirty-six cafés were selected and the concentration of three pollutants including formaldehyde, carbon monoxide and nicotine were measured in both indoor and outdoor air of cafés two times (week-day and weekend’s session). Air sampling was performed for 180 min for each pollutant. It was observed that the concentration of pollutants inside the cafés was higher during weekend session (with a higher number of “active waterpipe heads”) compared with findings during the week-day sessions. Furthermore, the concentration of pollutants in the indoor air of the cafés was significantly higher than that of the outdoors (p &lt; 0.05). According to path analysis, the number of “active waterpipe heads” had the maximum impact on generation of pollutants inside the cafés, followed by the type of tobacco as the second influential factor. The average of lifetime cancer risk (LTCR) resulted by formaldehyde exposure through inhalation in waterpipe (WS), cigarette (CS), waterpipe and cigarette (WCS) and none-smoking (NS) cafés in week-day and weekend sessions were estimated to be 111 × 10 −5 and 61.2 × 10 −5 , 33.7 × 10 −5 and 39.4 × 10 −5 , 271 × 10 −5 and 322 × 10 −5 , and 4.80 × 10 −5 and 5.90 × 10 −5 , respectively, which exceed the limit value by the U.S.EPA and WHO. The concentration of pollutants in the indoor air of smoking cafés in Tehran is significantly high, such that it can pose serious risks for the health of both personnel and customers.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the potential synergistic sleep enhancement effect of GABA/l-theanine mixture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pentobarbital-induced sleep test was applied to find proper concentration for sleep-promoting effect in ICR mice. Electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis was performed to investigate total sleeping time and sleep quality in normal SD rats and caffeine-induced awareness model. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was applied to investigate whether the sleep-promoting mechanism of GABA/l-theanine mixture involved transcriptional processes. RESULTS: GABA/l-theanine mixture (100/20 mg/kg) showed a decrease in sleep latency (20.7 and 14.9%) and an increase in sleep duration (87.3 and 26.8%) compared to GABA or theanine alone. GABA/l-theanine mixture led to a significant increase in rapid eye movement (REM) (99.6%) and non-REM (NREM) (20.6%) compared to controls. The use of GABA/l-theanine mixture rather than GABA or l-theanine alone restored to normal levels sleep time and quality in the arousal animal model. The administration of GABA/l-theanine led to increased expression of GABA and the glutamate GluN1 receptor subunit. CONCLUSIONS: GABA/l-theanine mixture has a positive synergistic effect on sleep quality and duration as compared to the GABA or l-theanine alone. The increase in GABA receptor and GluN1 expression is attributed to the potential neuromodulatory properties of GABA/l-theanine combination, which seems to affect sleep behaviour.","electroencephalography; insomnia; pentobarbital-induced sleep test; γ-Aminobutyric acid",Article,Scopus

A handful of loci have been associated with GSD in populations of predominantly European ancestry, however, they only explain a small portion of the genetic component of the disease. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for GSD in 1,095 admixed Chilean Latinos with Mapuche Native American ancestry. Disease status was assessed by cholecystectomy or abdominal ultrasonography. Top-10 candidate variants surpassing the suggestive cutoff of P &lt; 1 × 10 −5 in the discovery cohort were genotyped in an independent replication sample composed of 1,643 individuals. Variants with positive replication were further examined in two European GSD populations and a Chilean GBC cohort. We consistently replicated the association of ABCG8 gene with GSD (rs11887534, P = 3.24 × 10 −8 , OR = 1.74) and identified TRAF3 (rs12882491, P = 1.11 × 10 −7 , OR = 1.40) as a novel candidate gene for the disease in admixed Chilean Latinos. ABCG8 and TRAF3 variants also conferred risk to GBC. Gene expression analyses indicated that TRAF3 was significantly decreased in gallbladder (P = 0.015) and duodenal mucosa (P = 0.001) of GSD individuals compared to healthy controls, where according to GTEx data in the small intestine, the presence of the risk allele contributes to the observed effect. We conclude that ABCG8 and TRAF3 genes are associated with GSD and GBC in admixed Latinos and that decreased TRAF3 levels could enhance gallbladder inflammation as is observed in GSD and GSD-associated GBC. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Article,Scopus

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients with early penile carcinoma were treated by high-dose rate brachyther-apy at dose 18 × 3 Gy per fraction twice daily between 2002-&#8202;2018 at the Department of Oncology and Radiother-apy, University Hospital in Hradec Kralove. Breast interstitial brachyther-apy template was used for fixation and precise geometry reconstruction of stainless hollow needles. RESULTS: Median follow up was 85 months (range 7-&#8202;200 months). Acute reaction usually consisted of grade 2 mucositis that dissolved dur-ing 8 weeks after the treatment. Local recurrence occurred in 6 patients, 5 of them were successfully treated with partial amputation. One patient had a nodal recurrence successfully salvaged by lymphadenectomy. One patient developed necrosis of the glans requir-ing partial amputation. Currently, there are 24 patients alive without signs of dis-ease. One patient died of cardiac comorbidity, one died of duplicate lung cancer. Nineteen patients have a preserved penis (73%), 18 of them sexually active before treatment report satisfactory intercourse. CONCLUSION: Hyperfractionated interstitial high-dose rate brachyther-apy with 18 × 3 Gy per fraction twice daily is a promis-ing method in selected patients with penile carcinoma and deserves further evaluation in a larger prospective study.

In the present study, the volatile oil of the plant was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-MS. In addition, antibacterial and anti-Helicobacter pylori activities of this essential oil were determined using disc diffusion and agar dilution methods, respectively. Insecticidal activity was assessed through topical and fumigation application of the essential oil to cabbage looper larvae. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition by the essential oil was examined using Ellman’s method. Furthermore, its cytotoxic potential against three different cancer cell lines was assessed using the MTT assay. The phenolic monoterpenoids, thymol (38.79%), and carvacrol (36.30%) were identified as major constituents of the essential oil. We observed significant antibacterial activity of the essential oil against H. pylori (MIC=20.4 µg /mL) as well as other tested bacteria, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. O. decumbens essential oil showed significant toxicity to cabbage looper larvae with LD 50 value of 52.1 µg /larva following topical and fumigant administration. O. decumbens essential oil was considerably inhibitory to acetylcholinesterase activity (IC50 = 0.117 µg/mL). Cytotoxic assay of the volatile oil resulted in IC50 = 0.065, 0.104, and 0.141 μg/mL for MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, respectively. According to our data, this species with high concentrations of thymol and carvacrol could be considered as a natural source for pharmaceutical products. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

Punica granatum L. has a potential anticancer effect. This study determined the antiproliferative and antiangiogenic potential of the extract from pomegranate pericarp (PPE) in melanoma. Melanoma cells (1 × 10 6 ) were injected to C57BL6 mice subcutaneously. On 8 th day, mice were randomly divided into 9 groups. Group 1 was considered as control and received distilled water. Groups 2 to 5 received 50, 100, 200 or 400 mg/kg of standardized PPE, orally. Group 6 received 400 mg/kg PPE and PPAR-γ antagonist (T0070907, 5 mg/kg/day). Group 7 received 400 mg/kg PPE and PPAR-α antagonist (GW6471, 10 mg/kg/day). Groups 8 and 9 received PPAR antagonists alone. On the 16 th day, mice were euthanized and the tumor samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry staining for Ki-67 and CD31. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plasma level was determined by ELISA. PPE at the doses of 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg decreased tumor weight to 1.28, 1.03, 0.82, and 0.58 g, respectively, in comparison with 1.46 g in control group. Tumor volume reduced to 2.1, 1.7, 1.35 and 0.95 cm 3 at the mentioned doses, in comparison with 2.4 cm 3 in control group (P &lt; 0.05 for all groups). VEGF, Ki-67 and CD31 were decreased dose dependently in the treatment groups (P &lt; 0.05). PPARα and PPARγ antagonists significantly reduced the extract effects (P &lt; 0.05). It was concluded that PPE may have a potential implication in melanoma treatment through activation of PPARα and PPARγ receptors. © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

A fluoromethyl azetidine group was found to be preferred and resulted in the identification of bis-phenol chromene 17ha. In a tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer xenograft model, 17ha (ER-α degradation efficacy = 97%) demonstrated tumor regression, together with robust reduction of intratumoral ER-α levels. However, despite superior oral exposure, 5a (ER-α degradation efficacy = 91%) had inferior activity. This result suggests that optimizing ER-α degradation efficacy leads to compounds with robust effects in a model of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.

The ability of metastatic cancer cells to stay dormant for extended time periods and reawaken at later stages leading to disease recurrence makes treatment of metastatic disease extremely challenging. The tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in deciding the ultimate fate of tumor cells, yet the mechanisms by which this occurs, including dormancy, is not well understood. This mini-review discusses bioengineered models inspired from tissue engineering strategies that mimic key aspects of the tumor microenvironment to study tumor dormancy. These models include biomaterial based three dimensional models, microfluidic based models, as well as bioreactor based models that incorporate relevant microenvironmental components such as extracellular matrix molecules, niche cells, or their combination to study microenvironmental regulation of tumor dormancy.

The antegrade lymphatic flow in patients with normal anatomy and physiology makes metastasis of lower gingival cancer to BN unlikely. Case presentation: A 67-year-old woman presented with a 46 × 25-mm tumor on her lower gingiva, along with metastatic foci in BN and cervical lymph nodes. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, she underwent radical resection of the primary tumor and BN, along with neck dissection. Following surgery, she received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Two years after treatment, there has been no evidence of tumor recurrence or metastasis. Conclusion: This is the first report of lower gingival squamous cell carcinoma with metastasis to BN. Metastasis to BN from lower gingival cancer is very rare but should be considered in patients with locally advanced tumors or tumors that metastasize to the submandibular node. © 2019 The Author(s).","Buccinator lymph nodes; Facial lymph nodes; Metastasis; Oral cancer; Squamous cell carcinoma",Review,Scopus

Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic pro-survival protein, whose expression is associated with a favorable outcome in human breast cancer. The aim of our study was to determine the frequency of Bcl-2 expression in feline invasive mammary carcinomas (FMCs), its relationship with other clinicopathologic variables, and its prognostic value. This retrospective study included 180 FMCs, diagnosed in female cats treated by surgery only, with a 2-year follow-up post-mastectomy. Bcl-2, ER, PR, Ki-67, HER2, and CK5/6 expression were determined by automated immunohistochemistry. A receiver-operating-characteristic curve was used to set the threshold for Bcl-2 positivity. Results: The cohort comprises 32% (57/180) luminal FMCs defined by ER and/or PR positivity, and 68% (123/180) triple-negative FMCs (negative for ER, PR, and HER2). Bcl-2 expression was considered as positive when at least 65% of tumor cells were immunohistochemically stained. Thirty-one out of 180 FMCs (17%) were Bcl-2-positive. There was no significant association between Bcl-2 expression, and the tumor size, nodal stage, histological grade, or ER, PR, Ki-67, HER2, and CK5/6 expression. By multivariate survival analysis (Cox proportional-hazards regression), Bcl-2 positivity in FMCs was associated with longer disease-free interval (p = 0.005, HR = 0.38), overall survival (p = 0.028, HR = 0.61), and cancer-specific survival (p = 0.019, HR = 0.54) independently of other powerful prognostic factors such as pathologic tumor size, pathologic nodal stage, and distant metastasis. The positive prognostic value of Bcl-2 was confirmed in both luminal FMCs, of which 9/57 (16%) were Bcl-2-positive, and in basal-like triple-negative (ER-, PR-, HER2-, CK5/6+) FMCs, of which 14/76 (18%) were Bcl-2-positive. Conclusions: Compared to human breast cancer, Bcl-2 positivity in feline invasive mammary carcinomas is also associated with better outcome, but is less common, and not associated with ER, PR, and HER2 expression. Cats with spontaneous Bcl-2-positive FMCs could be useful in preclinical trials evaluating anti-Bcl-2 strategies for chemoresistant luminal or triple-negative breast cancers. © 2019 The Author(s).","Bcl-2; Breast cancer; Feline mammary carcinoma; Spontaneous animal model",Article,Scopus

It occurs because of the alkylation of various bases. These modifications of genes carried through altered creations of proteins ultimately lead to various diseases. For example, a vital cause behind canine lymphoma is found to be DNA methylation in the guanine base. In this work, we analyzed the methylated and nonmethylated guanine structure with the assistance of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT). Because of their vulnerability for causing DNA methylation, the N7 and O6 positions of the guanine structure were the positions of interest with the addition of various adducts such as methyl, hydroxyethyl, and deuterated methyl groups. To distinguish the methylated samples from the nonmethylated ones, principal component analysis was performed, and the same analysis was used to distinguish their methylated positions and added adducts. The experimental results were then explained by structure optimization and frequency calculation of the molecules based on DFT calculations. To understand the charge distribution and detect the possible locations of alkylation of DNA bases, electrostatic potential, highest occupied molecular orbital, and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital for each of the molecules were analyzed, and the reactivity was discussed in the light of electronic structure calculations.

The aim of the study was to appraise the number of circulating endothelial precursors and the concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and the soluble forms of its receptors, sVEGFR1 and sVEGFR2, in breast cancer patients with respect to clinicopathological features. Material and methods: The study involved 85 women of Caucasian ethnicity aged 45–66 with primary breast cancer without distant metastases (M0). Inclusion criteria were as follows: histopathological examination confirming the diagnosis of primary breast cancer, without previous radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Immunohistochemistry evaluation of oestrogen and progesterone receptors, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, Ki67 expression was made in all cases. In the EDTA-plasma, the concentrations of VEGF-A and its soluble receptors, sVEGFR1 and sVEGFR2, were measured applying immunoassay techniques.

Their perceived uncertainty in illness and their personal experiences with the services received are crucial factors for a qualitatively adequate assistance. Objectives: To assess the determinants of patient satisfaction, using a sample of 306 Bulgarian oncology outpatients. Methods: The hypotheses tested concern the extent to which patient satisfaction depends on the uncertainty in illness; the patients’ assessment of technical and interpersonal skills of nurses and medical staff; the information provision; and some organizational aspects. Patients were asked to answer a questionnaire composed of internationally validated scales assessing the determinants of patient satisfaction (measured through the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer), uncertainty in illness (assessed through the Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale), and patients’ health status (assessed through the EuroQol 5-dimensional questionnaire and the visual analogue scale). An ordered logit model was run, using the level of overall patient satisfaction as a dependent variable. Results: This is one of the first studies carried out in Bulgaria for oncology patient satisfaction of subjective factors related to the frailty of the oncology patient status such as age, self-assessed health-related quality of life, and uncertainty in illness. Nevertheless, other determinants, reflecting the quality of the care provided, also have an impact on patient satisfaction, namely, the assessment of the nonmedical personnel, the perception of medical technical skills, and the access to a medical center. Conclusions: Results stress the relevance of reducing uncertainty in illness in patients with cancer by implementing a satisfactory patient-physician relationship in the management of the disease. © 2018 ISPOR–The professional society for health economics and outcomes research","Bulgaria; health technology assessment; HTA; oncology diseases; patient satisfaction",Article,Scopus

Results: It has been proved that certain inﬂammatory mediators might be involved in tumor progression, such as growth, proliferation, migration and angiogenesis of tumor cells. In the present review, we summarized and referred to a number of original papers concerning the clinical significance of selected cytokines and specific inflammatory proteins such as C-reactive protein, as well as of various matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors, as potential biomarkers for PC in comparison to well-established tumor markers for this malignancy. Conclusion: Presented proteins might be potential biomarkers in the diagnosis and progression of PC. © 2019","Biomarker; Pancreas; Tumor",Review,Scopus

With the specificity to target receptors which are uniquely or overexpressed on cancer cells as well as accurately targeting dysregulated signaling pathways, peptides demonstrate a high potential for the treatment of even the most aggressive cancers. By binding to these targets, peptides can be used to deliver drugs, serve as antagonists to various ligands, or, given some inherent anticancer activity, provide additional treatment options alone or in combination therapy. The highly specific targeting capacity of peptides is critical to achieve effective cancer treatment with limited side effects, and in preclinical studies peptides have shown to have both cell and blood brain barrier penetrating capacity.

This Cochrane review, published originally in 2012, was updated in 2017. Methods: We updated our search of Cochrane CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL to December 2017. Only RCTs investigating local anesthetics (by any route) or regional anesthesia versus any combination of systemic (opioid or non-opioid) analgesia in adults or children, reporting any pain outcomes beyond three months were included. Data were extracted independently by at least two authors, who also appraised methodological quality with Cochrane ‘Risk of bias’ assessment and pooled data in surgical subgroups. We pooled studies across different follow-up intervals. As summary statistic, we reported the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals and calculated the number needed to benefit (NNTB). We considered classical, Bayesian alternatives to our evidence synthesis. We explored heterogeneity and methodological bias. Results: 40 new and seven ongoing studies, identified in this update, brought the total included RCTs to 63. We were only able to synthesize data from 39 studies enrolling 3027 participants in a balanced design. Evidence synthesis favored regional anesthesia for thoracotomy (OR 0.52 [0.32 to 0.84], moderate-quality evidence), breast cancer surgery (OR 0.43 [0.28 to 0.68], low-quality evidence), and cesarean section (OR 0.46, [0.28 to 0.78], moderate-quality evidence). Evidence synthesis favored continuous infusion of local anesthetic after breast cancer surgery (OR 0.24 [0.08 to 0.69], moderate-quality evidence), but was inconclusive after iliac crest bone graft harvesting (OR 0.20, [0.04 to 1.09], low-quality evidence). Conclusions: Regional anesthesia reduces the risk of PPP. Small study size, performance, null, and attrition bias considerably weakened our conclusions.

To date, expression hosts for purification of AID/APOBEC3 enzymes include bacteria, insect and mammalian cells. Here the establishment and optimization of a yeast expression/secretion system for AID/APOBEC3s are reported, followed by comparison with the same enzymes expressed in bacterial and mammalian hosts.

Chest organs are screened on the film or digital file which go to the doctor for evaluation. However, the analysis of x-ray images requires much experience and time. Clinical decision support is very important for medical examinations. The use of Computational Intelligence can simulate the evaluation and decision processes of a medical expert. We propose a method to provide a decision support for the doctor in order to help to consult each case faster and more precisely. Methods: We use image descriptors based on the spatial distribution of Hue, Saturation and Brightness values in x-ray images, and a neural network co-working with heuristic algorithms (Moth-Flame, Ant Lion) to detect degenerated lung tissues in x-ray image. The neural network evaluates the image and if the possibility of a respiratory disease is detected, the heuristic method identifies the degenerated tissues in the x-ray image in detail based on the use of the proposed fitness function. Results: The average accuracy is 79.06% in pre-detection stage, similarly the sensitivity and the specificity averaged for three pre-classified diseases are 84.22% and 66.7%, respectively.

Conclusions: The proposed neuro-heuristic approach addresses small changes in the structure of lung tissues, which appear in pneumonia, sarcoidosis or cancer and some consequences that may appear after the treatment. The results show high potential of the newly proposed method. Additionally, the method is flexible and has low computational burden. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Clinical decision support; Heuristic methods; Medical image processing; Neural networks",Article,Scopus

In this work, the aim is to summarize the processes that pertain to the (photo) Fenton reaction. More specifically, this review does not consider previous work relating to the Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP)-mediated disinfection/decontamination of stream flows, as much work has successfully achieved this. Instead, this manuscript presents an overview of the other fields of environmental and medical applications of (photo)Fenton: i) surface pre-treatment (nano-particles functionalization or modification), ii) terrestrial and algal biomass (pre)treatment to enhance high value products’ recovery, iii) cancer treatment (malignant tumor elimination) and iv) other medical uses (antibiotics development, wounds disinfection, root canal sterilization and teeth whitening). For each field of application, the focus lies on analyzing the conceptualization and framework of the (photo) Fenton process, the opportunities and limitations, as well as a series of related applications.

Therefore, comprehensive research and the appropriate tools are needed in this field. Animal models and cell culture studies are the most important preclinical tools in cancer research. In 2D cell culture models, cells are forced to grow in a 2D environment, which differs from their natural physiology. Recently, 3D cell culture models were developed to fill the gap between 2D cell culture and animal models. Materials and methods: Human amniotic membranes were obtained, decellularized, characterized and used as a natural 3D scaffold to investigate cancer cell behavior in 2D compared to 3D conditions. Time-lapse imaging of cells was used, and cell proliferation, velocity and migration were evaluated. Cisplatin was applied in 2D and 3D conditions, followed by evaluation of viability, apoptosis and cancer stem cell proteins by flow cytometry and western blot analysis. Results: The results showed that in the decellularized amnion membrane (DAM) scaffold most cells did not spread and remain rounded and then penetrated into the scaffold with no cytotoxicity. Significant differences in migration, velocity, morphology and proliferation of cancer cells were observed between the 3D DAM scaffold and 2D model. Furthermore, the cells in the 3D DAM scaffold showed much more resistance to apoptosis and higher CSC content. Conclusion: In conclusion, considering the effect of the 3D DAM scaffold in cell behavior, apoptosis resistance and CSC content as well as the short processing time for decellularizing the AM, it appears that the 3D DAM scaffold offers an appropriate tool for in vitro cancer research. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","3D scaffold; Amnion membrane; Apoptosis; Cancer; Cancer stem cell",Article,Scopus

In addition, the enhanced anti-cancer effects of PTX formulations were compared in various breast cancer cell lines. The SD formulations with various copolymers were prepared using a solvent evaporation method, and micelles with Soluplus® mixed with D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000-succinate (TPGS) were prepared using a film hydration method. The physical properties of SD and M formulations were evaluated. The dissolution (%) of SD4 and SD9 formulations, and the solubility of M2 were significantly higher than those of PTX. The SD formulations and micelles were also stable for 3 and 1 month, respectively. The anti-cancer effects of SD4, SD9, and M2 significantly increased in breast cancer cells, whereas the blank formulations were not toxic to normal cells. The SD4, SD9 and M formulations improved the permeability of Cou-6 compared to Cou-6 solution in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK line). The SD formulations and micelles had enhanced bioavailability (BA) compared to that of PTX, showing relative BA values of 667.3% (SD4), 359.6% (SD9), and 365.4% (M2). This study demonstrates the technologies to increase the anti-cancer effects and BA of PTX, via SD and micelle formulations, and, to our knowledge, is the first comparison of the two formulations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Anti-cancer effects; Micelles; Oral absorption; Paclitaxel (PTX); Solid dispersion (SD); Solubility",Article,Scopus

Biologic agents have shown promise as adjuncts to chemotherapy in metastatic colon cancer, but the effect on earlier stage cancer remains unclear. Materials and methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the additive effect of biologic agents to adjuvant chemotherapy on survival in colorectal cancer (all comers and subpopulations defined by microsatellite instability, BRAF and KRAS status, and stage). Only randomized controlled trials published between 2002 and 2017 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were included. The control arm: chemotherapy alone, the intervention arm: chemotherapy with biologic agents. Outcomes: overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival. Results: Six trials including 10,754 patients were included. OS (hazard ratio [HR] 2.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.15-3.03) and disease-free survival (HR 2.54, 95% CI 2.25-2.87) were significantly worse in the intervention arm. High heterogeneity was explained by subgroup analysis of different biologic agents (bevacizumab versus others); however, results still showed harm in the intervention arm across subgroups. Bevacizumab was associated with improved OS in patients with microsatellite instability (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36-0.92); this was the only indication of benefit for a biomarker-defined subpopulation. Analyses by tumor stage failed to demonstrate advantage with use of a biologic agent; however, it explained heterogeneity. Conclusions: The addition of biologic agents to adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of high-risk stage II and III colorectal cancer is associated with worse survival outcomes. The only subgroup of patients that may benefit from the addition of bevacizumab to adjuvant chemotherapy is those with microsatellite unstable tumors. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Adjuvant chemotherapy; Biologics; Colorectal cancer",Review,Scopus

Specificity of these sensors were ensured by a layer of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) which was electropolymerized in situ with the analytes as template. All the sensors were tested with standard buffers and mouse blood samples, showing satisfactory performance towards the corresponding analytes. Dynamic concentration for the six analytes was in the range of 10 −11 –10 −8 mol/L with the detection limit down to 20 pmol/L. In addition, artificially synthesized MIP film on the electrodes allowed for good selectivity and stability.

Although screening has decreased colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality, it remains a common and often fatal malignancy. In this study, we sought to identify an optical imaging agent for the application of FGS technology to CRC. Methods: We compared a panitumumab-IRDye800CW conjugate to an IgG-IRDye800CW isotype control. Mice were implanted with one of three CRC cell lines (LS174T, Colo205, and SW948) and imaged with open- and closed-filed fluorescence imaging systems. Fluorescent contrast was quantified by calculating the ratio between tumor and background fluorescence. After 10 d, the mice were sacrificed, and their tumors stained for microscopic imaging. Results: Panitumumab-IRDye800CW produced significantly greater (P < 0.05) fluorescent contrast in all three cell lines. Average tumor to background ratio was 6.00 versus 2.60 for LS174T, 5.78 versus 2.52 for Colo205, and 4.31 versus 1.70 for SW948. A 1-mg tumor fragment produced significantly greater fluorescent contrast in the Colo205 and SW948 cell lines in the panitumumab-IRDye800CW group. Western blotting for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and a semiquantitative analysis of EGFR expression noted strong expression in all three cell lines; however, EGFR expression did not directly correlate to tumor to background ratio. Conclusions: Panitumumab-IRDye800CW produces significantly greater fluorescent contrast than IgG-IRDye800CW in a murine model of CRC and is a suitable agent for the application of FGS technology to CRC. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Cancer surgery; Colorectal cancer; Epidermal growth factor receptor; Fluorescence-guided surgery; Gastrointestinal surgery; IRDye800CW; Oncology; Panitumumab",Article,Scopus

However, different preclinical and clinical studies have noted significant shortcomings, such as nonspecific tumor targeting and low bioavailability which limit their usage in therapeutics. Therefore, a safe and compatible nanoparticle mediated controlled drug delivery system is in high demand to enable effective transport of the drug candidates in the tumor tissue. Herein, we have synthesized phenylboronic acid (PBA) conjugated Zinc oxide nanoparticles (PBA-ZnO), loaded with quercetin (a bioflavonoid widely found in plants), with zeta potential around −10.2 mV and diameter below 40 nm. Presence of PBA moieties over the nanoparticle surface facilitates targeted delivery of quercetin to the sialic acid over-expressed cancer cells. Moreover, Quercetin loaded PBA-ZnO nanoparticles (denoted as PBA-ZnO-Q) showed pH responsive drug release behavior. Results suggested that PBA-ZnO-Q induced apoptotic cell death in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) via enhanced oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. In line with the in vitro results, PBA-ZnO-Q was found to be effective in reducing tumor growth in EAC tumor bearing mice. Most interestingly, PBA-ZnO-Q is found to reduce tumor associated toxicity in liver, kidney and spleen. The cytotoxic potential of the nanohybrid is attributed to the combinatorial cytotoxic effects of quercetin and ZnO in the cancer cells. Overall, the presented data highlighted the chemotherapeutic potential of the novel nanohybrid, PBA-ZnO-Q which can be considered for clinical cancer treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Anticancer; PBA conjugated nanoparticles; Quercetin; Reactive oxygen species; ZnO nanoparticles",Article,Scopus

Poorly differentiated GC predicts a poor prognosis and is related to patients’ response to chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Therefore, it is very important to accurately evaluate the tumour differentiation status for the treatment of poorly differentiated GC. To develop a molecular probe to analyse poorly differentiated GC, we selected aptamers against poorly differentiated GC by subtractive Cell-SELEX using the poorly differentiated GC cell line BGC-823 as the target and the moderately differentiated GC cell line SGC-7901 as the negative control. After 15 rounds of selection, aptamer PDGC21 exhibited the highest affinity, and the K d value of the truncated aptamer PDGC21-T was 35.2 ± 1.1 nM. Aptamer PDGC21-T not only specifically bound to the target cells but also bound to other poorly differentiated GC cells. When combined with fluorescent nanoparticle quantum dots (QDs), the PDGC21-T-QD probe could distinguish poorly differentiated GC cells in mixed culture cells and clinical specimens. Furthermore, in a tissue microarray containing 15 cases from patients, there was a higher positive rate in GC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues; in poorly differentiated tissues, in particular, the fluorescence signal was significantly higher than that in well/moderately differentiated tissues. Therefore, aptamer PDGC21-T holds great potential for use as a molecular imaging probe for the detection of poorly differentiated GC, which is of great significance for diagnosis and treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aptamer; Cell-SELEX; Gastric cancer; Poorly differentiated; Quantum dots; Targeted imaging",Article,Scopus

Methods: A total of 156 patients with R0 resected colorectal cancer were selected from 2011 to 2015 to carry out a retrospective study. The survival rate according to the groups of positive lymph node number (N: 1-3, N2: 4-6, N3: ≥7) and TSLN (TSLN [-], TSLN [+]) was analyzed. The influences of covariates on the 5-year overall survival (OS) and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) were determined by the Cox proportional risk model of backward stepwise analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to draw survival curves between and within groups. Results: During the median follow-up period (44.0 months), the 5-year DFS rate and OS rate were 45.0% and 46.0%, respectively. Survival analysis of the TSLN group showed that the 5-year OS rate and 5-year DFS rate in the TSLN (+) group (20.0 and 16.2%, respectively) were significantly lower than those in the TSLN (-) group (68.3 and 51.6%, respectively) (P < 0.001). The 5-year OS rate and DFS rate of the TSLN (+) and TSLN (-) subgroups in the N1 group were 16.7%, 33.3%, 56.7%, and 55.7%, respectively (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that positive lymph node, TSLN, and Pathological T stage were independent prognostic factors of DFS and OS for 5 years.

Herein, we demonstrate the conformational switch-based fluorescence detection of telomerase activity using a redesigned RNA aptamer Spinach. Briefly, the original Spinach aptamer was extended at its 5′ end and folded into an inactive conformation, where association with the small molecule fluorophore, 5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone (DFHBI) was prevented. Only in the presence of telomerase, (TTAGGG) n repeats were added to the 3′ end of the telomerase substrate primer, and the elongation products hybridized with inactive Spinach molecules, triggering its conformational switch and refolding it into the active, DFHBI-binding conformation. Moreover, the fluorescence signal was further amplified through a target recycling circuit, where Ribonuclease H (RNase H) specifically hydrolyzed the phosphodiester bonds of RNA in the DNA-RNA hybrid. The released telomere products could then hybridize to new inactive Spinach molecules and initiate multiple amplification cycles. The proposed fluorescent biosensor presented great performance for telomerase activity detection from 100 to 5 × 10 4 Hela cells with a detection limit of 100 cells. Besides, this new assay offers a good biosensing platform for differentiation of cancer cell lines from normal cell line and evaluation the inhibition efficiency of telomere-binding ligand, which is of great importance for telomerase-related cancer diagnosis and therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Fluorescent biosensors; Inhibitor; Ribonuclease H; Spinach; Telomerase activity",Article,Scopus

However, there is still challenge in the clinical detection of HER2. In this work, a simple strategy for “turn on” fluorescent detection of HER2 with ultra-sensitivity and high specificity was developed. Herein, HER2-binding aptamer (HApt) and DNA2 containing G-rich sequences, templated sequences for Ag nanoclusters (AgNCs), and complementary bases at both ends were involved to achieve the double stranded DNA templated AgNCs (dsDNA-AgNCs) as a fluorescence probe for HER2 detection. In the presence of HER2, the highly specific binding of HER2 to HApt caused HApt separating from dsDNA-AgNCs, resulting in the folding of DNA2-AgNCs because of the complementary bases at both ends, which led to AgNCs’ proximity to G-rich sequences, and therefore the enhanced fluorescence intensity. By monitoring the change in fluorescence signal (ΔF), HER2 was measured, and a linear range from 8.5 fM to 225 fM with a limit of detection (LOD) 0.0904 fM was obtained. More significantly, the detection of HER2 in serum samples was achieved with high accuracy, and the breast cancer patients were successfully discriminated from healthy persons. In summary, this strategy is simple, time-saving, cost-effective, ultrasensitive, specific, universal and more applicable for the detection of HER2. Therefore, we expect this present aptasensor can be used in the clinical detection of biomakers, which lays a potential foundation for the early diagnosis of cancer. © 2019","Aptasensor; HER2; Silver nanoclusters",Article,Scopus

We developed and evaluated an immunoglobulin Y (IgY)-based ELISA to measure total PSA (tPSA) concentrations in human serum that could be used as an alternative to commercially available in vitro diagnostic assays that rely on mouse monoclonal IgG. METHODS: A sandwich ELISA based on an anti-PSA IgY antibody was developed. We evaluated the ability of the anti-PSA IgY antibody to detect free and complexed PSA at the same molar ratio. The assay was optimized, and its analytical performance was verified by calculating limit of background (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantification (LoQ). We performed correlation and regression analyses between tPSA concentrations measured by our ELISA and those from commercial assays: Cobas 6000 (Roche Diagnostics, Warszawa, Poland) and PSA total ELISA (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany). RESULTS: LoB, LoD, and LoQ, were 0.061, 0.083, and 0.100 ng/mL, respectively, and linearity range was 0.100-3.375 ng/mL. tPSA concentrations from our IgY-based ELISA strongly correlated with those from the commercial assays. CONCLUSIONS: Our IgY-based ELISA is an efficient equivalent to the above commercial assays. The use of IgY as the detecting agent could reduce the risk of false positive results, as well as decrease the overall cost of analysis. © The Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine.","Immunoglobulin Y; In vitro diagnostics; Performance; Prostate cancer; Prostate specific antigen; Sandwich ELISA",Article,Scopus

To understand the metastatic principle at molecular levels, it is necessary to carry out experiments in which cancer cells and their normal counterparts are compared. However, unlike normal human melanocytes, preparation of normal mouse melanocytes is quite difficult due to the lack of marketing and insufficient information on an established protocol for primary culture of mouse melanocytes. In this study, we aimed to establish a convenient method for primary culture of mouse melanocytes on the basis of the protocol for human melanocytes. The main obstacles to preparing pure mouse melanocytes are how to digest mouse skin tissue and how to reduce the contamination of keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The obstacles were overcome by collagenase digestion for skin specimens, short time trypsinization for separating melanocytes and keratinocytes, and use of 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and cholera toxin in the culture medium. These supplements act to prevent the proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, respectively. The convenient procedure enabled us to prepare a pure culture of normal mouse melanocytes. Using enriched normal mouse melanocytes and cancerous B16-BL6 cells, we compared the expression levels of melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM), an important membrane protein for melanoma metastasis, in the cells. The results showed markedly higher expression of MCAM in B16-BL6 cells than in normal mouse melanocytes. © 2019 The Authors","Melanocytes; Melanoma; Metastasis; Primary culture",Article,Scopus

Enzyme kinetic parameters were determined by voltammetry and the electrochemical assay compared with fluorescence spectroscopy. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and atomic force microscopy were also used to investigate substrate interaction with the 20S proteasome and their adsorption at the electrode surface.

We aim to identify the prognostic relevance of primary tumor location in patients undergoing treatment for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Materials and methods: The National Cancer Database was used to identify patients with PDAC from 1998 to 2011 (n = 175,556). Patients were categorized by primary tumor site into head (67.5%, n = 118,343), body (15.5%, n = 27,218), and tail (17.0%, n = 29,885) groups. Univariate and Cox regression analyses were used to determine covariates associated with overall survival (OS). Results: Patients with head PDAC presented with earlier stage disease (39.2% Stage I/II versus 19.7% versus 16.0%, P < 0.001) and underwent resection more often (27.9% versus 10.7% versus 17.0%, P < 0.001) than those with body or tail tumors. Of surgically resected PDAC, those localized to the head had advanced pathologic stage (84.8% stage II/III versus 66.6% versus 65.6%, P < 0.001), higher nodal positivity (64.9% versus 45.8% versus 45%, P < 0.001), and worse tumor grade (35.9% poorly differentiated versus 29.5% versus 27.8%, P < 0.001). Despite increased utilization of adjuvant therapies (54.4% versus 45.6% versus 42.0%, P < 0.001), patients with head PDAC had inferior OS compared with those with body and tail tumors (P < 0.001). Conclusions: When examining patients with PDAC undergoing resection, tumor localization to the head is associated with improved resectability because they present earlier. Of resected PDACs, however, those localized to the head have worse OS compared with body and tail tumors. This discrepancy may represent a combination of lead time and selection biases and biologic differences between tumor sites. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Overall survival; Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; Pancreatic head; Tumor location",Article,Scopus

Several well-known agonists of specific bitter taste receptors have been found to exhibit anti-cancer effects. For example, N-C=S-containing compounds, such as allyl-isothiocyanates, have shown cancer chemo-preventive effects. It is worth noting that human T2R38 receptor is specific for compounds containing N-C=S moiety. Here, a bioinspired cell-based bioelctronic tongue (BioET) is developed for the high-specificity isothiocyanate-induced bitter detection, utilizing human Caco-2 cells as a primary sensing element and interdigitated impedance sensor as a secondary transducer. As an intestinal carcinoma cell line, Caco-2 endogenously expresses human bitter receptor T2R38, and the activation of T2R38 induces the changes of cellular morphology which can be detected by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). After configuration and optimization of parameters including timing of compound administration and cell density, quantitative bitter evaluation models were built for two well-known bitter compounds, phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and propylthiouracil (PROP). The bitter specific detection of this BioET is inhibited by probenecid and U-73122, and is not elicited by other taste modalities or bitter ligands that do not activate T2R38. Moreover, by combining different computational tools, we designed a ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) protocol to select ligands that are likely to activate T2R38 receptor. Three computationally predicted agonists of T2R38 were selected using the LBVS protocol, and the BioET presented response to the predicted agonists, validating the capability of the LBVS protocol. This study suggests this unique cell-based BioET paves a general and promising way to specifically detect N-C=S-containing compounds that can be used for pharmaceutical study and drug development. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bioinspired in vitro bioelectronic tongue; Caco-2 cells; Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing; Human T2R38 receptor; N‐C=S‐containing compounds",Article,Scopus

A common reason for studying nanoparticle filtration is their potential to be used as surrogates for the various types of viruses in water treatment and bioprocessing applications. Although the effect of adding surfactants to stabilize nanoparticle suspension has been explored for a number of different applications, there is significant variation in the amounts and types of surfactants used in those studies. In this study, we used three different sizes (59, 188, and 490 nm) of spherical fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles (PNPs) – the two smaller sizes were chosen to mimic the width and length of Rhabdovirus, a bullet-shaped enveloped virus that is currently being studied as bio-therapeutic for the treatment of cancer.

Here, MoS 2 flakes were stabilized with different small functional biomolecules such as adenosine monophosphate (AMP), guanosine monophosphate (GMP) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) through the strong nucleotide−MoS 2 interaction of Lewis acid-base type, rather than just on the weak dispersive and hydrophobic forces commonly associated with the use of many surfactants.

This study was to investigate the predictive value of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in predicting patients with low risk EC, and to identify an optimum ADC measurement for preoperative assessment. Materials and methods: Eighty-one patients with stage I EC who underwent diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at 1.5T were included and divided into low group and intermediate-high risk group based on the ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO classification. Clinical indexes, conventional MRI parameters, minimum ADC values (minADC), mean ADC values (meanADC) and relative ADC values (rADC) were compared between those two groups. rADC was calculated using the equation ADC (cancer)/ADC (reference) with the obturator internus muscle as reference. The optimal ADC measurement and cut-off ADC value for low risk EC were calculated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: The low risk group had significantly higher meanADC, minADC, and rADC values than did the intermediate-high risk group (1.095 vs. 0.902 × 10 −3 mm 2 /s, 0.755 vs. 0.657 × 10 −3 mm 2 /s, 0.754 vs. 0.603, respectively). In assessments of low risk EC patients, the area under the curve (AUC) values for meanADC, minADC, and rADC were 0.840 (95%CI, 0.749,0.931), 0.681 (95% CI: 0.561,0.800), and 0.876(95% CI: 0.798,0.954), respectively. The optimal cut-off rADC value for prediction was 0.669, the maximum Youden index, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values were 0.683, 81.8%, 86.5%, and 84.0%, respectively. Conclusions: rADC is superior to minADC and meanADC for predicting patients with low risk EC, and could potentially aid to the surgical management of these patients in avoiding unnecessary lymphadenectomy. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Apparent diffusion coefficient; Endometrial carcinoma; Lymphadenectomy; Risk classification",Article,Scopus

Short- and long-term bowel motility disorders after D3 extended mesenterectomy with consecutive superior mesenteric plexus transection are studied. Methods: Patients without pre-existing motility disorders undergoing D3 extended mesenterectomy were examined 3 times using the wireless motility capsule: before, at 3 wk, and 6 mo after surgery. Segmental transit times and contractility were analyzed using mixed effect modeling. Correlation between contractility and transit time was assessed by the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: Fifteen patients (4 men), with median age 62 y, were included. Mean values for the three consecutive examinations are as follows. Gastric transit time increased from 237 to 402 and 403 min, respectively. Small bowel transit time decreased from 246 to 158 (P < 0.01) and 199 (P = 0.03) min, respectively. Colonic transit time decreased from 1742 to 1450 and 1110 (P = 0.02) min, respectively. Gastric contractions per minute (CPM) varied from 1.73 to 1.05 (P = 0.01) and 2.47 (P < 0.01), respectively. Small bowel CPM decreased from 3.43 to 2.68 and 3.34, respectively. Colonic CPM ranged from 1.59 to 1.45 and 1.91 (P = 0.08), respectively.

The GRBAS (grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, strain) scale is used as an acoustic diagnostic method for these diseases, but its objectivity is not well established. Instead, more accurate diagnosis may be possible by capturing the waveform of the volume velocity at the vocal cords. The aim of this study is to enable voice disturbances to be diagnosed by identifying the sound-source waveform from voice measurements. For acoustic analysis of the vocal tract, we modeled the air inside it as concentrated masses connected by linear springs and dampers. We identified the shape of the vocal tract by making the natural frequencies of the analytical model correspond to the measured formant frequencies, and we calculated the sound-source waveform from the measured voice waveform. To assess the validity of the model, we measured actual voices and used the model to identify the vocal tract shapes and corresponding sound-source waveforms. The identified waveforms have an asymmetrical triangular form, which is a feature of actual human sound-source waveforms. Local solutions allow multiple vocal tract shapes to be identified from a single sample. However, mathematical analysis showed that these differ only in the amplitude of the sound-source waveform, which does not affect the waveform shape. Furthermore, we built an experimental device that simulates the human voice mechanism and comprises an acrylic vocal tract and a piston. We confirmed that the identified sound sources are similar to measured sound sources. We therefore conclude that our proposed methods are valid. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Concentrated mass model; Speech production; Vocal cords; Vocal tract; Voice disturbance",Article,Scopus

Cancer dormancy is a state in which cancer cells have an intrinsic rate of reduced proliferation over a period of time, after which they arise with an accelerated growth rate, usually triggering metastases. This work investigates via fractional calculus two proposed ordinary differential equation systems via fractional calculus, which address dynamics between tumor cells and the immune system. Analyses and comparison processes are performed through an analytical study about the equilibrium points of each model and numerical simulations by the Nonstandard Finite Difference (NSFD) method. The analytical and numerical results show two important behaviors associated with tumor dormancy. The first refers to qualitative changes in the stability of an equilibrium point, which strongly depend on the order of the derivative and represent scenarios where there is no cancer escape. The second behavior refers to changes in the damping of some solutions, which can represent longer periods of time to exit the state of dormancy. In this case, different orders used in the derivatives are investigated, as well as their influence on the behavior of the solutions against the main parameters of the model. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Caputo derivatives; Fractional stability; Immune system; Tumor dormancy",Article,Scopus

Ideal cancer immunotherapies induce a patient's immune system to kill their own cancer and develop long-lasting immunity. Research has demonstrated a critical requirement for CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in achieving durable responses. In the path to the clinic, researchers require robust tools to effectively evaluate the capacity for immunotherapies to generate adaptive anti-tumor responses. To study functional tumor-specific T cells, researchers have relied on targeting tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) or the inclusion of surrogate transgenes in pre-clinical models, which facilitate detection of T cells by using the targeted antigen(s) in peptide re-stimulation or tetramer-staining assays. Unfortunately, many pre-clinical models lack a defined TAA, and epitope mapping of TAAs is costly. Surrogate transgenes can alter tumor engraftment and influence the immunogenicity of tumors, making them less relevant to clinical tumors. Further, some researchers prefer to develop therapies that do not rely on pre-defined TAAs. Here, we describe a method to exploit major histocompatibility complex expression on murine cancer cell lines in a co-culture assay to detect T cells responding to bulk, undefined, tumor antigens.

When compared with direct incubation of EVs with miRNA, mild electroporation allowed more efficient loading and better protection of miRNA from RNase degradation. Moreover, electroporation preserved the naive vesicle cargo, including RNAs and proteins, and their ability to be taken up by target cells, supporting the absence of vesicle damage.

Here, we investigated whether this reducing effect could occur in a different AD mouse model. We investigated urethane-induced (1 mg/g) lung tumor development and melanoma growth in Swedish amyloid precursor protein (SwAPP) transgenic mice. The expression of chitinase-3-like-1 (Chi3L1) increased during lung tumor development and melanoma growth, which was accompanied by an increase in the activity of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and the downregulation of miRNA342-3p in wild-type mice. Like tumor development, the expression of Chi3L1 and STAT3 activity was reduced in the SwAPP mice, whereas the expression of miRNA342-3p was upregulated. In addition, Chi3L1 knockdown in the lung cancer and melanoma tissues reduced cancer cell growth and STAT3 activity but enhanced miRNA342-3p expression. However, the miRNA342-3p mimic decreased Chi3L1 expression, cancer cell growth, and STAT3 activity. Moreover, a STAT3 inhibitor reduced Chi3L1 expression and cancer cell growth but enhanced miRNA342-3p expression. These data showed that lung tumor development was reduced through the decrease of Chi3L1 expression via the STAT3-dependent upregulation of miRNA342-3p.

This study is supposed to reveal the effects of lncRNA PVT1 on the radiosensitivity of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) via the microRNA (miR)-424-5p/lncRNA PVT1/CARM1 signaling pathway. Differentially expressed lncRNA was filtrated. The co-expressed gene of lncRNA was predicted, and gene ontology analysis was performed to find out the genes associated with NSCLC radiosensitivity. The miR that was combined with lncRNA and mRNA was filtrated. Two cell lines with the highest expressed PVT1 were selected, followed by transfection with a series of different mimic, inhibitor, or siRNA. RIP assay was employed for the interaction between PVT1 and CARM1. The regulatory effect of miR-424-5p on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cycle, and apoptosis was investigated. PVT1 was the most remarkable lncRNA that upregulated in NSCLC. CARM1 co-expressed with lncRNA PVT1 and associated with NSCLC radiosensitivity. Both lncRNA PVT1 and CARM1 can combine with miR-424-5p. Increased PVT1, CARM1, MMP-2, MMP-9, and Bcl-2 and decreased miR-424-5p and Bax were found in NSCLC tissues. PVT1 was targeted by miR-424-5p. After silencing of PVT1 or overexpressed miR-424-5p, decreased PVT1, CARM1, MMP-2, MMP-9, and Bcl-2 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion but promoted miR-424-5p, Bax, and cell apoptosis.

Downexpression of miR-582-3p and miR-582-5p strongly and positively correlated with advanced clinicopathological characteristics and shorter bone metastasis-free survival in PCa patients. Upregulating miR-582-3p and miR-582-5p inhibited invasion and migration abilities of PCa cells in vitro, as well as repressed bone metastasis in vivo. Our results further revealed that miR-582-3p and miR-582-5p attenuated bone metastasis of PCa via inhibiting transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling by simultaneously targeting several components of TGF-β signaling, including SMAD2, SMAD4, TGF-β receptor I (TGFBRI), and TGFBRII.

This work explores Rhus punjabensis extract potential as both reducing and capping agent for phytomediated synthesis of NPs from ferric chloride precursor. The structural, morphological and compositional investigations were carried out with XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS, and FFT. The synthesized NPs were hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ) with rhombohedral crystal structure of an approximate size of 41.5 ± 5 nm. TEM, FTIR, and TG/DTA indicated phase-pure Fe 2 O 3 formation with controlled size through use of capping agent. Biological activities depict that synthesized NPs had free radical scavenging, antioxidative potential and reducing power activities. These activities are due to phenolic and flavonoid like properties by attachment of different functional groups on the surface of NPs. The NPs exhibited significant Antileishmanial, antibacterial and protein kinase inhibition activities as compared with the corresponding plant extract. NPs depicted cytotoxic effect against HL-60 leukemic and DU-145 prostate cancer cell lines with ED 50 values of 11.9 and 12.79 μg/ml, respectively.

The compounds 3a, 3b and 5b show high affinity toward Htelo, c-myc and c-kit G-quadruplexes (K a &gt; 4.42 × 10 6 M −1 ), and exhibit more than 40-fold selectivity for the quadruplex versus CT DNA.

Methods: Cancer burden statistics were retrieved from GLOBOCAN-2018 and Statistics Korea. HPV disease burden was assessed via systematic review. Vaccine types relative contribution (RC) was estimated using data from an international project using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens. Results: Despite a downtrend in cervical cancer in recent years, Korean rates remain high. In contrast, oropharyngeal cancer incidence has gradually increased and other anogenital cancers remain rare. In Korea, HPV prevalence in general population is around 20%. In cervical cancer, RC of HPVs 16/18 (74.0%) increased to 92.0% when including HPVs 31/33/45/52/58. Limited information was available for other HPV-related cancer sites. Regarding prevention, since the inclusion of the HPV vaccine into the National Immunization Program, almost half (49%) of the target cohort in 2016 had received the first dose of vaccine. Further, percentage of women screened with pap has increased from 41.1%-2009 to 53.0%-2016. Conclusions: HPV-related disease burden in Korea is significant.

They show a strong and probably causal relationship between the participation in clinical research in hospitals and the outcomes for patients with the disease under study in those hospitals. Also, institutions that are active in clinical trials appear to take up well evidenced innovations more rapidly than those which are not so engaged.

Epidemiological data on the rate of cancer incidence in Brazil appears not to have a strong impact on government policies to fund research and innovation in health, particularly in oncology. This study aimed to verify this suspicion by retrospectively analysing data from the Brazilian government's Financier of Studies and Projects (Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos, FINEP) and The National Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial, INPI) on cancer research and innovation in Brazil from 1998 to 2013. Our results indicated that, in the study period, the increased rate of cancer incidence in Brazil was not accompanied by government funding for cancer research since only 9% of the budget approved to health research, and innovation, was spent on cancer research. In addition, the number of projects approved for developing infrastructure to support cancer research was limited, corresponding to 0.46% of the total budget. The number of applications for registration of patents of chemical and biotechnological drugs for cancer showed a reduction, reflecting the low investment in oncology. In conclusion, there are deficits in governmental funding of cancer research and innovation in Brazil.

MicroRNAs (miRs) are involved in the progression and development of cervical cancer. This study aimed to explore the effect of miR-99b-5p (miR-99b) on invasion and migration in cervical cancer through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. The microarray-based analysis was used to screen out differentially expressed miRNAs. Expression of miR-99b, PI3K, AKT, mTOR, and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) was determined in both cervical cancer tissues and paracancerous tissues. Next, alteration of miR-99b expression in cervical cancer was conducted to evaluate levels of PI3K, AKT, mTOR, p70S6K matrix metallopeptidase 2, epithelial cell adhesion molecule, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1, as well as the effect of miR-99b on cell proliferation, invasion, migration, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis. The results demonstrated that miR-99b expression was decreased and levels of PI3K, AKT, mTOR, and p70S6K were elevated in cervical cancer tissues. More important, overexpressed miR-99b repressed the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, blocked cell cycle entry, and promoted apoptosis in cervical cancer. These results indicate that miR-99b attenuates the migration and invasion of human cervical cancer cells through downregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which provides a therapeutic approach for cervical cancer treatment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cell invasion; cell migration; cervical cancer; microRNA-99b; PI3K/AKT/mTOR; signaling pathway",Article,Scopus

RUNX1 controls the expression of genes essential for proper development in many cell lineages and tissues including blood, bone, cartilage, hair follicles, and mammary glands. Compromised RUNX1 regulation is associated with many cancers. In this review, we highlight evidence for RUNX1 control in both invertebrate and mammalian development and recent novel findings of perturbed RUNX1 control in breast cancer that has implications for other solid tumors. As RUNX1 is essential for definitive hematopoiesis, RUNX1 mutations in hematopoietic lineage cells have been implicated in the etiology of several leukemias. Studies of solid tumors have revealed a context-dependent function for RUNX1 either as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor. These RUNX1 functions have been reported for breast, prostate, lung, and skin cancers that are related to cancer subtypes and different stages of tumor development. Growing evidence suggests that RUNX1 suppresses aggressiveness in most breast cancer subtypes particularly in the early stage of tumorigenesis. Several studies have identified RUNX1 suppression of the breast cancer epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Most recently, RUNX1 repression of cancer stem cells and tumorsphere formation was reported for breast cancer. It is anticipated that these new discoveries of the context-dependent diversity of RUNX1 functions will lead to innovative therapeutic strategies for the intervention of cancer and other abnormalities of normal tissues. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","breast cancer; cancer; hematopoiesis; leukemia; mammary gland development; RUNX1",Review,Scopus

CSCs are identified from the expression of cell surface markers, which is tumor-type dependent. The transition between CSCs with cancer cells and other non-CSCs occurs in cancers, which is possibly under the control of signals from CSCs and tumor microenvironment (TME), including CSC niche. Cancer-associated fibroblasts are among the most influential cells for promoting both differentiation of CSCs and dedifferentiation of non-CSCs toward attaining a CSC-like phenotype.

In pancreatic cancer samples, downregulation of CYLD expression resulted from a loss in the copy number of the CYLD gene; additionally, reduced expression of CYLD negatively correlated with the clinicopathological parameters. Further study demonstrated that CYLD deficiency promoted colony formation in vitro and pancreatic cancer growth in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that CYLD is essential for spindle orientation and properly oriented cell division; CYLD deficiency resulted in a substantial increase in chromosome missegregation.

Sirt1 and CD36 both exert an essential role toward the oncogenic signaling in breast cancer cells. As reported, the adrenergic signaling could promote the malignancy of breast cancer. This study focuses specifically on the role of Sirt1/CD36 in the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells and also investigates their response to the α2-adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine (Dex). Materials and Methods: Expression of Sirt1 and CD36 was measured in breast cancer tissue by immunohistochemistry. We cultured MCF7 cells and treated cells with resveratrol (RSV) or Dex. Western blot analysis was performed to quantify the protein expression levels. The methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was applied to detect cell proliferation. Results: Compared with normal adjacent tissues, Sirt1 increased and CD36 decreased in cancer tissues. RSV, a Sirt1 activator, increased the proliferation of MCF-7 cells at low concentration but exerted cytotoxicity effect at higher concentration. Sirt1 activation increased the expression of CD36 at higher concentration. Dex treatment gradually increased the proliferation of MCF7 cells in a dose-dependent manner and downregulated the expression of Sirt1/CD36. Interestingly, overexpression of Sirt1 via RSV pretreatment could suppress Dex-stimulated proliferation of breast cancer, accompanied with CD36 upregulation. Conclusions: though expression of Sirt1 increased in breast cancer progression, overexpression of Sirt1 could inhibit MCF7 proliferation, which may be associated with CD36 upregulation. In addition, the promotion effect of Dex on MCF7 cells, which may be associated with the Sirt1/CD36 inhibition, could be weakened by Sirt1 activation via RSV. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Breast cancer; CD36; Dexmedetomidine; Resveratrol; Sirt1",Article,Scopus

Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to study predictors of IBR and any breast reconstruction. Results: Of 293 mastectomy patients, the rate of any breast reconstruction at the private cancer (56.6%) center was higher than that at the public hospital (36.2%). IBR rates for the private cancer center (93.6%) and for patients with private insurance were higher than for the public hospital (40.8%) and likewise for those without insurance (86.7% versus 45.5%).

Taken together, our results proved that lncRNA–CDC6 could function as ceRNA and promote the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer cells, which provided a novel prognostic marker for breast cancers in clinic. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","breast cancer; lncRNA–CDC6; metastasis; miR-215; proliferation",Article,Scopus

Decreased expression of long noncoding RNA growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) is found in human cervical cancer tissues and associated with poor prognosis. However, the studies on associations between GAS5 level and malignant phenotypes, as well as sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drug in cervical cancer cells are limited. In this study, overexpression of GAS5 in cervical cancer cells resulted in prohibited cell proliferation and colony formation, which were promoted by siGAS5. Enhanced GAS5 increased cell percentage in the G0/G1 phase and decreased cells percentage in the S phase, whereas reduced expression did not. The malignant behaviors of cervical cancer cells, manifested by cell migration and invasion, could be weakened by the GAS5 overexpression and enhanced by siGAS5. Furthermore, in cisplatin-induced cell, overexpression of GAS5 reduced cells viability and enhanced apoptosis, whereas in cells transfected with siGAS5, apoptosis eliminated. We have reported the upregulation of microRNA-21 (miR-21) and its oncogenetic roles in cervical cancer previously. In this study, we found the negative relationship between the GAS5 and miR-21. Moreover, the decrease of miR-21 associated proteins phosphorylated STAT3 and E2F3 was seen in GAS5 overexpressed cells, both of which could be increased by siGAS5. The GAS5 deficiency also reduced miR-21 target proteins TIMP3 and PDCD4 expressions. Taken together, the GAS5 expression level is inversely associated with malignancy, but positively associated with sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, suggesting that GAS5 could be a biomarker of cisplatin-resistance in clinical therapy of human cervical cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cervical cancer; cisplatin; growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5); miR-21; STAT3 signaling",Article,Scopus

The prepared nanocomposite conjugated with folic acid (FA), as a cancer cell-targeting ligand, and a miniaturized electrochemical cell for cancer cell detection was designed. In this strategy OPD could oxidize in the presence of H 2 O 2 on the surface of working electrode, which produced an electrochemical signal.

Recent advances in the genetic basis of breast cancer have benefitted the development of gene-based medicines and therapies. Tissue engineering technologies, including tissue decellularizations and reconstructions, are potential therapeutic alternatives for cancer research and tissue regeneration. In our study, human breast cancer biopsies were decellularized by a detergent technique, with sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES) solution, for the first time. And the decellularization process was optimized to maximally maintain tissue microarchitectures and extracellular matrix (ECM) components with minimal DNA compounds preserved. Histology analysis and DNA quantification results confirmed the decellularization effect with maximal genetic compounds removal. Quantification, immunofluorescence, and histology analyses demonstrated better preservation of ECM components in 0.5% SLES-treated scaffolds. Scaffolds seeded with MCF-7 cells demonstrated the process of cell recellularization in vitro, with increased cell migration, proliferation, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. When treated with 5-fluorouracil, the expressions of stem cell markers, including Oct4, Sox2, and CD49F, were maximally maintained in the recellularized scaffold with decreased apoptosis rates compared with monolayer cells. These results showed that the decellularized breast scaffold model with SLES treatments would help to simulate the pathogenesis of breast cancer in vitro. And we hope that this model could further accelerate the development of effective therapies for breast cancer and benefit drug screenings. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","3D in vitro culture; decellularization; epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT); extracellular matrix (ECM); sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES)",Article,Scopus

It is a complex disease that is influenced by multiple factors. It is also a common gynecological disorder and affects approximately 10–15% of all women of reproductive age. Recent molecular and pathological studies indicate that endometriosis may serve as a precursor of ovarian cancer (endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer, EAOC), particularly endometrioid and clear cell ovarian cancers. Although histological and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that endometriosis has a malignant potential, the molecular mechanism that underlies the malignant transformation of endometriosis is still controversial, and the precise mechanism of carcinogenesis must be fully elucidated. Currently, the development and improvement of a new sequencing technology, next-generation sequencing (NGS), has been increasingly relevant in cancer genomics research. Recently, NGS has also been utilized in clinical oncology to advance the personalized treatment of cancer. In addition, the sensitivity, speed, and cost make NGS a highly attractive platform compared to other sequencing modalities. For this reason, NGS may lead to the identification of driver mutations and underlying pathways associated with EAOC. Here, we present an overview of the molecular pathways that have led to the current opinions on the relationship between endometriosis and ovarian cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Endometriosis; Endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer; Gene mutations; Malignant transformation; Next-generation sequencing",Review,Scopus

In this paper, a fast NQO1 responsive fluorescence probe SYZ-30 containing quinone acid and 7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (NBD) fluorophore is constructed. The probe could selectively respond to NQO1 and rapidly emit strong fluorescence in vitro within only 5 min. Notably, the peak fluorescent intensities at 550 nm showed a linear relationship with NQO1 concentrations in the range of 3–30 ng/ml and limit of detection (LOD) was 0.0667 ng/ml. Furthermore, it was validated that the probe has good biocompatibility and could be applied for bio-imaging in NQO1 over-expressed cancer cells, together with its mitochondria targeting ability. Importantly, confocal fluorescence imaging confirmed the NQO1 detection ability on cellular level, which can be used for real-time detection of several cancer subtypes like adenocarcinoma.

Furthermore hypothermia is the far less studied conditions in cancer cell systems. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are primary heat response regulators. Several studies have reported key roles of HSP-90 in neoplasias. However, the role of HSP-70 transcripts in cancer cells during hypo and hyperthermic exposure remains understudied. Methods: In present study, the role of HSP-70 gene transcripts such as HSPA1A, HSPA4, HSPA8, HSPA9 and HSPA14 in two human breast cancer cell lines such as MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 during direct exposure to hypo and hyperthermia (ranging from 33 °C to 42 °C) has been explored in time dependent manner. Results: Both the cancer cell lines showed significant changes in cell survival, proliferation and apoptosis post-hypo and hyperthermic exposure. Relative gene expression analysis showed significantly elevated expression of HSP-70 transcripts more specifically HSPA8 and HSPA14 post-hyperthermia exposure. Two different proliferative natures of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines showed significant variation in their transcripts expression suggesting that the HSP-70 genes expression may vary critically in normal and aggressive tumor environment.

By the model of cervical cancer, here we focus on the cooperative regulation of SOCE by STIM proteins and their distinct roles in cellular function. Immunofluorescent stainings of surgical specimens of cervical cancer show that STIM1 and STIM2 are abundant in tumor tissues, but STIM1 is the major ER Ca 2+ sensor identified in the invasive front of cancer tissues.

Regarding cellular function, STIM1 and STIM2 are necessary for cell proliferation, whereas STIM1 is the dominant ER Ca 2+ sensor involved in cell migration. During SOCE, STIM1 is aggregated and translocated towards the Orai1-containing plasma membrane in association with the microtubule plus-end binding protein EB1.

However, improved mechanistic insight may lead to novel therapeutic strategies. miR-142-3p belongs to the miR-142 family and is involved in pathogenesis and metastasis of various types of malignancies by targeting several important messenger RNAs (mRNAs) including Bach-1. This is especially true for breast cancer, where Bach-1 is involved in the metastatic spread by deregulation of metastasis-associated genes. Methods: In this study, we collected 24 breast cancer tissues with 24 adjusted normal tissues to measure the expression levels of miR-142-3p and Bach-1 mRNA using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and IHC. miR-142-3p targeting of Bach-1 expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells was evaluated using bioinformatics, qRT-PCR and western blot analyses. The cellular proliferation, invasion, and migration were assessed by MTT, transwell matrigel and wound healing assay and the EMT-associated proteins C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR-4), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) were analyzed by western blot analysis. Also, the expression levels of tumor suppressors including miR-330, miR-145, and miR-34a were estimated by qRT-PCR. Results: Analysis of paired specimens of primary malignant and normal tissues showed that miR-142-3p was downregulated, while Bach-1 mRNA and protein both were overexpressed in the breast cancer tumors. This inverse relationship was confirmed by cell line experiments demonstrating that miR-142-3p expression reduced Bach-1 mRNA levels. Furthermore, replacement of miR-142-3p could inhibit the proliferation, invasion, and migration in breast cancer potentially by targeting of Bach-1 mRNA and subsequent inhibition of CXCR4, MMP9, and VEGFR protein expressions. In addition, induction of miR-142-3p could upregulate tumor suppressor miRNAs, including miR-330, miR-145, and miR34a. Conclusion: For the first time, our results revealed that miR-142-3p could target Bach-1in breast cancer cells leading to the reduction of EMT-related proteins and reduced cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. The results also demonstrated that miR-142-3p could regulate important tumor suppressor miRNAs in breast cancer cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that miR-142-3p could be a good candidate for the targeted therapy of breast cancer, especially for the invasive type. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Bach-1; breast cancer; invasion; migration; miR-142-3p",Article,Scopus

Recently, atomic structures of the transmembrane domains of mouse TMEM16A (mTMEM16A) were determined by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. This gives us a solid ground to discuss the electrophysiological properties and functions of TMEM16A. TMEM16A is reported to be dually regulated by Ca 2+ and voltage. In addition, the dysfunction of TMEM16A has been found to be involved in many diseases including cystic fibrosis, various cancers, hypertension, and gastrointestinal motility disorders. TMEM16A is overexpressed in many cancers, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors, gastric cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), colon cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and esophageal cancer. Furthermore, overexpression of TMEM16A is related to the occurrence, proliferation, and migration of tumor cells. To date, several studies have shown that many natural compounds and synthetic compounds have regulatory effects on TMEM16A. These small molecule compounds might be novel drugs for the treatment of diseases caused by TMEM16A dysfunction in the future. In addition, recent studies have shown that TMEM16A plays different roles in different diseases through different signal transduction pathways.

Notably, in several tumors a strong deregulation of miRNAs is observed, supporting proliferation, invasion, and metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells. Here we demonstrated that cancer-associated fibroblasts induce a downregulation of miR-1247 in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. We proved that miR-1247 repression is functional for the achievement of EMT and increased cell invasion as well as stemness traits. These phenomena contribute to promote the metastatic potential of PCa cells as demonstrated by increased lung colonization in in vivo experiments. Moreover, as a consequence of miR-1247 downregulation, we observed a correlated increased expression level of neuropilin-1, a miR-1247 target involved as a coreceptor in the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling.

Materials and methods: National Cancer Database (NCDB) data from 2004 to 2014 of all diagnoses of appendiceal cancers were examined. We examined treatment modalities, as well as demographic, tumor-specific, and survival data. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the patient cohort most likely to receive CRS/PIC. Kaplan–Meier was used to estimate survival for all treatment groups. Significance was evaluated at P ≤ 0.05. Results: We analyzed data on 18,055 patients. Nine thousand nine hundred ninety-two (55.3%) were treated with surgery only, 5848 (32.4%) received surgery and systemic chemotherapy, 1393 (7.71%) received CRS/PIC, 520 (2.88%) received chemotherapy alone, and 302 (1.67%) received neither surgery nor chemotherapy.

The interesting point is that apoptotic Tregs are stronger than their live counterparts for suppressing responses from immune system. Tregs within the tumor microenvironment have extensive positive cross-talks with other immunosuppressive cells including cancer-associated fibroblasts, cancer cells, macrophage type 2 cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and they have negative interactions with immunostimulatory cells including cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer cells. A wide variety of markers are expressed in Tregs, among them forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) is the most specific marker and the master regulator of these cells. Multiple signals are activated by Tregs including transforming growth factor-β, signal transducer and activator of transcription, and mTORC1. Treg reprogramming from an immunosuppressive to immunostimulatory proinflammatory phenotype is critical for increasing the efficacy of immunotherapy. This would be applicable through selective suppression of tumor-bearing receptors in Tregs, including FOXP3, programmed death-1, T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3, and CTL-associated antigen-4, among others. Intratumoral Tregs can also be targeted by increasing the ratio for CTL/Treg. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cancer cell; cyclooxygenase-2; forkhead box P3; immunosuppression; PD-1; regulatory T cell; signal transducer and activator of transcription; transforming growth factor-β; tumor microenvironment",Review,Scopus

The increase in loading and release of curcumin nanoparticles indirectly translates to enhanced anti-cancer effect. Owing to the hydrophobic characteristics of curcumin which have resulted in low bioavailability in cancer cells, the engineering curcumin into nanoparticles is therefore a viable solution to overcomes its limitation. In order to maintain a sustained release profile of curcumin nanoparticles, curcumin nanoparticles were loaded (Cur-NPs) onto hydroxyapatite (HA) via physical adsorption. To regulate the adsorption capacity of Cur-NPs onto HA, we functionalized HA with different carboxylic acids (lactic acid, tartaric acid and citric acid). The presence of carboxylic groups on HA significantly affected the binding and the release profile of Cur-NPs. The effects of Cur-NPs loaded HA were evaluated on breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), which included cell proliferation, cellular uptake of Cur-NPs, apoptosis and cell cycle analysis. The results showed that carboxylic acid-functionalized HA demonstrated higher anti-proliferating activity and time dependent cytoplasmic uptake of Cur-NPs in MCF-7 cells compared to unmodified HA. In addition, Cur-NPs loaded on functionalized HA induced higher apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 cells compared to unmodified HA. The present study indicates that the delivery of Cur-NPs to breast cancer using carboxylic acid-functionalized HA carrier could improve their anti-cancer activities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Breast cancer; Carboxylic acid; Curcumin; Hydroxyapatite; Nanoparticle",Article,Scopus

Methods: A next-generation sequencing assay was used to whole-genome sequence 7116 HPV16-positive cervical samples from well-characterised international epidemiological studies, including 2076 controls, 1878 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 186 adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous cell carcinoma (ADC), and to assign HPV16 sub-lineage. Logistic regression was used to estimate region-stratified country-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95%CI. Results: A1 was the most globally widespread sub-lineage, with others showing stronger regional specificity (A3 and A4 for East Asia, B1–4 and C1–4 for Africa, D2 for the Americas, B4, C4 and D4 for North Africa). Increased cancer risks versus A1 were seen for A3, A4 and D (sub)lineages in regions where they were common: A3 in East Asia (OR=2.2, 95%CI:1.0–4.7); A4 in East Asia (6.6, 3.1–14.1) and North America (3.8, 1.7–8.3); and D in North (6.2, 4.1–9.3) and South/Central America (2.2, 0.8–5.7), where D lineages were also more frequent in ADC than SCC (3.2, 1.5–6.5; 12.1, 5.7–25.6, respectively). Conclusions: HPV16 genetic variation can strongly influence cervical cancer risk.

Furthermore, we assessed whether differences in screening participation between immigrants and Danish-born women were explained by sociodemographic or health-related characteristics, and examined predictors of participation among immigrants. Using high-quality registries, we identified women invited for cervical cancer screening during 2008–2009 and retrieved individual-level data on sociodemographic-, health- and immigration-related characteristics. A total of 610,907 women were followed for up to 2.9 years after screening invitation. We estimated the probability of participation using the Aalen-Johansen estimator and the hazard ratios (HRs) of participation using Cox regression. The probability of participation within follow-up was 74.5% (95% CI, 74.4%–74.6%) in Danish-born women; 61.2% (95% CI, 60.4%–62.1%) in Western immigrants; and 61.3% (95% CI, 60.9%–61.8%) in non-Western immigrants.

Substantial variation was seen between specific countries of origin. Differences in participation between immigrants and Danish-born women were not explained by sociodemographic or health-related characteristics. Predictors of low participation in immigrants included lower income, unemployment, being unmarried, having a history of schizophrenia or other psychoses, and ≤5 years’ stay in Denmark.

Previously, we reported a method for the direct isolation of human mature osteoblasts and indicated that osteoblasts were associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus-related signaling pathways. In addition, a recent report suggested that osteoblasts are involved in glucose metabolism. Thus, we sought to examine the effects of diabetes on osteoblast signaling in vivo. We recruited eight patients with type 2 diabetes and eight non-diabetic individuals. We isolated human mature osteoblasts from the resected femoral heads during orthopaedic surgery and extracted their RNA. We compared the gene expression between the two groups by RNA microarray and pathway analyses. Microarray analysis showed significant differences in 885 of 19,463 genes between the two groups (p < 0.05), and pathway analysis revealed that pathways related to cancer and the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway were significantly activated in the diabetes group (p < 0.01). These preliminary findings suggest that diabetes affects intracellular signaling in human mature osteoblasts and that osteoblasts might not only play a key role in the regulation of bone and glucose metabolism, but might also be related to cancer metabolism.

Methods: To analyze characteristics of patients who developed port site metastases after minimally invasive colectomy, a retrospective case series of a single institution from 2004 to 2017 was performed. The study included patients who had a minimally invasive resection of the primary colon cancer and subsequent cytoreduction and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC) for peritoneal metastases. Patient characteristics, histology, pathology, prior treatments, time between surgeries, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels and survival were reviewed. Results: There were 123 patients who had CRS/HIPEC and 13 of them had a history of laparoscopic or robotic colectomy followed by the development of port site disease. Four were females, nine were males. Median age was 48 years (range, 19–64). Eleven of 13 primary colon cancers were T3 or T4. Ten of 13 patients had no clinical evidence of peritoneal metastases at the time of initial resection. All 13 patients had metastatic deposits at port sites that were confirmed histopathologically at the time of CRS/HIPEC. Conclusions: Port site metastases were present concomitantly with peritoneal metastases in 13 patients. An advanced T-stage of disease occurred in 85% of patients.

We evaluated serum resistin levels in healthy individuals versus pancreatic cancer patients representing different tumor grades. In vitro mechanistic analysis involved MiaPaCa-2 and SW1990 cells. Resistin signaling depends on binding of resistin to its cognitive receptors. Therefore, we silenced adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), its two known receptors, individually as well as in combination, by short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Effect of resistin on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle, and sensitivity to gemcitabine was studied without or with silencing of resistin receptors CAP1 and/or TLR4. The results were also confirmed in vivo in mice xenografted with MiaPaCa-2 cells without or with receptor silencing. We report high resistin levels in pancreatic cancer patients which correlate positively with tumor grades. We observed a marked reduction in the resistin-induced proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle of pancreatic cancer cells MiaPaCa-2 and SW1990 when the receptors were silenced. The results were confirmed in vivo wherein resistin effects were significantly attenuated in MiaPaCa-2 xenografts with silenced receptors. The combined silencing of CAP1 and TLR4 was found to be most effective in vitro and in vivo. We found activation of STAT3 by resistin in vivo and in vitro which was dependent on the presence of CAP1 and TLR4. Further, resistin was found to induce resistance to gemcitabine through its receptors.

Next to these, utilizing the GP fitting approach, exposure buildup factors (EBF) of the drugs determined up to 40 mfp in the energy range 0.015–15 MeV. Experimental and theoretical results have been found to be in harmony. Oxaliplatin and Carboplatin have larger μ and Z eff and lower HVL values than the other drugs under study. The smallest EBF values are observed for Endoksan, Oxaliplatin and Carboplatin for all of the penetration depths.

Herein, we creatively reported a convenient method to synthesize the novel NPs as the substrate of SERS sensors, which possessed a gold nanobipyramid core and silver nanorod shell. These gold nanobipyramid core and silver nanorod shell NPs (Au NBP@Ag NRs) were further modified with 4-mercaptobenzoicacid (4-MBA, Raman reporter molecule) and then conjugated with reduced bovine serum albumin (rBSA) and folic acid (FA) on their surfaces, to finally acquire Au NBP@Ag NR-MBA-rBSA-FA nanoprobes. In this system, With the enhancement factor (EF) of Au NBP@Ag NRs was about 4 × 10 7 , it could significantly enhance Raman signal for Raman reporter molecules, and 4-MBA molecules performed high SERS signals based on their structures; the nanoprobes have favorable specificity and biocompatibility owing to the modification of rBSA which effectively avoided the nonspecific attachment of non-targeted cells. Moreover, the obtained SERS nanoprobes have excellent sensitivity for gastric cancer cells (MGC-803 cells) due to the conjugation of folic acid. Thus, the finally obtained Au NBP@Ag NR-MBA-rBSA-FA nanoprobes possess excellent detection efficiency for living MGC-803 cells. Therefore, our synthesized nanoprobes exhibit ultrasensitive SERS-activity, excellent specificity and superior cancer cells targeting ability, which could be applied for rapid identification and Raman imaging of living cancer cells via the SERS signal detection of the nanoprobes. © 2019","Au NBP@Ag NR-MBA-rBSA-FA nanoprobes; Living cells imaging; MGC-803; SERS",Article,Scopus

By means of CBMC, normal tissues with stronger fluorescence have been obviously pointed out from cancerous tissues. For cancer therapy, the probe CBMC could be an ideal candidate to evaluate tumor, because the tumor area would decrease while the normal tissue area would increase with treatment time.

Methods/design: The D-Health Trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Between February 2014 and May 2015, 21,315 people were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive monthly doses of either 60,000 IU of cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3 ) or placebo for five years. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality and the secondary outcomes are total cancer incidence and colorectal cancer incidence. These will be ascertained via linkage to death and cancer registries. The primary analysis for each outcome will follow an intention-to-treat approach; we will use flexible parametric survival models to investigate the association between supplementation and time to an event. We describe in detail sophisticated secondary analyses that consider non-compliance and contamination due to off-study supplementation.

Still, anti-tumor therapy in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation is a clinical challenge. Over the last years, successful chemotherapy has been reported, even in critically ill patients with infections and organ failure. In this report, we present a 42-year old male patient who later was been diagnosed for a highly-malignant lymphoma (Burkitt) developed an abdominal compartment syndrome due to ileus, ascites and progressive intestinal tumor manifestation. During the course, he required mechanical ventilation and developed several organ failures including need for renal replacement therapy. After laparotomy the abdomen was left open and managed by a vacuum dressing. The patient received systemic chemotherapy and broad anti-infective treatment in presence of markedly elevated markers of inflammation. Fortunately, he was successfully weaned from vasopressor and respiratory support. By obtaining negative fluid balances closure of the abdomen succeeded 18 days after laparotomy. The patient was transferred to the normal ward without organ dysfunction on day 27 and discharged home after a second cycle of chemotherapy.

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most frequent type of LC occurring in 85% of cases. Developing new methods for early detection of NSCLC could substantially increase the chances of survival and, therefore, is an urgent task for current research. Nowadays, explosion in nanotechnology offers unprecedented opportunities for therapeutics and diagnosis applications. In this context, exploiting the bio-nano-interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and biological fluids is an emerging field of research. Upon contact with biofluids, NPs are covered by a biomolecular coating referred to as “biomolecular corona” (BC). In this study, we exploited BC for discriminating between NSCLC patients and healthy volunteers. Blood samples from 10 NSCLC patients and 5 subjects without malignancy were allowed to interact with negatively charged lipid NPs, leading to the formation of a BC at the NP surface. After isolation, BCs were characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). We found that the BCs of NSCLC patients was significantly different from that of healthy individuals. Statistical analysis of SDS-PAGE results allowed discriminating between NSCLC cancer patients and healthy subjects with 80% specificity, 80% sensitivity and a total discriminate correctness rate of 80%. While the results of the present investigation cannot be conclusive due to the small size of the data set, we have shown that exploitation of the BC is a promising approach for the early diagnosis of NSCLC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","biomolecular corona; nanoparticle; non-small-cell lung cancer",Article,Scopus

We also estimated the number of, and adjusted disease prevalence ratios for, US adults aged ≥35 years with self-reported history of heart disease, stroke, or cancer attributable to cigar smoking. We found that prevalence of current cigar smoking has remained generally stable at around 2.3% among US adults aged ≥18 years between 2000 and 2015 but has increased among female and non-Hispanic black adults.

The main mechanisms of chemoresistance phenotype include increased expression and/or activated drug efflux pumps, altered DNA repair, altered metabolism of therapeutics as well as impaired apoptotic signaling pathways. Aberrant sphingolipid signaling has also recently received considerable attention in chemoresistance. Sphingolipid metabolites regulate main biological processes such as apoptosis, cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Two sphingosine kinases, SphK1 and SphK2, convert sphingosine to sphingosine-1-phosphate, an antiapoptotic bioactive lipid mediator. Numerous evidence has revealed the involvement of activated SphK1 in tumorigenesis and resistance, however, contradictory results have been found for the role of SphK2 in these functions. In some studies, overexpression of SphK2 suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis. In contrast, some others have shown cell proliferation and tumor promotion effect for SphK2. Our understanding of the role of SphK2 in cancer does not have a sufficient integrity. The main focus of this review will be on the re-evaluation of the role of SphK2 in cell death and chemoresistance in light of our new understanding of molecular targeted therapy. We will also highlight the connections between SphK2 and the DNA damage response. Finally, we will provide our insight into the regulatory mechanisms of SphKs by two main categories, micro and long, noncoding RNAs as the novel players of cancer chemoresistance. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","apoptosis; chemoresistance; DNA damage; SphK2",Review,Scopus

Therefore, the intracellular trafficking and the uptake mechanism of heparosan-based micelles by different tumor cells were investigated in this study. Heparosan-cholesterol amphipathic conjugates (KC) were constructed and doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded to prepare DOX/KC micelles. Different cancer cells were selected to find out the influence on DOX/KC uptake. There was an obvious difference in cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of DOX/KC in various cancer cells. Interestingly, DOX/KC micelles exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity against MGC80-3 cells and displayed highly cellular uptake by B16 cells. The results of the uptake mechanism showed that the internalization of DOX/KC micelles into MGC80-3 cells and A549 cells was mainly through clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis, while micropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis and clathrin/caveolae -independent multi-pathways all contributed to the uptake of micelles in B16 cells. Furthermore, after being internalized by MGC80-3 cells, DOX/KC could escape from the lysosome and simultaneously be transported into the nucleus and mitochondria resulting in the greatest cytotoxicity.

PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were systematically searched until November 2017. A total of 27 studies were found that met the inclusion criteria for cluster of differentiation 133 (CD133) and CD44 markers. Results indicated that either CD133 or CD44 positive cells caused about twofold increase in tumor volume compared with the negative cells (p &lt; 0.05). In two groups of cells derived from primary tumors and cell lines, CD133 + cells had 25 and 1.45 times higher tumor incidence potential than CD133 − cells, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Also, cohort evaluation showed that CD133 overexpression at protein level is a marker of poor overall survival in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. While CD44 + cells displayed twofold tumorigenicity compared with the negative cells (p &lt; 0.05), combination of CD44 and CD133 showed about sevenfold tumorigenicity potential (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the present meta-analysis suggests that CD133 is a robust biomarker to identify primary tumor CSLCs and can be proposed as a prognostic marker of CRC patient whereas it should be used with caution in cell lines. It seems to be more reliable to use CD133 in combination with CD44 as target biomarkers for the isolation of CR-CSLCs in both cell line and primary tumor cells populations. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cancer stem cell; CD marker; colorectal cancer; tumorigenicity",Review,Scopus

However, low physiological solubility and lack of selectivity towards cancer cells are the main limitations of their clinical use. Nanoparticles are being intensively explored as photosensitizer carriers for PDT to overcome these limitations. The aims of this work are to synthesize core-shell hybrid nanoparticles formed by a silica core and xylan carrying a 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-10,15,20-triphenylporphyrin (TPPOH) shell, and evaluate their anticancer activity. To afford drug-controlled incorporation and enhance blood circulation, TPPOH was covalently linked to xylan. Different xylans with degrees of substitution in TPPOH ranging from 0.034 to 1.11, were obtained and characterized. Then, the xylan-TPPOH conjugate (PX) was used to coat the silica nanoparticles (PX SNPs). The obtained nano-objects were characterized and their therapeutic potential for photodynamic therapy evaluated against colorectal cancer cell lines. in vitro analysis showed that PX SNPs were 40-fold and 10-fold more effective against HCT116 cells and HT-29 cells respectively compared to free TPPOH. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Colorectal cancer; Photodynamic therapy; Polysaccharides; Silica nanoparticles; Xylan",Article,Scopus

An increasing number of reports have demonstrated their essential regulatory roles in various biological processes and human diseases, including cancer. However, the role of circRNA in cervical cancer (CC) remains largely unknown. In the current study, we investigated the physiological functions of circ_0067934 during CC development and progression. We found that circ_0067934 was overexpressed in CC tissues and cell lines. Circ_0067934 upregulation was associated with advanced stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis in CC patients. Knockdown of circ_0067934 suppressed the proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of CC cells in vitro. Circ_0067934 loss also inhibited CC tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, silencing circ_0067934 increased miR-545 expression. MiR-545 repressed EIF3C expression through targeting its 3′-untranslated region. MiR-545 suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CC cells, whereas restoration of EIF3C could rescue the effects of circ_0067934 knockdown. Taken together, our findings revealed that circ_0067934 promotes CC progression via miR-545/EIF3C axis.

CRC is described as multifactorial disease. Among others, Glutathione S-transferases are known to act pro-carcinogenic in CRCs, however, they are needed for the conjugation between chemotherapeutics and a wide spectrum of xenobiotics. In this study, 70 patients with CRC and 85 healthy volunteers without any cancer history were genotyped. Polymorphism genotypes for the genes GSTP1, GSTT1 and GSTM1 were studied by polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and/or multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Our finding showed a significant risk for CRC associated with GSTP1 heterozygous Ile/Val (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 0.93–3.44; p = 0.009), while GSTP1 Val/Val homozygous was observed only in the CRC patients.

A retrospective secondary data analysis was conducted of men ages 55–69 without a history of prostate cancer using 2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data. The relationship between Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) questions captured in MEPS and PSA screening in the last two years were assessed using multiple logistic regression. The analysis was carried out in October 2018 at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. The final survey sample consisted of 1249 men that equated to 15,313,605.5 once weighted; 69.5% underwent PSA screening.

Here, we developed a novel anchor-like DNA (alDNA) electrochemical sensor for the detection of KRAS point mutation level (the concentration ratio of the specific KRAS point mutant DNA (M-DNA) to the total DNA (t-DNA) of both mutant and wild-type DNAs carrying the same allele). Compared to those conventional ligation-based DNA sensors, the proposed alDNA sensor achieved the one-step capture of both wild-type and mutant DNA, and the subsequent detection on one chip, which effectively decreased systematic errors from the uncertain differences on the interfacial structural and microenvironmental changes, improved the detection accuracy. Also, with the usage of formamide-NaCl solution, the whole detection process including the denaturation of double-stranded DNA was performed under mild temperature conditions (~40 °C). It greatly decreased the cost and improved the reproducibility and feasibility of the method. Based on it, the linear correlations with the logarithm of concentration in wide range from 0.1 pM to 10 nM for t-DNA and from 100 pM to 10 nM for M-DNA were achieved, respectively. The analysis of t-DNA- and M-DNA-spiked human serum samples revealed the high accuracy of the method. This alDNA sensor is convenient, low-cost and time-saving, with broad dynamic range, high sensitivity and selectivity. It can meet the demands of the clinical detection on the KRAS point mutation level in blood samples, which means significant for the earlier NSCLC diagnosis, individualized treatment, and therapeutic efficacy evaluation. © 2019","Dual-functional detection; Electrochemical biosensor; Formamide (FA); KRAS point mutation",Article,Scopus

This study aims to compare long-term outcomes of advanced stage p16 positive and negative OPSCCs, treated by surgical and non-surgical modalities. Methods: OPSCC patients from 1998 to 2012 were identified through a prospectively collected cancer registry. P16 immunohistochemistry was used as a surrogate marker for HPV-OPSCC. Overall survival (OS) and aspiration free survival (AFS) comparisons were made between patients treated with chemoradiation (CRT) versus primary surgery and radiation/chemoradiation (S+RT/CRT) at 5, 10 and 15 years post-treatment. Results: A total of 319 patients were included. P16 positive patients and non-smokers had significantly higher long-term (5, 10 and 15-year) OS. Smokers and p16 negative patients treated with S+RT/CRT had improved long-term OS compared to patients who received CRT. Smokers and p16 negative patients had lower long-term AFS. Multivariate analysis showed improved OS was associated with p16 positivity (HR 0.42, 0.28–0.61) and surgery (HR 0.47, 0.32–0.69), whereas lower OS was associated with ECOG ≥ 2 (HR 2.46, 1.61–3.77), smoking (HR 2.37, 1.41–3.99) and higher stage (HR 1.68, 1.05–2.68). Conclusions: In smokers and p16-negative OPSCC patients, primary surgery may be associated with improved long-term survival and dysphagia-related outcomes. © 2018",,Article,Scopus

The synthesized AuNPs size about 10–40 nm with mostly spherical and few triangular, and hexagonal shapes. Elemental composition and crystalline nature were confirmed by EDX and XRD, respectively. FTIR studies revealed the presence of plant materials on the surface of AuNPs, which could be responsible for formation of AuNPs. GC-MS analysis was utilized to determine the phytochemical composition of L. japonica flowers. The synthesized AuNPs were checked for the cytotoxic effect on normal embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) and cervix cancer (HeLa) cells. In conclusion, the normal cells were remaining unharmed while cancer cells growth inhibition was observed dose dependent. From immunofluorescent staining studies of HeLa cells, condensation and fragmentation of nuclear material were observed that indicates apoptotic cell death.

Nevertheless, the successful application of this strategy still depends on the development of nanocarriers for the safe delivery of siRNA into the diseased tissue, which mostly occurs by passive accumulation. When an external magnetic field is applied, magnetic nanoparticles biodistribution is partially modulated to favor accumulation in a target tissue. In this work we designed a novel magnetic responsive siRNA nanocarrier. The new delivery system is composed of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) coated with calcium phosphate (CaP) and PEG-polyanion block copolymers, which are known to be biocompatible. The nanoparticles presented rounded shape with small size and narrow distribution suitable for biomedical applications. TEM images showed dark spheres in the core surrounded by a lower electron density material in the corona. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) confirmed CaP-polymer coating of the magnetic core. In addition, the coating procedure did not affect the superparamagnetic property as showed using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). With a high loading efficiency (80%), the nanoparticles enhanced vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) silencing in breast cancer cells in vitro, at gene and protein levels (~60% and 40%, respectively), without associated toxicity.

This single-institutional phase II trial aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of RDG with lymph node dissection for clinical stage IA gastric cancer. Methods: The study included patients with clinical stage IA gastric cancer in the lower two-thirds of the stomach considered to be curatively resected via distal gastrectomy. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who developed intra-abdominal complications, requiring medical or interventional treatment. The planned sample size was 25, calculated based on an expected complication rate of 3% and a threshold complication rate of 15%, with a one-sided alpha of 10%, power of 70%. Results: Overall postoperative complications rate was 16%. The proportion of patients who developed intra-abdominal complications, requiring treatment was 0% (90% confidence interval, 0–9.8%). No patient developed in-hospital adverse events of grade 3 or higher. The short-term clinical outcomes were as follows: the median duration of postoperative hospital stay was 7 d, and 10 patients (40.0%) had a body temperature of 38°C or higher during their hospital stay. Conclusions: This trial confirmed the safety of RDG with limitation by the restriction of dedicated surgeons. A phase III trial to confirm the superiority of RDG to conventional laparoscopic distal gastrectomy is warranted. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Clinical trial; Gastric cancer; Intra-abdominal complication; Robotic gastrectomy; Safety",Article,Scopus

The present study is designed to define the exact role of LNY and LNR regarding the overall and specific survival of patients affected by oral cavity and oropharyngeal SCC. It has been registered on clinicaltrials.gov database (NCT03534778). Methods: This is a multicenter study involving tertiary care referral centers in Europe and North America. Patients affected by oral cavity, HPV+ and HPV- oropharyngeal SCC undergoing neck dissection will be consecutively enrolled and followed-up for up to 5 years. Patients and disease characteristic will be properly recorded and centrally analyzed. The primary end-point is to define reliable cut off-values for LNY and LNR which may serve as prognosticators of survival. This will be achieved through the use of ROC curves. Secondary outcomes will be the Overall survival (OS), Disease Specific Survival (DSS), and Progression Free Survival Hazard Ratios (HR) at 2-, 3- and 5 years, which will be evaluated through the Kaplan-Meier method and the difference in survival attested by the log-rank test.

To overcome this life frightening issue, therapeutic modalities such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, immune therapy, photothermal therapy, and photodynamic therapy have been developed and employed to fight against cancer. However, none of the above mentioned therapeutic modalities alone has been found efficient enough to eradicate cancerous tumor completely and to control recurrence of the tumor. This insufficient efficiency of any therapeutic modality, in a solo manner, can be enhanced using a combination of different modalities. For instance, a synergistic approach involving a combination of photodynamic therapy with other therapeutic modalities has the potential to kill cancerous cells completely or prevent recurrence. Therefore, herein, we focused on the synergistic approach involving different therapeutic modalities such as photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and radiothermal therapy. A combination of two or more therapeutic modalities could help to overcome shortcomings that an individual therapy failed to demonstrate on its own, especially in hypoxia (a low oxygen condition in the tumor environment).

The development of port site metastases after laparoscopy is a concern and a matter of debate due to theoretical iatrogenic disease spread. Port site resection (PSR) has been proposed as an option to avoid this scenario. Material and methods: One hundred and twenty-three patients with advanced ovarian cancer (FIGO III-IV) and with diagnostic laparoscopy were included and after cytoreductive surgery were classified into two groups: no port site resection (No-PSR) and port site resection (PSR). Based on the pathological results of all port site specimens, PSR was classified as positive port site metastasis (PSM+) and negative port site metastasis (PSM-). Results: In 82 cases, the laparoscopic port site access was resected in the debulking surgery. At the final specimen examination, 49% presented as PSM+. No statistical differences regarding survival were found, either between the No-PSR and PSR groups (p = 0.28) or between the PSM+ and PSM - groups (p = 0.92). A higher wound complication rate was found in the PSR group (17% vs. 34%; p = 0.047). The RR (Relative Risk) of wound events for PSR was 2.42 (95% CI 1.09–5.35; p = 0.0296). Conclusions: To date, not only there is no data supporting PSR after laparoscopy in advanced ovarian cancer, but the role of PSM+ in prognosis also remains unclear. In patients in which laparoscopy is performed prior to the debulking procedure, the PSR may not be recommended in those cases of no macroscopic port site metastasis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,Scopus

The present work aimed to synthesis magnetic NiCo 2 O 4 /NiO nanoparticles by a novel, simple, environmental friendly and cost effective method in the presence of Dactylopius Coccus. The ultra-fine NiCo 2 O 4 /NiO ceramic nanocomposites (NNC) were characterized by X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) as well as vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) used to study the magnetic properties of NNC nanoparticles. MTT cytotoxicity assay performed to determine the anti-proliferative effect of NNC nanoparticles against 4T1 breast cancer cell lines. The results demonstrated that the NNC nanoparticles meaningfully reduced the survival percentage of the 4T1 cells of the murine invasive breast cancer with an IC 50 was of 4 mg/ml. The dominant mechanism of cell death was apoptosis, along with an increase in cellular oxidative stress.

The aim of the present study was to develop a noninvasive, patient-convenient formulation for the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics to cancer cells located in the deep lung tissue. A PEGylated paramagnetic hollow-nanosphere was fabricated, fully characterized and used as a nanocarrier for pulmonary co-delivery of Doxorubicin (DOX) and Methotrexate (MTX). In first step, magnetic-silica nanoparticles were synthesized and then coated with amino/acrylate groups and derivatized with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Finally, silica was removed to provide hollow structured nanoparticles. The biocompatibility of blank carriers and the efficiency of MTX-DOX-loaded carriers were also approved by MTT assay and DAPI staining. The aerosolization performance of nanoparticles embedded microspheres were assessed by next generation impactor. The almost natural zeta potential and obvious decrease in silica content observed by EDX and removal of intense silica characteristic peak at FTIR analyses approved the successful removal of silica layer and preparation of hollow-nanospheres. The successful PEGylation of multilayer magnetic hollow-nanospheres catalyzed by boric acid was confirmed by presence of amide groups in FTIR spectra. The developed polymeric nanoparticle showed quite appropriate loading capacity for both DOX and MTX (48%) because of designing adequate negatively and positively charged sites for both drugs. The cytotoxicity assays proved the safety of blank nanoparticles and efficacy of drugs-loaded nanoparticles on lung cancer A549 cell lines. The developed dry powder inhalation formulation of nanoparticles showed appropriate aerosolization performance (fine particle fraction around 22%).

TNBC is associated with a hypoxic phenotype, and hypoxia contributes to the chemoresistance in breast cancer. Transfer RNA-derived fragments (tDRs) represent a new class of small noncoding RNAs that can be induced specifically by hypoxia. Here, we conducted a comparative analysis of the aberrant expression of tDRs in hypoxia-treated TNBC cell lines through the use of high-throughput sequencing technique. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to validate the differently expressed tDRs between two samples. The results showed that tDR-0009 [derived from transfer RNA (tRNA) Gly-GCC-1-1 ] and tDR-7336 (derived from tRNA Gly-GCC-1–2 ) were significantly upregulated when the SUM-1315 cell lines were stimulated by hypoxia. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis indicated that these two upregulated tDRs were mainly involved in maintenance of stem cell population and cellular response to interleukin (IL)-6, which may be the underlying mechanism of hypoxia-induced tDRs that facilitate the doxorubicin resistance in TNBC. The protein–protein interaction network for predicted target genes established by the STRING database manifested that tDR-0009 (tDR-7336) might be involved in the chemoresistance of TNBC via regulation of the activation of phosphorylation of STAT3. In summary, our study provided a comprehensive analysis of the deviant expression profiling of tDRs in hypoxia-treated TNBC cell lines. Specific tDRs may be a new class of regulatory factors involved in the hypoxia-induced chemoresistance in TNBC, and they could serve as potential biomarkers and intervention targets. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","chemoresistance; hypoxia; tDRs; TNBC",Article,Scopus

Interestingly, the CPT release rate of PPC meshes was significantly higher than that of CPT-loaded PLGA (PLGA-CPT) meshes. Most importantly, incorporation of PF127 in the meshes led to significant reduction in the CT-26 viability compared to PLGA-CPT mesh. The improved anticancer effects of PPC meshes were mainly due to the induction of apoptosis in CT-26 cells.

The results concluded that both individual structures of 7 and 12 were vital for modulating pharmacological potencies and presence of different electron withdrawing and electron donating functional group(s) on the phenylsulfonyl entity yielded varied biological effects. Substituent h (OCF 3 ) and j, k (OCH 3 ) were found to play a crucial role scavenging DPPH [rad] and ABTS [rad]+ as well as inhibiting cancer cell lines SK-OV-3 and HT-29. Moreover, molecules bearing halogen atom(s) such as substituent b-g expressed excellent inhibitory potential against HeLa and A-549 cancerous cell lines. Bioassay data displayed some interesting structure-activity relationships which are discussed in this paper. The results justified that tested derivatives are promising antioxidants and cytotoxic agents and warrant further structural optimization and bioassay studies. Spectroscopic techniques such as FT-IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and elemental analysis (CHN) were carried out to confirm the final structures. © 2019","Antioxidant; Antiproliferative; Chromenones; Free radicals; Homoisoflavonoids; Sulfonylpiperazines",Article,Scopus

The obtained NPs have the hydrodynamic diameter of 281.1 ± 11.1 nm and zeta potential of −33.3 ± 2.5 mV. The data demonstrated that encapsulation of curcumin in HSA NPs by desolvation method has increased water solubility by 400 folds.

Cytotoxicity experiments demonstrated no significant difference between cytotoxic effect of free curcumin and non-targeted HSA/CCM NPs in both HER2 positive and HER2 negative cell lines. However, the toxicity of Apt-HSA/CCM NPs was significantly higher and cell viability reached 36% after 72 h in SK-BR3 cell line.

Case report: We present a case of SCC of the dorsum of the tongue along with the development of two other primary cancers with different histologies in a 61-year-old Japanese woman, who presented with a mass on the dorsum of her tongue in 2017. Intraoral examination revealed a 2.5 × 1.5-cm tumor on the dorsum of the tongue without induration and covered with normal epithelium. She was previously diagnosed with carcinoma in an adenoma of the duodenum in 2013 and adenocarcinoma of the right lung in 2016. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed no evidence of malignant tumors in the head and neck region. The lesion of the tongue was surgically excised with a safe margin. Histological examination revealed well-differentiated SCCs that were completely excised. Discussion: This is a rare case of three primary cancers with different histologies in one patient. Clinicians should consider SCC of the dorsum of the tongue during diagnosis, since it is a rare region and the tumor may mimic benign tumors. © 2019 The Authors","Adenocarcinoma of the lung; Carcinoma in adenoma of the duodenum; Dorsum of the tongue; Squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue; Triple carcinoma",Article,Scopus

At the advent of the genomic era, various genetic mutations in cell signalling pathways have been incriminated in carcinogenesis. Genomic analysis studies have connected main components of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway to BTC. PI3K pathway playing a central role in cell signalling and being deregulated in various tumours has been studied as a target for chemotherapy. Novel compounds have also been identified in preclinical trials that specifically target the PI3K pathway in BTCs, but these studies have not accelerated to clinical use. These novel compounds can be examined in upcoming studies to validate them as potential therapeutic agents, as further research is required to combat the growing need for adjuvant chemotherapy to successfully battle this tumour type. Furthermore, these molecules could also be used along with gemcitabine, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil to improve sensitivity of the tumour tissue to chemotherapy. This review focuses on the basics of PI3K signalling, genetic alterations of this pathway in BTCs and current advancement in targeting this pathway in BTCs. It emphasizes the need for gene-based drug screening in BTC. It may reveal various novel targets and drugs for amelioration of survival in patients with BTC and serve as a stepping stone for further research. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adjuvant therapy; biliary tract cancer; mutation; PI3K; target",Review,Scopus

Methods: CASC2 expression in tumor tissues and HCC cells was tested by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. After manipulating the expression of CASC2 in Hep3B and HepG2 cells, cells viability, including proliferation, apoptosis, cell-cycle distribution, migration, and invasion were examined by colony formation assay, flow cytometry, wound-healing assay, and transwell assay, respectively. The expression levels of proteins associated with the cell cycle and AKT/mTOR pathway were measured by the western blot. Stably transfected HepG2 cells were used to construct nude mice models, and tumorigenesis was evaluated to investigate the in vivo functions of CASC2 in HCC progression. Results: In tissues and cells of HCC, decreased CASC2 expressions were confirmed. Overexpression of CASC2 made cell cycle stagnated at G0/G1 phase and induced apoptosis. Meanwhile, the overexpression of CASC2 played significant roles in inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells. Furthermore, In vivo experiment indicated that CASC2 restrained the growth of tumors. Conclusion: Our study suggested that CASC2 promoted cell apoptosis and suppressed cell growth and metastasis in HCC, indicating that CASC2 might be a useful biomarker of HCC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cancer susceptibility candidate 2 (CASC2); hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); metastasis; proliferation",Article,Scopus

The thermal destruction of SiH 4 occurs within the whole pore volume uniformly because in the thermal chemical vapor deposition method we developed, the limiting stage of the process in which MSP pores are filled with silicon is the reaction in which monosilane is decomposed, rather than its diffusion within template mesopores. The porosity of the mSi particles synthesized can be varied without changes in the shape and outer diameter of the particles by varying the parameters of the technological process of silane decomposition. The particles have large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area (250–350 m 2 g −1 ) and pore volume (0.3–0.5 cm 3 g −1 ). For the first time the obtained submicron spherical porous silicon particles are monodisperse with a size scatter not exceeding 10%, which provides the identity of their hydrodynamic and adsorption properties so important for biomedical applications. We introduced the cytostatic drug doxorubicin (DOX) into mSi pores by the physical adsorption method. It was shown that DOX is desorbed from the mSi pores and penetrates into K-562 cancer cells, with local DOX concentration maxima observed in the intracellular space. The cytotoxicity of the mSi and mSi/DOX particles was studied, and the inhibition capacities of the cancer-cell proliferation by doxorubicin adsorbed by mSi particles and a DOX solution were compared in vitro. It was shown that the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) is four times lower under the action of DOX-loaded mSi particles as compared with free doxorubicin. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Doxorubicin; Hard template synthesis; Inhibition of cancer cell proliferation; Monodisperse micro-mesoporous Si particles",Article,Scopus

The purpose of this study is to define dose–volume predictors for late gastrointestinal and genitourinary (GI and GU) toxicities after HRT in the multi-center NRG Oncology/RTOG 0415 low-risk prostate cancer trial (N = 521). Material/methods: Treatment in the studied HRT arm was delivered as 70 Gy at 2.5 Gy/fraction with 3D-CRT/IMRT (N = 108/413). At a median follow-up of 5.9 years, the crude late ≥Grade 2 GI and GU toxicities were 19% and 29%, respectively. For modeling, the complete HRT cohort was randomly split into training and validation (70% and 30%; preserved toxicity rates). Within training, dose–response modeling was based on dose–volume cut-points (EQD2Gy; bladder/rectum: α/β = 6 Gy/3Gy), age, acute ≥Grade 2 toxicity, and treatment technique using univariate and multivariate logistic regression on bootstrapping (UVA and MVA). Candidate predictors were determined at p ≤ 0.05, and the selected MVA models were explored on validation where model generalizability was judged if the area under the receiver-operating curve in validation (AUC validation ) was within AUC training ± SD with p ≤ 0.05, and with an Hosmer–Lemeshow p-value (p HL ) &gt; 0.05. Results: Three candidate predictors were suggested for late GI toxicity: the minimum dose to the hottest 5% rectal volume (D5%[Gy]), the absolute rectal volume &lt;35 Gy, and acute GI toxicity (AUC = 0.59–0.63; p = 0.02–0.04). The two generalizable MVA models, i.e., D5%[Gy] with or without acute GI toxicity (AUC validation = 0.64, 0.65; p = 0.01, 0.03; p HL = 0.45–0.56), suggest that reducing late GI toxicity from 20% to 10% would require reducing D5%[Gy] from ≤65 Gy to ≤62 Gy (logistic function argument: 17+(0.24D5%[Gy])). Acute GU toxicity showed only a trend to predict late GU toxicity (AUC training = 0.57; p = 0.07). Conclusion: Late GI toxicity, following moderate HRT for low-risk prostate cancer, increases with higher doses to small rectal volumes. This work provides quantitative evidence that limiting small rectal dose ‘hotspots’ in clinical practice of such HRT regimens is likely to further reduce the associated rates of GI toxicity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Gastrointestinal; Genitourinary; Hypofractionation; Prostate cancer; Radiotherapy; Toxicity",Article,Scopus

Resection offers the best chance of long-term survival, but a consistent adverse prognostic factor is the presence of microvascular invasion (MVI). In this study, surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS), a high throughput method of analyzing complex samples, was used to explore differentially expressed proteins between HCC and adjacent nontumour liver tissue (ANLT). These findings were correlated with clinical outcomes. Materials and methods: From 2002 to 2011, tumor and ANLT were collected from patients who underwent liver resection and these samples were later prepared for SELDI-TOF MS. Output data were then used to identify proteins capable of discriminating HCC from ANLT. Proteins from the multivariate analysis were then analyzed to determine prognostic factors and the m/z ratios of these proteins were entered into the ExPASy database to infer potential candidates. Results: During the study period, 30 patients had SELDI-TOF MS performed on their HCC and ANLT samples. On multivariate analysis, a panel of four proteins—m/z 5840, m/z 8921, m/z 9961, and m/z 25,872—discriminated HCC from ANLT with an area under the ROC curve of 0.954 (P < 0.001). On prognostic factor assessment, decreased m/z 9961 was significantly associated with the presence of MVI (P = 0.025) and shorter disease-free survival (P = 0.045) in our patients. A potential candidate for this protein was coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor, isoform 3 (CAR 3/7), which helps maintain tight junction integrity. Conclusions: Using SELDI TOF-MS, we identified a panel of four proteins with excellent discriminative capacity between HCC and ANLT. Of these, m/z 9961 was the only protein significantly associated with a known poor prognostic factor (presence of MVI) and survival (shorter disease-free survival). While loss of CAR 3/7 could lead to MVI, further research is warranted to validate the identity of protein m/z 9961. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","HCC; Hepatocellular carcinoma; m/z 9961; Microvascular invasion; Proteomics; SELDI-TOF MS",Article,Scopus

The aim of this research was to highlight the association between DNA methylation of the glutamate receptor genes and their expression pattern in pathogenesis of OSCC. Materials and methods: Genomic DNA was isolated from 83 OSCC paraffin-embedded tissues (mean age: 59.67 ± 16.08) and 80 normal samples (mean age: 50.15 ± 16.69). Promoter methylation status of glutamate receptors including GRM5, GRM2 and GRIA3 genes were carried out by Methylation Specific PCR technique (MSP). We also investigated the mRNA expression levels of these genes in 15 paraffin-embedded patients and healthy samples using real-time PCR techniques. Result: DNA methylation analysis showed statistically significant differences in the cases in comparison with healthy controls. Our data showed that the promoters of GRM2 and GRIA3 were methylated in the cases. For GRM2 (MM: OR = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.02–3.90; p-value =.37; MU: OR = 8.0; 95% CI = 1.37–47.34; p-value =.02) and GRIA3 (MM: OR = 47.19; 95% CI = 4.61–483.0; p-value =.001; MU: OR = 1.45; 95% CI = 0.35–5.89; p-value =.6). However, methylation of GRM5 promoter was not statistically different in the cases and healthy controls, GRM5 (MM: OR = 0.9; 95% CI = 0.14–5.71; p- value = 0.9; MU: OR = 1.83; 95% CI = 0.33–10.09; p-value =.4). In addition, the evaluation of mRNA expression levels of GRM2, GRIA3 and GRM5 were remarkably different in patients and healthy controls (p <.0001). Summarily, the aim of this study was to assess the methylation and expression pattern of GluR genes and the risk of OSCC. We are of the presupposition that methylation and expression statuses of the chosen genes, GRM5, GRM2 and GRIA3 might be significant biomarkers for OSCC. © 2019","Expression; GRIA3; GRM2; GRM5; Methylation; OSCC",Article,Scopus

Among computational approaches considered here particular emphasis is given to the structure-based statistical mechanical model of allostery (SBSMMA), which allows one to study the causality and energetics of allosteric communication. We argue that the reverse allosteric signaling on the basis of SBSMMA can be used for predicting latent allosteric sites and inducing a tunable allosteric response. Per-residue allosteric effects of mutations can also be explored and ‘latent drivers’ expanding the cancer mutational landscape can be predicted using SBSMMA.

In this milieu, understanding the effect of molecular weight of polymer in designing an effective drug delivery system has caught a significant attention. Here, in this study, we have systematically examined the effects of molecular weights of metal-free fully alternating semi-aromatic polyester made up of commercially available tert-butyl glycidyl ether (tBGE) and phthalic anhydride (PA) monomers (poly(tBGE-alt-PA) copolymer) to design an efficient drug delivery system for cancer therapy. The molecular weights of such polyester greatly influenced the encapsulation efficiency, drug loading capacity, in vitro drug release profile and intracellular drug uptake of different nano-drug carriers, which finally determined its drug delivery efficiency. The anti-tumor therapeutic efficacy of all nano-drug carriers was tested on MIA PaCa-2 cells and maximum cytotoxicity was exhibited in case of poly(tBGE-alt-PA)-DOX nanoparticles of Mn = 9.2 kDa with low IC 50 value. These results were further corroborated with colony forming unit data, where maximum inhibition in MIA PaCa-2 cell proliferation was also found in case of low molecular weight DOX nanoparticles. Hence, we proved that poly(tBGE-alt-PA) copolymer of Mn = 9.2 kDa can be used further in the broader applications of drug delivery. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cancer therapeutics; Drug delivery; Metal-free synthesis; Molecular weight; Nanodrug carrier; Semi-aromatic polyester",Article,Scopus

However, the expression and function of MUC1 in human duodenal adenocarcinoma (DAC) has not yet been characterized because of its low frequency. Here, we examined the functional roles of core protein (MUC1-C) in DAC. Materials and methods: Using a human duodenal cancer cell line, HuTu80, proliferation, migration, invasion, ALDH activity was assessed by cell counting kit–8, scratch wound healing, matrigel invasion, and ALDEFUOR assays, respectively. The function of MUC1 protein was evaluated with knockdown using specific siRNA as well as anti-MUC1-C peptide, GO203. MUC1 expression in human DAC was evaluated immunohistochemically in surgically resected tumors. Results: The positive expression of MUC1 in HuTu80 was confirmed by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. In vitro cell growth was inhibited by the addition of 50-100 μM GO203 as well as treatment with siRNA for MUC1-C. Silencing of MUC1-C also significantly reduced migration, invasion, ALDH activity. Local injection of GO-203 (14 mg/kg) significantly suppressed the growth of subcutaneous HuTu80 tumors in nude mice. Immunohistochemically, MUC1 was strongly detected in seven DAC cases, but not in 11 others. The outcome of patients with high MUC1 expression was significantly worse than those without MUC1 expression. Conclusions: These results suggest that MUC1 is functionally associated with the malignant potential of DAC and could be a novel therapeutic target for this rare tumor. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Duodenal cancer; GO203; Immunohistochmistry; Molecular target; Mucin1",Article,Scopus

We conducted a cross-sectional observational study of 1002 Japanese residents. Through a questionnaire, we investigated socioeconomic status, health status, health-care use, and health literacy.

They are abnormally expressed in various cancers, including esophageal squamous cell cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The CaCC component TMEM16A/ANO1 was recently shown to be overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma cells and may serve as a tumorigenic protein. In this study, we determined that matrine is a potent TMEM16A inhibitor that exerts anti-lung adenocarcinoma effects. Patch clamp experiments showed that matrine inhibited TMEM16A current in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC 50 of 27.94 ± 4.78 μM. Molecular simulation and site-directed mutation experiments demonstrated that the matrine-sensitive sites of the TMEM16A channel involve the amino acids Y355, F411, and F415. Results of cell viability and wound healing assays showed that matrine significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of LA795 cells, which exhibit high TMEM16A expression. In contrast, matrine has only weak inhibitory effect on CCD-19Lu and HeLa cells lacking TMEM16A expression. Matrine-induced effects on the proliferation and migration of LA795 cells were abrogated upon shRNA-mediated TMEM16A knockdown in LA795 cells. Finally, in vivo experiments demonstrated that matrine dramatically inhibited the growth of lung adenocarcinoma xenograft tumors in mice but did not affect mouse body weight. Collectively, these data indicate that matrine is an effective and safe TMEM16A inhibitor and that TMEM16A is the target of matrine anti-lung adenocarcinoma activity.

For this, exosomes were isolated from mouse mammalian breast cancer cell line; 4T1, and subjected to miR-155, miR-142, and let-7i by electroporation. Immature DCs were generated from mouse bone marrow in the presence of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). To mature DCs, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TEX, and modified TEX were used. The expression level of miRNAs and their target genes (IL-6, IL-17, IL-1b, TGFβ, SOCS1, KLRK1, IFNγ, and TLR4) was determined. TEX were nanovesicles with spheroid morphology which expressed CD81, CD63, and TSG101, as exosome markers, at protein level. MHCII, CD80, and CD40 as maturation markers were assessed by flow cytometry. Overexpression of miRNAs were confirmed in exosomes and mDCs.

The human breast cancer resistance protein/ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (BCRP/ABCG2), a member of the ATP-binding cassette family, uses ATP hydrolysis to expel xenobiotics and chemotherapeutics from cells. CCN family member 2 (CCN2) is a secreted protein that modulates the biological function of cancer cells, enhanced ABCG2 protein expression and activation in this study via the α6β1 integrin receptor and increased osteosarcoma cell viability. CCN2 treatment downregulated miR-519d expression, which promoted ABCG2 expression. In a mouse xenograft model, knockdown of CCN2 expression increased the therapeutic effect of doxorubicin, which was reversed by ABCG2 overexpression. Our data show that CCN2 increases ABCG2 expression and promotes drug resistance through the α6β1 integrin receptor, whereas CCN2 downregulates miR-519d.

In this big family, there exist more than 10,000 members that is separated into six chief subtypes: isoflavonols, flavonoenes, flavones, flavonols, anthocyanins, and chalcones. The natural compounds, such as fruits, have visible positive effects in regulating of survival involved signaling pathways that performance as the regulator of cell survival, growth, and proliferation. Researchers have established that commonly consumption up flavonoids decreases incidence and development risk of certain cancers, especially leukemia. Flavonoids have been able to induce apoptosis and stimulate cell cycle arrest in cancer cells via different pathways. Similarly, they have antiangiogenesis and antimetastasis capability, which were shown in wide ranges of cancer cells, particularly, leukemia. It seems that flavonoid because of their widespread approval, evident safety and low rate of side effects, have hopeful anticarcinogenic potential for leukemia therapy. Based on the last decade reports, the most important acting mechanisms of these natural compounds in leukemia cells are stimulating of apoptosis pathways by upregulation of caspase 3, 8, 9 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and proapoptotic proteins, particularly Bax activation. As well, they can induce cell cycle arrest in target cells not only via increasing of activated levels of p21 and p53 but also by inhibition of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases. Furthermore, attenuation of neclear factor-κB and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation, suppression of signaling pathway and downregulation of intracellular antiapoptotic proteins are other significant antileukemic function mechanism of flavonoids. Overall, it appears that flavonoids are promising and effective compounds in the field of leukemia therapy. In this review, we tried to accumulate and revise most promising flavonoids and finally declared their major working mechanisms in leukemia cells. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Apoptosis; CDKs and Caspase 3, 8, and 9; Flavonoids; leukemia; NF-kB; p21/53; STAT3; VEGF/HSP27",Review,Scopus

And the signaling pathways underlying the function of GAS5 during the pathogenesis of prostate cancer (PC) were clarified. Materials and methods: Patients with PC were recruited and grouped according to their specific genotypes of rs55829688 and rs145204276. Kaplan–Meier overall survival curves were calculated and compared among different groups. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays were conducted to examine the expression of different factors involved in PC. And computational analyses and luciferase assays were conducted to clarify the regulatory relationships among the above factors. MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide), flow cytometry, and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) assays were used to evaluate cell viability and apoptosis. Results: The expression of GAS5, PDCD4, PTEN, and AKT was decreased gradually in the order of patient Group 1–4, whereas the expression of microRNA-21 (miR-21) and miR-1284 showed an opposite trend. GAS5 was identified to target miR-21 and miR-1284, whereas miR-21 and miR-1284 regulated the expression of PDCD4/PTEN and AKT, respectively. Moreover, the GAS5/miR-21/PDCD4/PTEN and GAS5/miR-1284/AKT signaling pathway was found to be closely related to the tumorigenesis of PC. Conclusions: GAS5 SNPs affected the survival rate and prognosis in patients with PC via regulating the expression of miR-21/miR-1284, which in turn affected the expression of PDCD4, PTEN, and AKT. GAS5 downregulated the expression of miR-21/miR-1284, thus leading to the elevated expression of key regulators of apoptosis. Therefore, the GAS5 SNPs may be used as key indicators for the diagnosis and prognosis prediction of PC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","apoptosis; GAS5; PDCD4; prostate cancer; PTEN; rs145204276; rs55829688",Article,Scopus

Treatment of DLD1 and ovarian cancer A2780 cells with GYY4137 resulted in intracellular acidification in a concentration-dependent manner. We observed increased mRNA and protein expression of both, NCX1 and sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE1) in DLD1-induced tumors from GYY4137-treated mice. NCX1 was coupled with NHE1 in A2780 and DLD1 cells and this complex partially disintegrated after GYY4137 treatment.

Methods: The targeted NSQIP hepatectomy database from 2014 was used to study patients who underwent hepatectomy for diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum. Results: Of the 3064 hepatic resections in the database, 1138 cases were performed for colorectal metastasis. Of these, 1040 were liver-alone surgery and 98 were synchronous liver and colorectal resection. Most (58.7%) patients received neoadjuvant therapy. The rate of neoadjuvant therapy, intraoperative ablation, biliary reconstruction, and the use of minimally invasive technique were similar between the two groups. The overall 30-d mortality in this cohort was low (1.1%). While the mortality rate in the synchronous group was similar to liver-only group (3.1% versus 0.9%, P = 0.077). The rate of liver failure (3.3% versus 4.1%, P = 0.722) and biliary leak (5.3% versus 9.6%, P = 0.084) were similar between the two groups. However, the rate of major complications was higher on multivariable analyses (25.5% versus 12.1%, OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.5-4.1, P < 0.001) for the synchronous group.

The current study aims to elucidate the role of MIAT in cell survival, apoptosis and migration in neuroblastoma and glioblastoma multiforme. To this end, MIAT was silenced by MIAT-specific siRNAs in neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cell lines, and RNA sequencing together with a series of functional assays were performed. The RNA sequencing has revealed that the expression of an outstanding number of genes is altered, including genes involved in cancer-related processes, such as cell growth and survival, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and migration. Furthermore, the functional studies have confirmed the RNA sequencing leads, with our key findings suggesting that MIAT knockdown eliminates long-term survival and migration and increases basal apoptosis in neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cell lines. Taken together with the recent demonstration of the involvement of MIAT in glioblastoma, our observations suggest that MIAT could possess tumour-promoting properties, thereby acting as an oncogene, and has the potential to be used as a reliable biomarker for neuroblastoma and glioblastoma and be employed for prognostic, predictive and, potentially, therapeutic purposes for these cancers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Apoptosis; Glioblastoma; MIAT; Neuroblastoma; Oxidative stress; RNA sequencing",Article,Scopus

Apelin and APJ are distributed in various tissues, including the heart, lung, liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract and even in tumor tissues. Studies show that apelin messenger RNA is widely expressed in gastrointestinal (GI) tissues, including stomach and small intestine, which is closely correlated with GI function. Thus, the apelin/APJ system may exert a broad range of activities in the digestive system. In this paper, we review the role of the apelin/APJ system in the digestive system in physiological conditions, such as gastric acid secretion, control of appetite and food intake, cell proliferation, cholecystokinin secretion and histamine release, gut–brain axis, GI motility, and others. In pathological conditions, the apelin/APJ system plays an important role in the healing process of stress gastric injury, the clinical features and prognosis of patients with gastric cancers, the reduction of inflammatory response to enteritis and pancreatitis, the mediation of liver fibrogenesis, the promotion of liver damage, the inhibition of liver regeneration, the contribution of splanchnic neovascularization in portal hypertension, the treatment of colon cancer, and GI oxidative damage. Overall, the apelin/APJ system plays diversified functions and regulatory roles in digestive physiology and pathology. Further exploration of the relationship between the apelin/APJ system and the digestive system will help to find new and effective drugs for treating and alleviating the pain of digestive diseases. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Apelin/APJ; digestive; diseases; gastrointestinal (GI); tumor",Review,Scopus

Methods and materials: In order to evaluate inter-observer variabilities (IOV) three medical physicists reconstructed the catheter traces of 13 patients. These manual reconstructions were further compared to the automatic reconstruction algorithm integrated into the planning system and one on purpose imprecise manual reconstruction. For intra-observer variabilities (IAV) repeated reconstructions of two physicists were compared for 13 patients. In total 426 catheters were considered. Keeping dwell times, dwell positions, the optimization and the normalization relative points constant the geometrical deviations between the corresponding dwell positions of the reference data set and the investigated reconstructions were evaluated. Also, the effect on the quality indices, such as coverage index (CI), dose non-uniformity ratio (DNR) or conformal index (COIN), and the exposure of the organs at risk were analyzed. Results: Over all patients and all different catheter reconstructions considered for IOV a mean deviation between the corresponding dwell positions of 0.60 ± 0.35 mm was detected. The first observer had a mean deviation of 0.54 ± 0.32 mm, whereas the second observer yielded a mean deviation of 0.58 ± 0.37 mm. The length of the catheter traces varied in the mean by 0.51 ± 0.45 mm. The mean relative deviation of the CI, DNR, COIN, mean heart dose and mean lung dose varied by 0.27 ± 0.31%, 0.0027 ± 0.0025, 0.0036 ± 0.0033, 0.024 ± 0.019%, 0.05 ± 0.11%, respectively. The skin dose (D 0.2ccm ) changed in the maximum 8.52%. On average IAV reached a deviation between the corresponding dwell positions of 0.49 ± 0.30 mm. IOVs and IAVs proved to be significantly different (Wilcoxon's test p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: The study proved that a repeated reconstruction of the catheter traces does not lead to large geometrical deviations or to a significant change in the dose exposure. But the lack of ground truth makes the estimation of the quality of the reconstruction challenging. A precise reconstruction mapping the reality is a necessity for the planned dose delivery. With all considered reconstruction techniques reliable quality indices for the target and the organs at risk could be obtained. © 2019","Breast cancer; Inter-observer variability; Interstitial multi-catheter brachytherapy",Article,Scopus

Initially, NiFe 2 O 4 nanotubes (NiFe 2 O 4 NTs) with charming properties could act as catalytically promoted sensing platform. This NiFe 2 O 4 NTs based platform could trigger an intense ECL emission of DBAE for the reason that NiFe 2 O 4 NTs not only achieved the high loading of Envision-Ab 1 complex but effectively catalyzed the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to yield oxygen. Moreover, the Envision complex, a polymeric material containing enrich horseradish peroxidase (HRP) could further accelerate the H 2 O 2 decomposition to generate superoxide (O 2 [rad] − ) for the enhancement of the ECL emission process of two luminophors. It's noteworthy that hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (h-BN) as the nanolabels, was first illustrated to be capable of immobilizing a large quantity of lucigenin and retaining intense and stable ECL emission of lucigenin in the alkaline condition. Benefiting from the above merits, a new ECL ratiometric sensing mode was established for the sensitive determination of HE4 in a range from 10 fg/mL to 10 ng/mL with the detection limit of 3.3 fg/mL.

We have found that the presence of Gd 3+ and Tb 3+ up to 2.5% at. does not alter significantly the crystallographic structure of such nanoferrites and does not compromise the magnetic properties of doped nanoparticles.

We found that DANCR was significantly upregulated in HCC cell lines in comparison to LO2 cells. Then, we observed that knockdown of DANCR could greatly inhibit Huh7 and HepG2 cell proliferation. In addition, HCC cell apoptosis was increased by silence of DANCR and meanwhile, cell cycle progression was blocked in G1 phase. Apart from these, downregulation of DANCR repressed HCC cell migration and invasion ability obviously.

Result: Sorafenib, in combination with MSCs, strongly inhibited tumor growth in the xenograft model. Furthermore, the combination therapy significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation, decreased tumor angiogenesis, and induced apoptosis and maintained antitumor-associated anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs. Conclusion: This combination therapy strategy could be used as a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of HCC that significantly improves upon the results achieved using sorafenib as monotherapy. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","hepatocellular carcinoma; human placenta; mesenchymal stem cell; sorafenib",Article,Scopus

However, no treatment method promotes the repair of resected bladder tissue. The aim of this study was to examine the healing process of damaged bladder tissue after a transurethral injection of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into the bladder. An injection of magnetic MSCs meant that they accumulated in the damaged area of the bladder. Another aim of this study was to compare the acceleration effect of MSC magnetic delivery on the repair of bladder tissue with that of non-magnetic MSC injection. Methods: Using the transurethral approach to avoid opening the abdomen, electrofulguration was carried out on the anterior wall of the urinary bladder of white Japanese rabbits to mimic tumor resection. An external magnetic field directed at the injured site was then applied using a 1-tesla (T) permanent magnet. Twelve rabbits were divided into three groups. The 1 × 106 of magnetically labeled MSCs were injected into the urinary bladder with or without the magnetic field (MSC M+ and MSC M-groups, respectively), and phosphate-buffered saline was injected as the control. The effects of the injections in the three groups at 14 days were examined using 4.7-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) then macroscopically and histologically. The mRNA expressions of several cytokines in the repair tissues were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: The macroscopic findings showed the area of repair tissue in the MSC M+ group to be larger than that in either the MSC M-group or control group. MRI clearly depicted the macroscopic findings. The histological study showed that repair of the cauterized area with myofibrous tissue was significantly better in the MSC M+ group than that in either the MSC M-group or control group, although there was no significant difference in several mRNA cytokines among the three groups at 14 days after surgery. Conclusions: The magnetic delivery of MSCs shows promise as an effective, minimally invasive method of enhancing tissue regeneration after TURBT. © 2018 The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine","Bone marrow; Cancer; Mesenchymal stem cell; Regeneration; Transurethral resection; Urinary bladder",Article,Scopus

However, up to 60% of patients who underwent curative resection develop recurrence, and the disease progresses rapidly in many patients. Inflammatory factors are known to be prognostic indicators related to poor overall survival (OS) in patients with other gastrointestinal cancers. This retrospective review aimed to assess the prognostic significance of the preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) in patients who underwent curative resection for AVC. Method: We retrospectively reviewed and abstracted data from the medical records of 169 patients who underwent surgical resection for AVC from January 2009 through December 2013. We investigated the association between the preoperative NLR, PLR, and GPS and disease-free survival (DFS) and OS. Results: In multivariable analysis, both high NLR and PLR were not associated with poor DFS but were significantly related to poor OS (NLR: hazard ratio [HR] 1.916, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.181–3.108, p = 0.008; PLR: HR 1.758, 95% CI 1.071–2.886, p = 0.026). GPS was not a significant prognostic factor for either DFS or OS in both univariable and multivariable analyses. Young age was not related to OS but was significantly associated with poor DFS in both univariable and multivariable analyses (HR 0.356, 95% CI 0.163–0.778, p = 0.010).

While efforts are underway to grow Zambia's palliative care system, the most recent situational analysis of palliative care in Zambia, conducted in 2008, revealed substantial gaps in availability. Methods: To provide an updated appraisal of breast and cervical cancer services in Zambia, including palliative care, we conducted a nationwide provincial and tertiary hospital survey. All 9 provincial hospitals and the University Teaching Hospital and Cancer Diseases Hospital in Lusaka Province participated (N = 11). The survey was conducted between August 2014 and January 2015 and administered in-person at each facility. Data regarding the availability of inpatient, outpatient, and community-based palliative care services, palliative medications, and psychosocial supports was obtained at each facility. The reported results are descriptive in nature. Results: Although the need for palliative care services was recognized, many facilities (64%) lack palliative care policies and only 18% offer palliative care in a coordinated program. The majority of services are only available to inpatients and rarely include community-based programs. While all facilities had adequate supplies of acetaminophen, 82% reported unavailability of codeine and 45% reported no access to oral morphine. Conclusions: This assessment confirms the dearth of palliative care services across Zambia. Less than half of its provincial hospitals offer community- or home-based services and only 55% offer opioid analgesics. Immediate and substantial improvements in policy, drug procurement and distribution, and service expansion are needed to ensure high-quality palliative care is available throughout Zambia. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Palliative care; Sub-Saharan Africa; Zambia",Article,Scopus

Purpose of our study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of FSRT in a series of patients with benign intracranial tumors. Methods: 31 patients with benign intracranial lesions treated with FSRT between 2006 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Indications for treatment included post-operative residual tumor growth or symptomatic exacerbation in patients in whom surgery was not indicated. A clinical and radiological outcome evaluation was performed. Univariate analysis was executed to identify predictors for post-treatment neurological function and radiological tumor control. Results: Median age was 62 years (range 22–82). The lesions treated included 20 meningiomas, 2 vestibular schwannomas, 7 pituitary adenomas, 1 craniopharyngioma, 1 jugular-tympanic paraganglioma. Median clinical target volume was 14.59 cm 3 (range 0.43–159.06) and median planning treatment volume was 18.16 cm 3 (range 0.81–217.24). Median total dose was 45 Gy (range 25–54), and median daily fraction 4 Gy (range 1.8–9). At a median follow-up of 78 and 50 months, respectively clinical and neuroradiological, no tumor had larger dimensions, and only one lesion changed in a way other than size determining a concomitant clinical worsening. Other three patients deteriorated without evidence of radiological progression. Conversely, 12 patients improved clinically. No significant predictor for post-treatment neurological function or radiological tumor control was found.

Curcumin intercalated layered double hydroxide nanohybrid is a potential drug delivery system for effective photodynamic therapy in human breast cancer or skin cancer. The synthesis of the hybrid LDH-CR powder implies the dissolution of CR in water or in another organic solvent which is miscible with water. Since the solubility of curcumin in water is very weak, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the solvent employed for its dissolution on the structural and physico-chemical-photoluminescent properties of the resulting hybrid materials. Four powders of curcumin (CR)-containing Mg2.5Al-LDH hybrids (Mg/Al molar ratio of 2.5) were prepared by co-precipitation (P) and reconstruction (R) using two different solvents for the dissolution of curcumin: (i) an alkaline aqueous solution (A), and (ii) ethanol (E). The reconstruction used the calcinated (460 °C for 18 h) form of the parent Mg2.5Al-LDH powder. All the solids were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and FTIR spectroscopy. The FTIR-ATR spectra of the all the powders except the powder prepared via reconstruction in ethanol exhibit LDH characteristics, consistent with the XRD results.

We conducted genetic analysis in a sub-cohort of the HPV infection in men (HIM) study to test the hypothesis that differences in host genes influence HPV persistence in men. Methods: Baseline and longitudinal genital HPV status at the genitals was measured every 6-months using the Linear Array assay amplified HPV L1 gene fragment using the PGMY09/11 L1 consensus primer system. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the customized genome-wide genotyping array, the “TxArray,” were examined using logistic regression in a case-control study design to assess the association with HPV16 persistence/clearance. Results: Of the total of 737,742 autosomal SNPs in the array, 605,885 passed basic quality control and were examined between 40 men (cases) with &gt; 18 months persistent genital HPV 16 infection vs. 151 controls who were HPV 16-positive, but whose infections cleared in &lt; 18 months.

Conclusions: Our results provide a preliminary basis for understanding the biological mechanism of oncogenic HPV 16 pathogenesis at the genitals in men. Some of the genes flanking the top hit SNPs are consistent with previous findings in both HPV related and non-related cancers but further genetic studies in larger cohorts are warranted to confirm these and identify novel major susceptibility genes involved in the pathogenesis of genital HPV persistence in men. © 2018 The Authors","HPV in men; HPV persistence; Immunogenetics",Article,Scopus

Other methods also have interesting features and applications, including bedside ultrasonography, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and dual x-ray absorptiometry. Compelling evidence indicates these methods can be used to accurately and precisely measure skeletal muscle mass, adipose tissue, and edema; diagnose malnutrition-related diseases; and aid in determining prognoses. To apply this technology properly, it is important to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each technique in specific situations of interest. This review introduces concepts and reference studies published in the scientific literature about these techniques and describes important limitations and considerations necessary to incorporate these methods into clinical practice. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Body composition; Clinical outcomes; Cost-effectiveness; Malnutrition; Muscle mass",Review,Scopus

The mean concentration of Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr, Cd, Ni, V, As and Co in the street dust was: 59, 288, 113, 50, 0.5, 57, 36, 7.1 and 7.5 (mg/kg), respectively. The majority of potentially toxic metals were elevated compared to background concentrations, with the exception of Co and V. Mean enrichment factors decreased in the following order: Zn &gt; Pb &gt; Cu &gt; Cd &gt; As &gt; Cr &gt; Ni &gt; Co &gt; V, with a high enrichment value for Zn and Pb. Cadmium had a moderate potential ecological risk compared to other toxic metals. Correlation coefficients and principal component analysis (PCA) identified three principal groups as sources of toxic metals in Abadan street dust. Metals such as Cr, Ni, Co and V were identified to originate from natural parent materials, Zn, Cu and Pb from anthropogenic sources emitted from combustion/vehicular materials and Cd and As from other anthropogenic sources such as the Abadan refinery and petrochemical complex. The sum of 13 PAHs ranged from 400 to 11,766 (μg/kg), with a mean of 2436 (μg/kg). Approximately 68%–79% of ∑PAHs comprised of higher molecular weight PAHs (HMWPAHs 4–6 rings), revealing a combustion origin. Principal component analysis (PCA) for PAHs in Abadan street dust originated mainly from vehicular, petroleum emission and fossil fuel. The toxic equivalency quantities (TEQs) of PAHs in the street dust ranges from 22 to 951 (μg/kg).

This paper considers the regression adjustment estimation of the Sample Average Treatment Effect (SATE) in high-dimensional case, where the multicollinearity problem is often encountered and needs to be properly handled. Many existing regression adjustment methods fail to achieve satisfactory performances. To solve this issue, an Elastic-net adjusted estimator for SATE is proposed under the Rubin causal model of randomized experiments with multicollinearity in high dimensions. The asymptotic properties of the proposed SATE estimator are shown under some regularity conditions, and the asymptotic variance is proved to be not greater than that of the unadjusted estimator. Furthermore, Neyman-type conservative estimators for the asymptotic variance are proposed, which yields tighter confidence intervals than both the unadjusted and the Lasso-based adjusted estimators. Some simulation studies are carried out to show that the Elastic-net adjusted method is better in addressing collinearity problem than the existing methods. The advantages of our proposed method are also shown in analyzing the dataset of HER2 breast cancer patients. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Average Treatment Effect; Causal inference; Elastic-net; High-dimensional data; Randomized experiments; Rubin causal model",Article,Scopus

The occurrence of lipophagy was first discovered in liver tissues. Additionally, abundant evidence indicated that the occurrence of hepatic lipophagy has been implicated in many liver diseases including fatty liver diseases, nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases, liver fibrosis, and liver cirrhosis. However, recent studies suggested that hepatic lipophagy occurs not only in liver tissue but also in other nonliver tissues and cells. Furthermore, the occurrence of lipophagy plays a crucial role in nonliver tissues and some related diseases. For instance, lipophagy relieves insulin resistance in adipose tissue from obesity patient with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, lipophagy has the ability to remit neurodegenerative diseases by reducing activity-dependent neurodegeneration in nervous tissue. Lipophagy decreases muscle lipid accumulation and accordingly improves lipid storage myopathy in muscle tissue. Moreover, lipophagy alleviates the malignancy and metastasis of cancer in clear renal cell carcinoma tissue. Lipophagy is also involved in other processes, such as spermatogenesis, osteoblastogenesis, and mucosal ulceration.

Methods: Methylation status of the four E2BSs in 43 clinical cervical samples with HPV 16 infection was quantitatively detected using pyrosequencing. Meanwhile, Quantivirus® HPV E6/E7 RNA 3.0 assay (bDNA) was used to detect E6/E7 mRNA levels in the corresponding specimens. Results: Our results showed that methylation status of E2BS1, 2 and 4 sites in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and cervical cancer were significantly higher than that of asymptomatic HPV 16 infection and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) (all P &lt;.05). Furthermore, methylation status of HPV 16 E2BS1 and 2 was positively correlated with E6/E7 mRNA levels (r s = 0.529 and 0.512 respectively, P &lt;.01). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to compare the diagnostic performance of E2BSs methylation. When the Youden index was the maximum value, the methylation level of E2BS1 and E2BS2 all demonstrated optimum diagnostic sensitivity of 77.8%, and specificity of 80% and 92%, respectively. Conclusions: The methylation status of E2BS1 and 2 may have utility as diagnostic markers for the severity of cervical lesions in the future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cervical lesion; E2 binding sites; Human papillomavirus; Methylation; Pyrosequencing",Article,Scopus

For immobilizing the protein molecules, a cavity has been embedded in the gate insulator region due to which gate capacitance changes owing to the accumulation of protein molecules which reflects the deviation in threshold voltage. Higher sensitivity (1.542) is achieved for protein at a very low drain bias (0.2 V) in comparison to streptavidin and APTES ((3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane). Moreover, the cavity gap variation (from 8 to 15 nm) and oxide thickness limitation has also been observed for the device as a biosensor.

In this study, we identified the toxic mechanism of ammonium lauryl sulfate (ALS), the most common detergent in consumer products, using alveolar macrophage cells. In preliminary tests, cell viability sharply decreased between 40 and 200 μg/mL, thus we determined doses of 10, 20, and 50 μg/mL for further study. When treated at a 50 μg/mL for 24 h, cell viability was 67.7 ± 3.4% of the control, and autophagosome-like vacuoles and a number of double membranes surrounding damaged mitochondria were observed in the cytosol. Intracellular ROS, the ATP amount, ER volume, acid cell compartments and mitochondrial potential rapidly reduced with dose, whereas the release of LDH and apoptotic bodies dramatically increased. Additionally, multiple cell death pathways were activated following exposure to ALS, and the expression of caveolin-1, p-Acetyl CoA carboxylase, p21, and p-ERK were greatly inhibited. Moreover, the secretion of inflammatory mediators and expression of innate- and adaptive-immune response-related proteins were remarkably reduced. Meanwhile, the secretion of TGF-β was enhanced. Therefore, we conclude that ALS-induced apoptosis may be due to mitochondrial dysfunction triggered by the inhibition of caveolin-1, and that chronic pulmonary exposure to ALS may cause adverse health effects such as cancer and fibrosis by impairing the host's pulmonary immune system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Ammonium lauryl sulfate (ALS); Apoptosis; Caveolin-1; Detergent; Lung; Mitochondria",Article,Scopus

Primary outcomes of studies included were weight gain, appetite stimulation, and/or caloric/nutritional intake increase. The review was completed in accordance with PRISMA standards. Results: A total of 46 articles across 21 different treatment populations met criteria for the review, including 32 randomized controlled trials, 4 prospective cohort studies, 4 retrospective cohort studies, 4 case reports and 2 case series. Of these, 39 demonstrated that CY resulted in significant weight gain in the sample under study. Studies exploring the use of CY in those with malignant/progressive disease states, such as HIV and cancer, showed minimal to no benefit of the medication. Transient mild to moderate sedation was the most commonly reported side effect. Studies included were heterogeneous in terms of methods as well as study patient demographics, characteristics and concurrent medical conditions. Few studies provided objective measures of appetite change. Discussion: CY appears to be a safe, generally well-tolerated medication that has utility in helping facilitate weight gain in patients drawn from a variety of underweight populations. Future prospective randomized controlled studies in low weight patients that include objective measures of appetite and intake are needed to better understand the mechanism by which CY augments weight gain. © 2019","Appetite stimulation; Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder; Cyproheptadine; Eating disorder",Review,Scopus

Several studies indicated that Hsp90s are potential targets for treating diseases, such as cancer or malaria. It has been shown that Hsp90s from different organisms have peculiarities despite their high sequence identity. Therefore, a detailed comparative analysis of several Hsp90 proteins is relevant to the overall understanding of their activity. Accordingly, the goal of this work was to evaluate the interaction of either ADP or ATP with recombinant Hsp90s from different organisms (human α and β isoforms, Plasmodium falciparum, Leishmania braziliensis, yeast and sugarcane) by isothermal titration calorimetry. The measured thermodynamic signatures of those interactions indicated that despite the high identity among all Hsp90s, they have specific thermodynamic characteristics. Specifically, the interactions with ADP are driven by enthalpy but are opposed by entropy, whereas the interaction with ATP is driven by both enthalpy and entropy. Complimentary structural and molecular dynamics studies suggested that specific interactions with ADP that differ from those with ATP may contribute to the observed enthalpies and entropies. Altogether, the data suggest that selective inhibition may be more easily achieved using analogues of the Hsp90-ADP bound state than those of Hsp90-ATP bound state. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Hsp90; ITC; Molecular dynamics; Protein-ligand interaction; STD-NMR",Article,Scopus

Furthermore, the heat generation of the nanocomposites was measured under an alternating magnetic field. The apatite-forming ability in SBF improved as the Fe 3 O 4 content in the nanocomposite was increased. As the Fe 3 O 4 content was increased, the nanocomposite not only rapidly raised the surrounding temperature to approximately 100 °C, but the specific absorption rate also increased. We assumed that the ionic interaction between the Fe 3 O 4 and rGO was enhanced and that Brown relaxation was suppressed as the proportion of rGO in the nanocomposite was increased. Consequently, a high content of Fe 3 O 4 in the nanocomposite was effective for improving both the osteoconductivity and heat generation characteristics for hyperthermia applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Apatite; Heat generation; Hyperthermia treatment; Magnetite; Reduced graphene oxide; Simulated body fluid",Article,Scopus

Therefore, in this study we demonstrated the effects of oxibendazole on the proliferation of porcine trophectoderm (pTr) cells and porcine luminal epithelial (pLE) cells, a well-known in vitro model system of the fetal-maternal interface. Cell proliferation decreased in both pTr and pLE cells in response to oxibendazole, and we determined that this was modulated through intracellular cell signal transduction. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2, P90RSK, and S6 were downregulated by exposure to a 200 nM dose of oxibendazole in both types of cells, while the expression of phosphorylated JNK, AKT, and P70S6K was upregulated. Pre-treatment with a PI3K/AKT inhibitor (Wortmannin), ERK1/2 inhibitor (U0126), and JNK inhibitor (SP600125) induced the signaling interactions of these molecules, and oxibendazole co-treatment with each inhibitor resulted in even greater decreases in cell proliferation. Furthermore, intracellular and mitochondrial calcium ion accumulation was observed, which would mean that calcium ion homeostasis was disrupted, causing damage to the mitochondrial membrane potential. These deteriorated conditions ultimately led to apoptotic cell death.

The NTP assumed that these tumors were due to genotoxic effects and that a linear dose-response relationship was appropriate. It is plausible that, similar to chloroform, hyperplasia and inflammation are required as initial events for tumor development. If true, then a threshold-based model may be more appropriate for 1-bromopropane. To test this hypothesis, a 28-day repeat dose inhalation Big Blue ® Assay was conducted using female transgenic B6C3F1 mice. The target exposure concentrations and the exposure regimen were identical to those used by the NTP. Results demonstrated no elevation in mutant frequency of the cII transgene in lung, colon, or liver. Positive controls produced statistically significant increases in mutant frequencies across all tested tissues. These results demonstrate that 1-bromopropane does not induce cII mutants in lungs, colon, or liver under the testing conditions. These data have important ramifications in the quantitative evaluation of tumor results for this chemical and support a mechanism of action where a threshold for carcinogenicity is plausible. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","1-bromopropane; Carcinogenesis; In vivo; Inhalation; Mutagenesis; Threshold; Vapor degreaser",Article,Scopus

Therefore, this work aims to a better understanding of Bauhinia longifolia to provide a valuable database for its quality control, pharmacological and toxicological studies. For the chemical analysis, a liquid chromatography-high resolution quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer method was applied to evaluate the chemical profile of Bauhinia longifolia ethanolic leaves extracts, allowing for the identification of 75 compounds comprising chemical classes of phenolic acids, proanthocyanidins, and O-glycosides flavonoids. Most polyphenols were identified for the first time in this specie. In addition, six compounds were isolated and fully identified by liquid chromatography hyphenate to solid phase extraction and nuclear magnetic resonance. Herein, myricitrin, juglanin, afzelin, and bauhiniastatin 2 are reported for the first time for Bauhinia longifolia. Bauhiniastatin 2 has been reported to display anticancer properties towards several cancer cell lines.

Discharging arsenic waste into the environment before proper handling is strictly forbidden. In order to treat the arsenic-bearing wastes in a safe way, we used the oxidation alkali leaching to dissolve arsenic in the low-risk state arsenate (AsO 4 3− ) firstly, followed by recycling of the alkali solution after arsenate removal. In this paper, we synthesized high-concentrated ferric oxyhydroxide gels (HFGs) with different supersaturation in a hydrothermal system to adsorb arsenate anions at high alkali without consuming the hydroxyls. The arsenate adsorption onto HFGs followed the pseudo second-order and intra-particle diffusion kinetics and fitted Langmuir isotherms model well. Through characterization of the synthesized HFGs particles by XRD, Raman spectra, SEM and TGA, it was confirmed that the surface hydroxyl sites on the ferric oxyhydroxide reacted with arsenates to form the bidentate surface complexation. In addition, the synthesized HFG at lower supersaturation had lower crystallinity and more surface hydroxyl sites, resulting in higher adsorption capacity for arsenate. Using HFG as the adsorbent, the arsenic (V) concentration in the copper slag alkali leaching solution can be reduced from 2084 mg/L to 71.8 mg/L, which can realize stabilization of the high-concentrated arsenate at high alkali and alkali solution recycling. © 2019","Arsenic adsorption; Copper recycle; High alkalinity; Iron oxyhydroxide gel; Oxidation alkali leaching",Article,Scopus

This report aims to describe the clinical features and the need for surgical excision preceded by embolization in spinal ABC. Method: A retrospective review of the OR list and tumor board records between 2013 and 2016 yielded a total of 4 cases of spinal ABC who were surgically treated at KFSH-D. Their clinical presentations, radiological and pathological features are reviewed along with the surgical intervention utilized and its outcome. Results: Total of 4 cases were identified, all of them were female (100%). The age ranged from 13 to 25 years old (mean age = 17.75). Two cases (50%) were located in the thoracic spine, one (25%) cervical and one (25%) in the lumbar spine. Back pain, unsteady gait, and progressive limb weakness were the most common presenting symptoms. All the cases underwent embolization followed by surgical excision and fixation with a variable degree of improvement postoperatively. Conclusion: Spinal ABC is a benign tumor that can present with a wide variety of non-specific symptoms. Pre-operative embolization can be helpful to reduce bleeding during surgery. Surgical decompression can lead to significant improvement even in case of severe neurological deficit.

In lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, anticancer agents such as cisplatin and doxorubicin dose-dependently increased toxicity, but the effects were significantly suppressed by culturing the cells in low Mg 2+ -containing media. To obtain the maximum effect in cancer chemotherapy, it should be necessary to prevent the reduction of body Mg 2+ content. Anti-EGFR drugs inhibit EGF-induced elevation of transient receptor potential melastatin 6 (TRPM6) Mg 2+ channel in renal tubular epithelial NRK-52E cells. Here, we found that rosiglitazone, an antidiabetic drug, and all- trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), a vitamin A derivative, increase the messenger RNA (mRNA) level of TRPM6 in the presence of erlotinib. The rosiglitazone- and ATRA-induced elevation of mRNA level, Mg 2+ influx, and promoter activity of TRPM6 were inhibited by GW-9662, a potent antagonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ, and LE135, a retinoic acid receptor (RAR) antagonist, respectively. Rosiglitazone increased the phosphorylation and nuclear localization levels of PPARγ, which were inhibited by GW-9662. In contrast, RAR was mainly distributed in the nuclei under control conditions, which was unchanged by ATRA and LE135. The promoter activity of TRPM6 was inhibited by a mutation in the peroxisome proliferator hormone response element (PPRE). A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that PPARγ and RAR bind to the PPRE, which was blocked by GW-9662 and LE135, respectively.

AR silencing sensitizes txr cells to taxol threefold, whereas ectopic AR expression in AR-null HEK293 cells induces resistance to taxol by 1.7-fold. AR activation using the agonist dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or sublethal taxol treatment upregulates ABCB1 expression in both txr cells and AR-expressing HEK293 cells. In contrast, AR inactivation using the antagonist bicalutamide downregulates ABCB1 expression and enhances cytotoxicity to taxol. A functional ABCB1 promoter containing five predicted androgen-response elements (AREs) is cloned. Deletion assays reveal a taxol-responsive promoter segment which harbors ARE4. Notably, DHT- or taxol-activated AR potentiates binding of the AR to ARE4 as revealed by the chromatin immunoprecipitation. On the other hand, txr cells display an increase in chromatin remodeling. AR/H3K9ac and AR/H3K14ac complexes bind specifically to ARE4 in response to taxol. Furthermore, acetyltransferase protein levels (p300 and GCN5) are upregulated in txr cells. Silencing of p300 or GCN5 reduces chromatin modification and enhances cytotoxicity in both parental and txr SKOV3 cells.

Iron-based phases that work in concert with porous grafts provide promising strategies for chemotherapy and bone repair after surgery. However, seldom are studies associated to the involvement of extrinsic iron ions in the essential angiogenesis of implantation. In this work, we fabricated a novel iron-loaded biocomposite scaffold with hierarchical channels toward unraveling the influence of Fe 3+ release on the angiogenic response of bone grafts. Iron-doped octacalcium phosphate (Fe-OCP) as a viable controllable ferric agent was prepared by homogeneous precipitation through hydrolysis of carbamide. The intervention of Fe 3+ altered the crystallochemical properties of OCP with preferential growth of plane (h 0 0) and inhibition growth of plane (0 0 l). Fe-OCP significantly promoted the affinity, viability, proliferation, and angiogenic differentiation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) scaffold with Fe-OCP showed enhanced deposition of bone-like apatites and sustained Fe 3+ release under simulated physiological environment. The scaffold supported endothelial cells adhesion and spreading, and notably enhanced angiogenesis with more blood vessels formation and higher specific markers expression. Results suggest that Fe 3+ can increase HIF-1α levels and VEGF expression, and promote NO secretion and eNOS production, thus mediating endothelial cells behaviors and angiogenesis.

On the other hand, doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective chemotherapeutic agent against BC; unfortunately, its clinical use is limited by dose-dependent side effects. Therefore, extensive efforts have been dedicated to suppressing metastasis of BC and also to overcome DOX side effects together with keeping its antitumor efficacy. Studies supported the role of oleuropein (OLEU) in reducing DOX-induced side effects besides its antitumor actions. In this study, the antimigratory effect of OLEU was assessed and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was used to detect OLEU effect on the expression level of EMT markers, in MCF-7 cells. The cytotoxic effect of OLEU and DOX was assessed by MTT assay, whereas the ratio of apoptosis was investigated by flow cytometry. The results showed that migration ability of MCF-7 cells remarkably decreased in OLEU treated group and RT-PCR results showed that OLEU may exert its antimigratory action by suppressing EMT through downregulation of sirtuin1 (SIRT1). Also, the results indicated that both OLEU and DOX were cytotoxic to MCF-7 cells, whereas DOX-OLEU cotreatment led to additive cytotoxicity and apoptosis rate. This study provides evidence regarding the suppressive role of OLEU on MCF-7 cells migration ability through suppression of EMT, and for the first time, it was proposed that SIRT1 downregulation can be involved in the OLEU antimigratory effect. Also, the findings demonstrated that OLEU can reduce DOX-induced side effects by reducing its effective dose. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","apoptosis; doxorubicin (DOX); E-cadherin (E-CAD); epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); metastasis; oleuropein (OLEU); sirtuin1 (SIRT1)",Article,Scopus

Nevertheless, it is still challenging to create convenient self-assembled multifunctional materials with high solubilization and encapsulation capacities by preserving their advanced capabilities to protect loaded cargos without altering their characteristics. In this work, we present an extended concept of micellar clusters (MCs) formation based on partial entrapment and stabilization of chelate ligands by hydrophobic forces found on the non-ionic surfactant micelle interface of the Triton-X family (TX-100/TX-114), followed by subsequent complexation of the preformed structures either by metal ions or a supporting chelator. The formation aspects, inner structure and the role of external factors such as the addition of competitive ligands have been extensively studied. MCs loaded by hydrophobic fluorescent compounds with high encapsulation efficiency demonstrate an excellent optical response in aqueous media without crystallization as well as sufficient increase in solubility of toxic hydrophobic compounds such as bilirubin (>50 times compared to pure surfactants). Furthermore, Triton-X-based MCs provide a unique feature of selective permeability to hydrophilic ligand-switching proteins such as UnaG and BSA demonstrating bright “turn-on” fluorescence signal either inside the cluster or on its interface via complexation. The proposed strategies allowed us to successfully encapsulate and visualize a newly synthesized, highly hydrophobic anticancer PTR-58-CLB-CAMP peptide drug, while MCs loaded by the drug exhibit a considerable antitumor activity against HeLa cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Anticancer drugs; Encapsulation; Fluorescence enhancement; Micellar clusters; Self-assembly; Surfactants; Triton-X",Article,Scopus

This study focused to deliver an anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drug Ginsenoside Rb1 through chitosan-Alginate nanocomposite film prepared by solution method. Ginsenoside Rb1 is a dammaran saponin group, which is extracted from an herbaceous plant Panax notoginseng. Ginsenoside loaded alginate-chitosan nanocomposite films were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) methods. The FTIR spectra of alginate/chitosan/ginsenoside Rb1 nanocomposite films show that chitosan, alginate, and ginsenoside Rb1 are linked through the hydrogen bonding and dipolar-dipolar interactions. The FESEM image indicates that the chitosan and ginsenoside Rb1 dispersed well in the alginate matrix. The DSC diagrams display that melting temperature of alginate/chitosan/ginsenoside Rb1 nanocomposite films higher than that of chitosan and lower than that of alginate. It means that alginate and chitosan interact together. Investigation of the ginsenoside Rb1 release from alginate/chitosan/ginsenoside Rb1 nanocomposite films at different pH solutions and different ginsenoside Rb1 content has been carried out by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy method. The rate of drug release is proportional to the increase in pH solution and inversely proportional to the content of loaded ginsenoside Rb1. The Rb1 release process includes two stages: burst release in the first 10 hours, then constant release afterwards. The suitable ratio of alginate/chitosan to prepare the alginate/chitosan/ginsenoside Rb1 nanocomposite films for further investigations was found out to be 8:2. Ginsenoside Rb1 release process from alginate/chitosan/ginsenoside Rb1 nanocomposite films was believed to be first-order kinetics in the first stage, and then the Rb1 release complies with Higuchi kinetic model in the slow release stage.

Cell apoptosis was determined using Annexin V-FITC/PI dual staining, cell cycle detected with PI staining, intracellular ROS levels measured with DCFH-DA probe, and apoptosis-related protein expressions determined using Western blotting. Results showed that there was a promotion in apoptosis rate, intracellular ROS levels, the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, protein expression (Cyt c, Caspase-3, p53, Ac-p53 and p21) and blockage of S phase after cells were exposed to NaF.

In this study, a natural antimicrobial cationic peptide of epsilon-poly-L-lysine (EPL) decorated ordered mesoporous silica (SBA-15) was facilely prepared for the efficient loading of antifungal itraconazole (ITZ) drugs. The characterized mesoporous SBA-15/EPL/ITZ composite exhibited remarkable antifungal performance against Aspergillus fumigatus as a model mold, which was attributed to synergistic antifungal activities of ITZ and EPL in the mesopores. Moreover, the in vitro release behaviors of ITZ in the composite nanoexcipients both in simulated gastric fluid and fasted state simulated intestinal fluid were studied. The observed release kinetics of ITZ demonstrated a contributing role of SBA-15/EPL to enhance the solubility of ITZ and thereby may promote its flux across the gastrointestinal epithelium, which is beneficial for the absorption of drugs. Additionally, SBA-15/EPL/ITZ composites showed desirable biocompatibility toward mammalian red blood cells, human cervical cancer cells (Hela) and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T). Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic profiles of obtained nano-formulations were assessed in rats, among which the improved adsorption of SBA-15/EPL/ITZ composites (AUC 0–24h sum : 8381.7 nM·h) was identified compared with that of pure ITZ (525.1 nM·h) and the commercial drug of Sporanox (7516.6 nM·h). Collectively, the prepared SBA-15/EPL/ITZ provides an ecofriendly and integrated nanocomposite with enhanced solubility of lipophilic drugs to combat proliferations of infectious fungi. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Antifungal; Epsilon-poly-L-lysine; Itraconazole; Mesoporous silica; Synergistic effect",Article,Scopus

Methods: From September 2010 to November 2018, 180 patients suffering from VS have been operated on with microsurgical technique via retrosigmoid (RS) approach in our Department. From July 2012 to April 2018, tumor resection was performed in 78 cases with the assistance of 2μ-Thulium-fiber hand-held flexible laser. Facial nerve function was assessed with the House-Brackmann (HB) scale preoperatively, 1 week postoperatively, and 6-month after surgery. Results: Overall time from incision to skin suture changed in relation to size of tumor (185–575 min) and was not affected by the use of laser. In 5 out of 78 cases preoperative facial nerve palsy HB2 and in one case HB4 (permanent) was observed. On considering 77 cases (excluding 1 permanent HB4) with a minimum 6-month follow-up, facial nerve preservation rate (HB1) was 92,2%. Hearing preservation rate (AAO-HNS A/B classes) was possible in 17 out of 30 cases (56,7%). Adopting a 0–3-scale, the mean surgeon satisfaction rate of usefulness of laser fiber was 2,75. Conclusions: The use of 2μ-Thulium-fiber hand-held flexible laser in VS-microsurgery seems to be safe and to facilitate tumor resection, especially in “difficult” conditions (e.g., highly vascularized and hard tumors). In this retrospective trial, the good functional outcome following conventional microsurgery had not further improved, nor the surgical time reduced by laser. Focusing its use on “difficult” (large and vascularized) cases may lead to different results in future. © 2019","2μ-Thulium laser; Acoustic neuroma; Facial nerve preservation; Hearing preservation; Retrosigmoid approach; Vestibular schwannoma",Article,Scopus

The current study aimed to investigate the role of lncRNA solute carrier family 8 member A1 antisense RNA 1 (SLC8A1-AS1) in myocardial damage by targeting solute carrier family 8 member A1 (SLC8A1) via cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate-protein kinase G (cGMP-PKG) signaling pathway in AMI mouse models. Differentially expressed lncRNA in AMI were initially screened and target relationship between lncRNA SLC8A1-AS1 and SLC8A1 was then verified. Infarct size, levels of inflammatory factors, biochemical indicators, and the positive expression of the SLC8A1 protein in AMI were subsequently determined. The expression of SLC8A1-AS1, SLC8A1, PKG1, PKG2, atrial natriuretic peptide, and brain natriuretic peptide was detected to assess the effect of SLC8A1-AS1 on SLC8A1 and cGMP-PKG. The respective contents of superoxide dismutase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were detected accordingly. Microarray data GSE66360 provided evidence indicating that SLC8A1-AS1 was poorly expressed in AMI. SLC8A1 was verified to be a target gene of lncRNA SLC8A1-AS1. SLC8A1-AS1 upregulation decreased levels of left ventricular end-systolic diameter, −dp/ dt max , interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, transforming growth factor α, nitric oxide, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, infarct size, LDH activity and MDA content, and increased IL-10, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and + dp/ dt max . Furthermore, the overexpression of SLC8A1-AS1 was noted to elicit an inhibitory effect on the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway via SLC8A1. In conclusion, lncRNA SLC8A1-AS1, by downregulating SLC8A1 and activating the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, was observed to alleviate myocardial damage, inhibit the release of proinflammatory factors and reduce infarct size, ultimately protecting against myocardial damage. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cGMP-PKG signaling pathway; long noncoding RNA SLC8A1-AS1; myocardial damage; myocardial infarction; SLC8A1",Article,Scopus

We sought to assess ongoing trends in pediatric surgical research by analyzing the scientific content of each association's yearly meeting. Methods: Abstracts presented at AAP and APSA between 2009 and 2013 were identified from the final printed programs (n = 910). Video abstracts (n = 34) were excluded. Collected data included title, authors, classification (basic science/clinical), presentation type (podium/poster), and topic. Publication as a journal article was determined using the abstract title/authors in a PubMed search. Journal impact factors were recorded for each journal and a composite impact factor (CIF) was calculated by dividing the sum of impact factors by the published articles per meeting. Results: Number of abstracts presented, percentage published, abstract classifications, and presentation type remained consistent over the study period. The AAP meetings accepted a higher percentage of clinical abstracts: AAP 72.3 ± 3.4% versus APSA 65.9 ± 1.3%. The five most popular topics at both meetings were oncology, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, necrotizing enterocolitis, trauma, and appendicitis. The publication rate for clinical and basic science abstracts did not vary significantly over the study period, whereas CIFs were higher for basic science publications nearly every year. The percentage of podium abstracts published was significantly greater than poster abstracts, but no statistical difference in CIF was seen between podium- and poster-associated publications. Conclusions: Abstracts accepted and presented at the two major pediatric surgical specialty meetings more commonly involve clinical studies with a trend away from basic science. Despite this, basic science abstracts tended to be published in higher impact journals. This study attempts to quantify the quality of pediatric surgical research and serves as a baseline for future comparison. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Abstracts; Impact factor; National meeting; Pediatric surgery; Publication",Conference Paper,Scopus

Biological synthesis of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) has known to possess suitable alternatives than the existing chemical methods. Greener synthesis of MNPs by using plant extracts has become an emerging field due to their safe, eco-friendly and non-toxic nature that are suitable for synergistic biological activities. Hence, the greener method is chosen by the present study. In the present study, the greener synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was successfully done by using Coleus aromaticus leaf extract at three different temperatures (30 °C, 60 °C and 100 °C). The formation of AuNPs was initially monitored by visual observation and then characterized with the help of diverse techniques like UV–Vis spectroscopy (UV–Vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), High Resolution-Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak and crystalline nature of AuNPs were obtained by UV–Vis and XRD spectroscopies respectively. FT-IR analysis shows the different characteristic functional groups in turn responsible for the bio-reduction of gold ions by using leaf extract. The formations of different nano-sized AuNPs with their different morphologies were observed by SEM and HR-TEM analyses. Surface charge and stability of the AuNPs were measured by zeta potential and DLS respectively. The synthesized AuNPs coated with cotton fabric was analyzed by UV-Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (UV-DRS), which revealed excellent UV protection against UV radiation. The AuNPs coated cotton fabric exhibited remarkable antibacterial sensitivity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. Further, the synthesized AuNPs showed significant cytotoxicity against human liver cancer (HepG2) cell line. The findings of this study revealed that, AuNPs synthesized using Coleus aromaticus leaf extract could be an alternative, safe, and effective source of UV protection, antibacterial and anticancer agents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Antibacterial activity; Au nanoparticles; Coleus aromaticus; Cytotoxicity; UV protection",Article,Scopus

In this process, the segmentation of regions of interest of these diseases has a fundamental role in their subsequent classification. With skin lesions segmentation it is no different and in recent years many studies have achieved interesting results, becoming an important tool in aiding the medical diagnosis of skin diseases. In this work, a morphological geodesic active contour segmentation (MGAC) method is proposed with automatic initialization, using mathematical morphology which is a great partial differential equation approximation, with lower computational cost, no stability problems and fully automatic. The proposed method was tested in a stable and well-known dermoscopic images database provided by Pedro Hispano Hospital (PH2) and was compared with both methods that make use of machine learning or deep learning techniques such as fully convolutional networks (FCN), full resolution convolutional networks (FrCN), deep class-specific learning with probability based step-wise integration (DCL-PSI), and others, and also traditional methods like JSEG, statistical region merging (SRM), Level Set, ASLM and others. The MGAC showed good results in all similarity metrics compared in this work like Jaccard Index (86.16%), Dice coefficient (92.09%) and Matthew correlation coefficient (87.52%), and also achieves good results in sensitivity (91.72%), specificity (97.99%), accuracy (94.59%) and F-measure (93.82%). Thus, the proposed method presented better results in relation to all these metrics when compared to the traditional methods and still presented better results in relation to the methods that use machine learning or deep learning techniques in Jaccard Index, Dice coefficient and specificity. This confirm that the MGAC can efficiently segment skin lesions, presenting great potential to be applied in the aid of the medical diagnosis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Automatic segmentation; Dermoscopic image; Geodesic active contour; Skin lesion segmentation",Article,Scopus

Particular soil bacteria and fungi can degrade GBHs, hence, search for new GBH-degrading strains or microbial consortia, effective under specific growth conditions and local environment, seems to be a promising solution for bio-remediation of glyphosate-contaminated environment. Consequently, there is a need for rapid and informative methods to evaluate the GBH-induced changes of the metabolic pathways in cells, that may serve as indicators of GBH-degrading potential. Three new GBH-degrading bacterial strains, Pseudomonas sp., Actinobacteria and Serratia sp. were isolated from sludge of municipal waste water treatment plant (Daugavgriva, Riga, Latvia), agricultural soil and plant tissue, respectively. This study examined the response of these isolates to elevated concentrations of glyphosate (GLP) (100 and 500 mg/L) in GBH Klinik® 360 SL. The GBH-induced shift of metabolic activity in cells of Pseudomonas sp. was shown by tests on EcoPlates™. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analyses were used to evaluate the metabolomic response of bacteria to elevated concentrations of GBH in the growth environment. The spectra of Pseudomonas sp. and Serratia sp., incubated with and without GBH, were similar, thus indicating their GBH-resistance. The absorption at 1736 cm −1 , assigned to ester carbonyl stretch vibrations, was detected in spectra of all three bacteria. The highest ester content was detected in Actinobacteria grown in medium with 1.0% molasses and 100 or 500 mg/L GLP in GBH Klinik®. An increase of cellular amounts of esters, either those of phospholipids or poly-β-hydroxybutyrates, indicates degradation of GLP. Therefore, monitoring the ester carbonyl stretch vibration band in FTIR spectra of bacterial biomass may speed up the search GBH-degrading strains. Microbiological tests and cell metabolic response studies by FTIR spectroscopy showed that the three new isolates of Pseudomonas sp., Actinobacteria and Serratia sp. were resistant to elevated concentrations of GBH Klinik® in growth environment and exhibited the potential for GBH degradation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Actinobacteria and Serratia sp.; FTIR spectroscopy; Glyphosate; Glyphosate-degrading bacteria; Klinik® 360 SL; Pseudomonas sp.",Article,Scopus

In addition, combined administration of Amlexanox with Docetaxel reduced mammary tumour growth of syngeneic 4T1 cells, inhibited metastases and improved survival in mice after removal of the primary tumour. Functional and mechanistic studies in breast cancer cells, osteoclasts and osteoblasts revealed that IKKε inhibition reduces the ability of breast cancer cells to grow, move and enhance osteoclastogenesis by engaging both IRF and NFκB signalling pathways.

In humans, there are 39 HOX genes found in four clusters that are located on different chromosomes. The HOX clusters also contain numerous non-protein-coding RNAs, including some lncRNAs. The HOX cluster-embedded lncRNAs (HOX-lncRNAs), most notably, HOTTIP and HOTAIR play a major role in the regulation of their adjacent coding genes. Recently, most HOX-lncRNAs have been shown to impact tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Several HOX-lncRNAs, including HOTTIP, HOXA11-AS, HOTAIRM1, HOXA-AS3, HOXA10-AS, HOTAIR, and HAGLR, are dysregulated in lung cancer.

LncRNA FGF13-AS1 has been identified as one of the 25 downregulated lncRNAs in breast cancer through analyzing data from two cohorts and TCGA by another group of our lab. In this study, we report that FGF13-AS1 expression is decreased in breast cancer tissue compared with corresponding normal tissue, and the downregulation of FGF13-AS1 is associated with poor prognosis. Functional studies show that FGF13-AS1 inhibits breast cancer cells proliferation, migration, and invasion by impairing glycolysis and stemness properties. Mechanistically, FGF13-AS1 reduces the half-life of c-Myc (Myc) mRNA by binding RNA-binding proteins, insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding proteins (IGF2BPs) and disrupting the interaction between IGF2BPs and Myc mRNA. Furthermore, Myc transcriptionally inhibits FGF13-AS1, forming a feedback loop in this signaling pathway. These results reveal for the first time that FGF13-AS1 functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting glycolysis and stemness properties of breast cancer cells, and the FGF13-AS1/IGF2BPs/Myc feedback loop could be a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer patients. © 2019","c-Myc; Lnc FGF13-AS1; Metabolism; Stemness",Article,Scopus

Intratumoral hypoxia, i.e. reduced oxygen supply following uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells, is thought to support TIC activity by inducing specific hypoxia-responsive mechanisms that are not yet entirely understood. Using previously established and fully characterized patient-derived TIC cultures, we could observe increased sphere and colony formation under hypoxic conditions. Mechanistically, microRNA (miRNA)-profiling experiments allowed us to identify miR-215 as one of the main hypoxia-induced miRNAs in primary colon TICs. Through stable overexpression of miR-215, followed by a set of functional in vitro and in vivo investigations, miR-215 was pinpointed as a negative feedback regulator, working against the TIC-promoting effects of hypoxia. Furthermore, we could single out LGR5, a bona fide marker of non-neoplastic intestinal stem cells, as a downstream target of hypoxia/miR-215 signaling.

Full-length HPV-immortalized HSIL cells demonstrated higher TET1/5hmC levels, and stemness properties, compared to invasive cancer cells. TET1 silencing promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), to transform precancerous cells in vivo. TET1 increased 5hmC in the ZEB1 and VIM promoters, surprisingly, silencing both genes.

Accumulating evidence demonstrates that anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies might potently enhance antitumor effects in various tumors, but the effect of PD-L1 on colorectal cancer stem cells (CSCs) remains unclear. We observed high PD-L1 expression in CD133 + CD44 + colorectal CSCs and CSC-enriched tumorspheres. Altering PD-L1 expression promoted colorectal CSC self-renewal by increasing the expression of stemness genes, the CD133 + CD44 + cell population sizes and the ability to form tumorspheres. Additionally, PD-L1 expression was markedly increased in chemoresistant colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, PD-L1 enhanced CRC cell tumorigenicity in nude mice; the inoculation of 1 × 10 4 cells resulted in high tumor formation efficiency. Mechanistically, PD-L1 directly interacted with HMGA1, and HMGA1 upregulation by PD-L1 activated HMGA1-dependent pathways, including the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways, and promoted CSC expansion. HMGA1 downregulation rescued the PD-L1-induced phenotypes, highlighting the role of HMGA1 in PD-L1-mediated colorectal CSC self-renewal. Moreover, PD-L1 expression was correlated with the expression of CSC markers and HMGA1 in clinical CRC specimens.

ROS are the primary effector molecules of radiation, and increase of ROS production by pharmacological modulation is known to enhance radioresponse. We therefore investigated the radiosensitizing effect of PL in colorectal cancer cells (CT26 and DLD-1) and CT26 tumor-bearing mice. Firstly, we found that PL induced excessive production of ROS due to depletion of glutathione and inhibition of thioredoxin reductase. Secondly, PL enhanced both the intrinsic and hypoxic radiosensitivity of tumor cells, linked to ROS-mediated increase of DNA damage, G2/M cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of cellular respiration. Finally, the radiosensitizing effect of PL was verified in vivo. PL improved the tumor response to both single and fractionated radiation, resulting in a significant increase of survival rate of tumor-bearing mice, while it was ineffective on its own. In line with in vitro findings, enhanced radioresponse is associated with inhibition of antioxidant systems.

Here we reported that STAT3 inhibition significantly enhanced the intensity and duration of STING signaling induced by the STING agonist c-diAM(PS) 2 . Such sensitization effect of STAT3 inhibition on STING signaling depended on STING rather than cGAS, which was mediated by simultaneously upregulating the positive modulators and downregulating the negative modulators of the STING pathway.

However, few investigations associated with the biological behavior of MTDH in CRC have been performed. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of modification of MTDH gene expression (knockdown and overexpression) on the biological behavior of CRC in vitro. Methods: MTDH gene expression was analyzed in two CRC cell lines (Caco-2 and HCT116) by qPCR. MTDH was down-regulated via siRNA-mediated knockdown of human MTDH in HCT116 cells, which express high endogenous levels of MTDH gene. Also, MTDH gene was up-regulated via transfection of Caco-2 cells, which express low endogenous levels of MTDH gene, with a plasmid carrying human MTDH gene. Results: Knockdown of MTDH gene expression significantly decreased the gene expression of multidrug resistance gene (MDR1), Snail and NF-κB p65, but increased the gene expression of E-cadherin. Furthermore, MTDH-knockdown significantly decreased anaerobic glycolysis (glucose consumption and lactate production), cell proliferation ability and transformation into cancer stem cell. Moreover, up-regulation of MTDH gene significantly increased the gene expression of MDR1, Snail and NF-κB p65, deceased the gene expression of E-cadherin, enhanced cell proliferation, and anaerobic glycolysis and activated transformation into cancer stem cells. Conclusions: MTDH has an important role in promoting CRC aggravation. Also, inhibition of MTDH expression may attenuate the carcinogenic behavior of CRC cells. Furthermore, MTDH-associated NF-κB p65 signaling pathways may be involved in mediating the biological behavior of CRC. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Colorectal cancer stem cells; E-cadherin; MDR1; MTDH; NF-ĸB p65; Snail",Article,Scopus

MMPs have been explained with regards to extracellular matrix remodeling, which occurs throughout life and ranges from tissue morphogenesis to wound healing in various processes. MMP are inhibited by endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Matrix metalloproteases act as an interface between host's attack by Tat protein of HIV-1 virus and extracellular matrix, which causes breaches in the endothelial barriers by degrading ECM. This process initiates the dissemination of virus in tissues which can lead to an increase HIV-1 infection. MMPs are diverse and are highly polymorphic in nature, hence associated with many diseases. The main objective of this review is to study the gene expression of MMPs in HIV-related diseases and whether TIMPs and MMPs could be related with disease progression, HIV vulnerability and HAND. In this review, a brief description on the classification, regulation of MMP and TIMP, the effect of different MMPs and TIMPs gene polymorphisms and its expression on HIV-associated diseases have been provided. Previous studies have shown that MMPs polymorphism (MMP-1, MMP-2 MMP3, and MMP9) plays an important role in HIV vulnerability, disease progression and HAND. Further research is required to explore their role in pathogenesis and therapeutic perspective. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Genetic polymorphism; HAND; HIV disease progression; MMP; TIMP",Review,Scopus

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the development of HCC remain unknown. To identify the candidate genes in the progression of HCC, gene expression profiles GSE14520, GSE54236, GSE57957 and GSE64041 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO). A total of 405 tumor and 399 para-carcinoma samples from patients with HCC were examined to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by function enrichment analyses including Gene Ontology (GO) functions and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. A total of 78 DEGs were screened, including 62 downregulated genes and 16 upregulated genes. Subsequently, the protein-protein interaction network (PPI) was constructed using the Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database. The module analysis and Hub genes validation were performed using Cytoscape software. Hierarchical clustering of hub genes was evaluated using UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser. Survival analyses of Hub genes were performed using Kaplan Meier Plotter database. Genes specifically expressed in the liver were analyzed using GENEVESTIGATOR database. CYP2C8 was identified as one of the most promising molecules among all the candidate genes. The expression profile of CYP2C8 in HCC was analyzed using ONCOMINE and UALCAN database. The expression levels of CYP2C8 in HCC samples and hepatoma cells were verified using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry analysis. In summary, DEGs and hub genes were identified in the present study, which provides novel insight on the development of HCC.

The formation of sIPN within a core stabilizes the micelle upon temperature and concentration changes. We determined optimized methods for the preparation of F127 sIPN in the regime of chemical components. Importantly, F127 sIPNs are able to load various organic fluorescence probes, covering a panchromatic range of photoluminescence (350–850 nm; entire UV–Vis-NIR), without compromising their photophysical properties. Moreover, efficient cellular uptake of the fluorescence probes loaded sIPN is observed in human and mouse cells. After intravenous injection into mice, an infrared dye-loaded sIPNs are incorporated in multiple organs and have longer lifetime than a commercially available imaging probe.

The results revealed that the expression of tripartite motif-containing 59 (TRIM59) was significantly increased in the CCA tissue samples. TRIM59 is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, which contains a highly conserved N-terminal—an interesting new gene (RING) domain regulating transcriptional factors and tumorigenesis. In the present study, we investigated the effects of TRIM59 expression on tumour growth in CCA. Materials and methods: After analyzing the microarray datasets from the TCGA database and GEO DataSets, we screened out 291 target genes, which are significantly overexpressed in CCA tissues, and TRIM59 was one of them. The quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were performed to determine the expression of TRIM59 in CCA tissues (n = 65) and cell lines. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was conducted to assess the prognosis of TRIM59 in patients with CCA. A specific siRNA (siRNA-1008) was used to inhibit the expression of TRIM59 in HCCC9810 and HUCCT1 cell lines. The effects of TRIM59 silencing on cell proliferation were assessed by the CCK-8, colony-formation, and EDU incorporation assays. Furthermore, the effects of TRIM59 knockdown on cell apoptosis and cell cycle were determined by flow cytometry. The in vivo effects were evaluated using a mouse tumorigenic model. Western blotting was also performed to verify the relationship between knockdown of TRIM59 and activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Results: TRIM59 was highly expressed in CCA tissues. The knockdown of TRIM59 obviously reduced the proliferation and colony formation abilities of CCA cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the cell apoptosis analysis results showed that TRIM59 silencing apparently promoted CCA cell apoptosis by the mitochondrial pathway. Our preliminary results indicate that the down-regulation of TRIM59 levels might restrict the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway. Conclusions: Our study revealed that TRIM59 is up-regulated in CCA tissues and cell lines and promoted CCA cell proliferation, possibly by affecting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biomarker; Cholangiocarcinoma; PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway; Proliferation; TRIM59",Article,Scopus

Since 1917, mistletoe preparations have been applied in cancer therapy and today are the most frequently used complementary medicine in tumor treatment. The main cytotoxic constituents of Viscum album are lectins and viscotoxins. Aim of the study: The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the antiproliferative potential of Viscum album preparations from different host trees and to assess the impact of mistletoe lectin 1 (ML-1) and viscotoxin A (VT-A) in comparison to a structurally similar lectin and thionin. Materials and methods: By means of widely accepted 2D Alamar Blue Assay, based on population counting of living cells using a fluorescent cell viability dye, the potential impact to inhibit tumor cell of the mistletoe preparations (Iscucin ® ) and their single compounds (ML-1 and VT-A) on the cell growth of six human cancer cell lines were evaluated. Also the mixture of ML-1 and VT-A corresponding to the contents in the specific mistletoe preparations were monitored. Ricin and purothionin were used as reference lectin and reference thionin, respectively. Results: The lung carcinoma cell line HCC827 was very sensitive to the Iscucin ® preparations. Very strong antiproliferative effects were found with Iscucin ® Salicis and Tiliae and a strong with Iscucin ® Crataegi, Mali and Populi. The IC 50 concentrations of the Iscucin ® preparations correlated with their respective ML-1 contents, but the ML-1 levels were much lower than the IC 50 concentration of isolated ML-1 (1 ng/ml – 56 ng/ml). ML-1 was much more effective than ricin. Iscucin ® preparations, ML-1 and ricin showed antiproliferative activity on human tumor cells. VT-A and purothionin had no effect on cell viability in the concentration ranges tested. Conclusion: The complete mistletoe extract is more potent to inhibit tumor cell proliferation than isolated ML-1 at an equivalent concentration level. Phenolic compounds found in all Iscucin ® preparations might contribute to uphold the cytotoxic activity of ML-1 by antioxidative action. However, further studies are necessary to evaluate the role of VT-A and possible synergistic actions to the antiproliferative effect of aqueous mistletoe extracts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Antiproliferative; Cancer; Lectin; Mistletoe; Ricin; Viscotoxin",Article,Scopus

Genomic alteration of oncogenes might result in oncogenesis and promotion of cancer progression. To date, researchers have focused mainly on the roles of oncogenes in particular cancers, but investigation of oncogenes with gain-of-function mutations in multiple cancer types are less represented in the literature. Furthermore, the effect of those gain-of-function are not validated in gene expression level. To meet this demand, we performed a systematic analysis of gene expression in oncogenes to identify the occurrence of gain-of-function mutations in pan-cancer. We identified 33,551 oncogenic mutations in 5000 samples. From our analysis, we identified three tissues with the highest frequency of gain-of-functional oncogenic mutations in hundreds of samples: breast (739 samples), central nervous system (646 samples) and large intestine (498 samples). By further counting the number of occurrences of oncogenes across cancer types, we identified a list cross-cancer mutational signatures of 99 oncogenes highly mutated in >400 samples in breast, central nervous system and large intestine samples. By further overlapping with gene expression data in the matched tumor samples, we further identified 1875 gain-of-functional mutations/events with consistent gene up-regulation in 1031 samples from multiple cancers. This result may offer additional insight into the relationship between gene dosage and oncogenesis and maybe useful in targeted cancer therapy. In summary, this study provides the first globally examining on the genetic alteration of oncogenes across cancer types. Clinical association analysis has shown that these 99 genes have a significant effect on survival. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cancer genomics; Oncogenes; Pathway analysis; System biology",Article,Scopus

Method: The levels of miR-451 were tested in colon cancer cell lines (SW480 and SW48). Multiple functional and immunological assays were performed to analyse miR-451 induced growth changes in-vitro and downstream effects on target proteins. Results: Overexpression of miR-451 in colon cancer cells led to reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis and decrease accumulation of the cells at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. In addition, a significant increase in the number of the cells was noted in the G2-M phase of cell cycle. Moreover, miR-451 reduced the expression of Oct-4, Sox-2 and Snail indicating its role in stem cell and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulation. An inverse correlation between miR-451 and macrophage migration inhibitory protein (MIF) protein expression occurred in colon cancer cells.

Using area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve assess the sensitivity and specificity of prognostic model. Results: 530 patients were randomly divided into training set and testing set.

Importantly, we found that PVT1 could facilitate cell autophagy in HCC cells. Then, we confirmed that the effect of PVT1 promoting autophagy was dependent on regulating ATG3 expression. Further investigations revealed that PVT1 could upregulate autophagy-related gene 3 (ATG3) expression by acting as an endogenous sponge of miR-365, which was an inhibitor gene on ATG3 protein by targeting 3′UTR of ATG3 mRNA. Moreover, rescue assays indicated that the effect of PVT1 on autophagy of HCC cells were dependent on miR-365.

Choices of these datasets with difference geographic characteristics (e.g., accuracy, scales, and variations) in disease burden studies can significantly impact the results. The objective of this study is to revisit the estimations of PM 2.5 -attributable mortality by taking advantage of recent advancements in high resolution mapping of PM 2.5 concentrations and fine scale of mortality statistics and to explore the impacts of new data sources, geographic scales, and spatial variations of input datasets on mortality estimations. We estimate the PM 2.5 -mortality for the years of 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 using three PM 2.5 concentration datasets [Chemical Transport Model (CTM), random forests-based regression kriging (RFRK), and geographically weighted regression (GWR)] at two resolutions (i.e., 10 km and 1 km) and mortality rates at two geographic scales (i.e., regional-level and county-level). The results show that the estimated PM 2.5 -mortality from the 10 km CTM-derived PM 2.5 dataset tend to be smaller than the estimations from the 1 km RFRK- and GWR-derived PM 2.5 datasets. The estimated PM 2.5 -mortalities from regional-level mortality rates are similar to the estimations from those at county level, while large deviations exist when zoomed into small geographic regions (e.g., county). In a scenario analysis to explore the possible benefits of PM 2.5 concentrations reduction, the uses of the two newly developed 1 km resolution PM 2.5 datasets (RFRK and GWR) lead to discrepant results. Furthermore, we found that the change in PM 2.5 concentration is the primary factor that leads to the PM 2.5 -attributable mortality decrease from 2000 to 2015. The above results highlight the impact of the adoption of input datasets from new sources with varied geographic characteristics on the PM 2.5 -attributable mortality estimations and demonstrate the necessity to account for these impact in future disease burden studies.

Such research is largely based on studies of late effects in school-aged or older children. However, far less is known about executive function weaknesses in preschool-aged children treated for cancer. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine executive functioning in a clinically referred sample of young oncology patients, and its association with broader domains of functioning. Data from 61 young children with cancer, who were referred for clinical cognitive evaluations, were abstracted and included in this study. Patients were 5.00 years of age (SD = 0.72) at assessment, 54.1% male, and two-thirds (63.9%) had been treated for brain tumors. Most executive functions were significantly discrepant from the mean, with 47.5% of preschoolers having parent-reported working memory concerns within the clinically significant range. There were no differences in executive functioning based on diagnosis or treatment status. Parent-reported executive functioning was strongly correlated with global intelligence and adaptive functioning, with some indices also associated with nonverbal problem solving and pre-academic skills. Ultimately, results indicate the presence of emerging weaknesses in executive functioning in young children with cancer, and add to a growing body of literature highlighting the potential cognitive and behavioral risks associated with a cancer diagnosis in early childhood. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","childhood cancer; Executive functioning; pre-academic skills; preschool; young children",Article,Scopus

Furthermore, we found miR-515-5p was negatively correlated with TRIP13 mRNA and protein expression in prostate cancer tissue samples, and miR-515-5p directly targeted TRIP13 3′-UTR and negatively regulated TRIP13 mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, miR-515-5p acted as a tumor suppressor to regulate cell proliferation, migration and invasion via targeting TRIP13 in prostate cancer. Besides, we observed that miR-515-5p expression in prostate cancer patients with advanced T stage subgroup or high Gleason score was significantly lower than its expression in prostate cancer patients with early T stage or low Gleason score.

Moreover, a new trend is being emerged in clinical oncology to shift from monotherapy toward combination therapy in the presence of useful nanomaterials. This way, the synergistic interactions occur among different treatments, which result in much stronger therapeutic effect than separate use of corresponding monotherapies. Recently, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been widely implemented as one of the leading nanomaterials for combinatorial cancer therapy. In this review article, the importance and benefits of AuNPs in the field of combinatorial cancer therapy are firstly explained. Then, the applications of AuNPs in the most clinically established cancer therapy modalities, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and a variety of hyperthermia methods will be described. Recent progresses in the application of AuNPs in dual- and triple-modality cancer therapies will be reviewed. Also, a brief summary of the role of AuNPs in photodynamic therapy and gene therapy will be provided.

For the aptamers, we use previously developed synthetic single stranded (ss) DNA aptamers mammaglobin B1 (MAMB1) and mammaglobin A2 (MAMA2) that bind to mammaglobin B and mammaglobin A proteins, respectively, which are overexpressed on the surface of MCF7 and MDA-MB-415 breast cancer cells. Each aptamer was immobilized on the surface of a sensing plate, and the amplitude of the THz signal was measured upon the binding of each aptamer to different number (10–10 6 ) of its target breast cancer cells. A change in the THz amplitude was observed when MAMB1 and MAMA2 bind to MCF7 and MDA-MB-415, respectively. We find that this change was linear as a function of the log number of breast cancer cells used. No change in the THz amplitude was observed when the same number of normal breast cells (MCF 10A) were used.

MTT, wound-healing, and transwell assays were used to evaluate cell biological function. Cisplatin with different concentrations was used to treat cells in different transfection groups, and MTT assays were used to detect the cell growth inhibition rate and the half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) of cisplatin was measured. Cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. A xenograft mouse model was used to investigate the effects of siR-ZFAS1 on the chemosensitivity to cisplatin. Results: ZFAS1 was significantly upregulated in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines, and increased ZFAS1 levels led to poor prognoses in patients. In addition, cells in the siR-ZFAS1 group showed remarkably reduced ZFAS1 expression as well as cell proliferation, invasion and migration. After being treated with cisplatin at different concentrations, cells in the siR-ZFAS1 group had dramatically increased cell growth inhibition and apoptosis but lower cisplatin IC50s. In addition, siR-ZFAS1 reduced the volumes and weights of tumors in nude mice treated with cisplatin and enhanced the chemosensitivity of cervical cancer cells to cisplatin.

The goal is to estimate cancer and non-cancer health risks due to the consumption of foods of animal origin. The area has relatively higher concentration of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs in the air in comparison to large industrialized cities of the Silesia province. Three popular foods of animal origin, namely free-range chicken meat, free-range chicken eggs, and cow milk produced in the farms were used. The control samples were the same foods from the local grocery stores. Two exposure scenarios were considered: Firstly that residents consumed free-range foods and secondly that the food items were purchased from stores in the study area. In the first scenario, exposure to concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, and dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs) yielded evidence of elevated cancer and non-cancer risks. The hazard quotient (HQ) was 71.3 for non-cancer risk and 7.5 × 10 −3 for cancer risk. The health risk from exposure to PCDDs, PCDFs and dl-PCBs in the second scenario was 6.9 × 10 −4 and HQ = 0.8, respectively.

This is particularly true in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, an indolent neoplastic disease of B-lymphocytes which eventually causes the immune system's failure. In this and other areas of cancer research, mathematical modeling is pointed out as a prominent tool to analyze theoretical and practical issues. Its lack in studies of chemoimmunotherapy of chronic lymphocytic leukemia is what motivated us to come up with a simple ordinary differential equation model. It is based on ideas of de Pillis and Radunskaya and on standard pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics assumptions. In order to check the positivity of the state variables, we first establish an invariant region where these time-dependent variables remain positive. Afterwards, the action of the immune system, as well as the chemoimmunotherapeutic role in promoting cancer cure are investigated by means of numerical simulations and the classical linear stability analysis. The role of adoptive cellular immunotherapy is also addressed. Our overall conclusion is that chemoimmunotherapeutic protocols can be effective in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia provided that chemotherapy is not a limiting factor to the immunotherapy efficacy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Cancer; Chemotherapy; Chronic lymphocytic leukemia; Immunotherapy; Ordinary differential equations",Article,Scopus

Moreover, we observed that triptolide induced ESCC cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase and apoptosis through cyclin D1-CDK4/6 regulation and caspases activation. In addition, we revealed that triptolide regulates cell apoptosis and metastasis by p53 and mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathway, respectively.

Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) possess significant anticancer effects, but poor water solubility and dispersity. Therefore, an effective nanocomposite was designed in order to enhance the stability and anticancer effects of SeNPs decorated with CPA. Water soluble and dispersed selenium nanoparticles (CPA-SeNPs) were fabricated using CPA and Na 2 SeO 3 by redox reaction with ascorbic acid. The average diameter of CPA-SeNPs was 53.7 ± 4.0 with a Se content of approximately 171.4 mg/g. CPA-SeNPs showed a significant anti-proliferative effect on HeLa cells in vitro. Since these NPs could induce apoptosis and S phase arrest. The apoptotic pathway triggered by CPA-SeNPs on HeLa cells was also characterized as induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of caspase-3.

However, the functional roles of lncRNA-mediated ceRNAs in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have rarely been reported. Here, we construct a hypothetical ceRNA network by analyzing differential expression of lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs obtained from 96 ESCC tissues and 13 normal tissues in the Cancer Genome Atlas.

HNRNPA1 expression was found to be significantly higher in HBV-positive HCC samples, which was supported with IHC validation. Both GO and KEGG analyses demonstrated that HNRNPA1 co-expressed genes were involved in translation, ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis and assembly, ribosome biogenesis, RNA processing, RNA splicing, etc. Survival analysis showed a significant reduction in overall survival of patients with high HNRNPA1 expression from both the GSE14520 cohort and 151 patients with HBV-related HCC cohort.

Tunability of aptamer selection makes them ideal for that challenge. However, aptamer characterization is a time-consuming task, not always thoroughly addressed, leading to suboptimal aptamer performance. In this work, we report on the affinity characterization and potential usage of two aptamers against a candidate cancer biomarker, the neutrophil gelatinase–associated lipocalin (NGAL). Electrochemical sandwich assays on Au electrodes and SPR experiments showed a restricted capture ability of one of the aptamers (LCN2–4) and a small detectability of the other (LCN2-2). Interestingly, a truncated version of the signaling aptamer LCN2-2 selectively binds to NGAL covalently linked to magnetic beads due to high local protein concentration. The functional affinity of this aptamer is enhanced by three-orders of magnitude using rolling circle amplification (RCA), completed in only 15 min, followed by hybridization with short complementary fluorescein-tag probes, enzyme labeling and chronoamperometric measurement. Microscale thermophoresis experiments show a poor affinity for the protein in solution, which urges the importance of a full and in-depth characterization of aptamers to be used as diagnostic reagents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aptamer characterization; Electrochemical detection; Microscale thermophoresis; NGAL; Rolling circle amplification",Article,Scopus

This paper proposes a novel strategy of intrinsic fluorescence coupled with four-way calibration method for simultaneous quantitative analysis of intracellular metabolic coenzymes FAD and FMN. Through mathematical separation, this proposed analytical method efficiently achieved the simultaneous quantitative analysis of metabolic coenzymes FAD and FMN in the cell, despite the fact that uncalibrated spectral interferents coexist in the system. The predicted concentrations of FAD and FMN in the cell are 217.0 ± 6.9 and 155.0 ± 1.7 pmol/10 6 cells respectively, which were validated by the approved liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. This analytical method with second-order advantage simply requires the cell solution to be diluted by a buffer, it could introduce an interesting analytical strategy for multianalyte direct quantitative analysis in complex biological systems.

Here, a T7 exonuclease (T7 Exo)-assisted and target-triggered cascade dual recycling signal amplification strategy was developed for the sensitive and specific detection of adenosine. In this strategy, a capture strand (Cap)-inhibit strand (Inh) duplex and a DNA hairpin with intact G-quadruplex sequence are designed. In the presence of adenosine, Cap binds with adenosine specifically to form Cap-adenosine complex with recessed 5′-hydroxyl termini, causing the release of Inh. Under the action of T7 Exo, the adenosine is released from Cap-adenosine complex. Then the released adenosine interacts with the next Cap-Inh duplex to promote the release of a new Inh and the recycle I is completed. After that, the released Inh hybridizes with hairpin to form Inh-hairpin duplex with blunt 5′ -hydroxyl termini. Under the same action of T7 Exo, the Inh gets released and a G-quadruplex sequence is obtained. Subsequently, the released Inh continues opening hairpin and the recycle II is accomplished. Finally, plenty of G-quadruplex sequences are generated and then interact with N-methyl-mesoporphyrin IX (NMM) to obtain enhanced fluorescence signal. The limit of detection (LOD) of the proposed strategy is estimated to be 9.8 × 10 −7 mol L −1 , and the linear range of the strategy is from 5.0 × 10 −6 mol L −1 to 7.0 × 10 −4 mol L −1 . Besides, the proposed strategy is capable of distinguishing adenosine from its analogues.

The therapeutic intervention is necessary for synthesizing robust pharmaceuticals and to unlock the mechanistic aspects of pathogens involved in diseases. These therapeutic regimes have diverted from traditional target DNA to new exciting novel targets viz., structured proteins, enzyme receptors, ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles and non-coding RNAs. RNA has much attractive prospectus as an antitumor therapeutic target being involved in many essential biochemical, genetic and epigenetic functions of the cell. The structural flexibility of RNA both in secondary and tertiary structure owing to which selective binding based on structures rather than sequence is possible while RNP particles have exhibited reasonable therapeutic success in the antibacterial area. RNA was much ignored and underexploited target due to difficulty in characterisation and unavailability of sensitive biophysical/biochemical techniques to study its intricate three-dimensional folds. However, recent developments have provided valuable insights into RNA targets, and its binding abilities, the small molecule RNA–based drugs have emerged, and many antitumor lead compounds targeted to RNA including organic dyes, intercalative cations, aminoglycoside antibiotics and inorganic metal complexes were isolated, and some of them have reached clinical trial phases in drug discovery. Interestingly, the development of high-resolution RNA structural analysis, using both X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has clearly made a profound impact in this area. In the present review, we are looking at more naïve options of modulating drug discovery strategies involving metallodrugs derived from transition metal ions which are targeted to ncRNAs. Metal complexes exhibit diversity in size and structure beyond the geometries of carbon, possess photophysical and electrochemical properties and therefore are considered as an important class of structure-selective binding agents for nucleic acids.

The prognostic value of mortalin was analyzed using Meier plotter database and Kaplan-Meier. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide) assay, immunofluorescence (IF) staining, and colony formation assay were used to detect cell reproductive capacity. SK-OV-3 cell motility and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were measured by wound-healing, migration and western-blot assays. Data from Oncomine showed that mortalin was highly expressed in serous ovarian carcinomas compared with corresponding normal controls. Similar results were found in CCLE analysis and in clinical specimens. High mortalin expression was associated with high histological grade and worse overall survival (OS) rate. The results of MTT analyses, IF staining, and colony formation assay indicated that MKT-077 (1-Ethyl-2-[[3-ethyl-5-(3-methyl-2(3H)-benzothiazolylidene)-4-oxo-2-thiazolidinylidene] methyl]-pyridinium chloride) suppressed the viability of SK-OV-3 cells.

MiR-185 expression was reduced in OS tissues and OS cell lines. MiR-185 inhibited OS cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, a dual-luciferase assay validated that vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) was a direct target of miR-185. Overexpression of miR-185 in OC cells reduced VAMP2 expression in protein and mRNA levels, whereas suppression of miR-185 led to an increase in VAMP2 protein and mRNA levels.

Further studies verified that introducing VAMP2 mRNA into cells over-expressing miR-185 abrogated the effects of miR-185 on OS cell proliferation, migration and invasion.

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation on glucose and insulin tolerance, exercise performance, production of urinary neopterin and striatal neurotransmitters levels in adult male C57BL/6 mice. Increased blood glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity were observed after a single administration of glucose (2 g/kg, p.o.) or insulin (0.5 U/kg, i.p.). However, the repeated injection of LPS (0.33 mg/kg/day, i.p.) decreased glucose tolerance and increase urinary neopterin levels, pointing to systemic inflammation. In parallel to the urinary-increased neopterin, it was observed a significant reduction in the striatal dopamine levels and an increase in the serotonin/dopamine ratio. While a single LPS injection (0.33 mg/kg, i.p.) showed impaired performance in the incremental loading test (10 m/min, with 2 m/min increment every 3 min, at 9% grade), a moderate physical exercise protocol (treadmill for three weeks; 5 sessions/week; up to 50 min/day) prevented the exacerbation of immune system activation and preserved mitochondrial activity in skeletal muscle from mice with continuous LPS infusion (infusion pumps: 0.83 mg/kg/day, i.p.).

In addition, the expression level change of selected five microRNAs (hsa-miR-4299, hsa-miR-297, hsa-miR-3135b, hsa-miR-9-3p, and hsa-miR-371b-5p) and two mRNAs(CASK and CDK6) were validated in cisplatin-induced HK-2 cells. Furthermore, a similar trend of expression level change was observed in NRK-52E cells by cisplatin treatment.

Besides antimicrobial properties, LL-37 also contributes to the pathophysiology of various diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and cancer. Non-covalent association of antiinflammatory drugs, porphyrin pigments, bile salts and food dyes to the peptide was uncovered and evaluated by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. These agents induce the disorder-to-order conformational transition of the natively unstructured LL-37 leading to its helical folding. Even in the presence of chloride ions, when LL-37 is partially folded, the inducers were able to rise the α-helix content. CD titration data indicated positive cooperativity between the ligand molecules accommodated to the peptide chain resulting in multimeric complexes with apparent dissociation constants ranged from 2 to 500 μM. Computational docking suggested the prominent role of the Lys8-Arg19 segment in the accommodation of small molecules, governed principally by salt bridges and H-bonding. Since pleiotropic biological functions of LL-37 are strongly conformation-dependent, it could be anticipated that folding inducer compounds may modulate its in vivo actions and also of related cationic peptides. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Antiinflammatory drugs; Bile acid; Circular dichroism; Food dyes; Helical folding; Hemin; Intrinsic disorder; LL-37",Article,Scopus

For this purpose, the polymerization was achieved by electrical stimulus on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)-glass modified with a homemade carbon ink (hCCI). The biomimetic material was assembled on top of this surface, by moulding CEA at the molecular level around a polyaminophenol (PAP) polymeric matrix. The CEA biomarker was previously incubated in the presence or not of aminophenylboronic acid (APBA), to evaluate the effect of negative charges at the rebinding site. Then, aminophenol (AP) monomer was electropolymerized on the modified FTO glass, acting as working electrode. The template was removed by enzymatic action. Likewise, a control material having only PAP and no CEA was also prepared. The resulting sensing films were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV), and the chemical modifications on these after each stage of the assembly process was followed by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopies. Imprinted devices displayed good linear responses to CEA in EIS assays from 2.5 ng/mL to 1.5 μg/mL in phosphate buffer solution (PBS). A promising detection of CEA was, also, achieved in spiked foetal bovine serum (FBS) samples, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 3 ng/mL. Overall, the devices developed herein are promising tools for monitoring CEA in point-of-care (POC) applications, being able to detect lower concentrations than those in normal physiological levels. In addition, the biosensors offer low cost, high sensitivity and good selectivity, and may be used to couple to other reading devices. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biological samples; Cancer biomarkers; Protein surface imprinting; Solid conductive support",Article,Scopus

But information on their contamination and human exposure in the indoor environment especially dormitories in northern China is rare. In this study, twelve OPFRs were investigated in college dormitory dust that collected from Harbin, Shenyang, and Baoding, in northern China. Indoor dust samples were also collected from homes and public microenvironments (PMEs) in Harbin for comparison. The median ∑OPFR concentrations in dormitory dust in Shenyang samples (8690 ng/g) were higher than those in Baoding (6540 ng/g) and Harbin (6190 ng/g). The median ∑OPFR concentrations in home dust (7150 ng/g) were higher than in dormitory and PME dust (5340 ng/g) in Harbin. Tris(2‑chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) and tris (2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) were the most abundant chlorinated OPFRs, while triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) and tris(2‑butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) were the dominant non-chlorinated OPFRs. The daily intakes of ∑OPFR were estimated, with the median values for female students (2.45 ng/kg-day) higher than those for male students (2.15 ng/kg-day) while were similar to adults (2.45 ng/kg-day) in homes. The estimated daily intakes (EDI) of these OPFRs from indoor dust in Harbin were all below the recommended values.

The two receptors lack the classical DNA-binding domain and act as the corepressors of other hNRs. The DAX1 and SHP contains three and two conserved LXXLL motifs, respectively, which can be recognized and bound by the activation function-2 (AF-2) domain of hNR proteins in agonist conformation. Here, we attempt to explore the systematic interaction profile between the five DAX1/SHP LXXLL motifs and all the 48 hNR AF-2 domains found in the human genome, to analyze the binding affinity and specificity of these motifs towards the complete domain array, and to design LXXLL-based, hydrocarbon-stapled peptides that can target the specific interaction profile for each motif. A weighted source–target network from motifs to domains is created based on the modeled domain–motif complex structures and calculated binding potencies, from which the specific interaction profile of each motif against the whole hNR array is depicted and clustered to measure the binding similarity and relationship among these motifs. Dynamics simulations reveal that the LXXLL-based peptides are highly flexible in free unbound state, thus unfavorable to be recognized and bound by AF-2 domains. Hydrocarbon-stapling technique is employed to help the constraint of these unstructured peptides to active helical conformation, thus largely improving their binding affinity to the hNR array. The hydrocarbon bridge is designed to point out of the domain's active pocket, which would not disrupt the direct interaction between the domain and peptide. Energetic decomposition imparts that the stapling has only a very modest influence on the interaction enthalpy and desolvation effect of domain–peptide binding, but can substantially reduce entropy penalty upon the binding. For a peptide ligand, the entropic reduction can be roughly regarded as a constant, which only improves (absolute) peptide binding affinity towards the whole domain array, but does not alter (relative) peptide binding specificity over different domains in the array. Overall, the stapled peptides can be considered as potent competitors to selectively target the specific interaction networks mediated by their parent LXXLL motifs in DAX1 and SHP proteins. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","AF-2 domain; DAX; Hydrocarbon stapling; LXXLL motif; Nuclear receptor; Peptide; SHP; Specific interaction network",Article,Scopus

However, the mechanism of MCP-1 in regulating the expression of P2X4R in microglia is poorly understood, and whether MCP-1 can aggravate pain via up-regulating spinal P2X4R expression in Cancer-induced Bone Pain (CIBP) remains unclear.

In response to MCP-1, the expression level of p-Akt was also increased and RS-504393 inhibited the increase. Besides, PI3K inhibitor LY 294002 could attenuate MCP-1-induced P2X4R expression in cultured microglia.

PAHs were quantified in sediments during the dry and wet seasons and were observed to be significantly higher in the wet season compared to the dry season. Also emerging from this study is that PAH levels were lower, in the areas where natural gas is the dominant energy source for industries, compared with those areas where crude oil-based fossil fuel is predominantly used. Perylene levels were demonstrated to be of biogenic origin near the protected wetland area. It was observed that nearshore sediment PAHs concentrations were higher than offshore levels. The sources of PAHs, identified by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) in the marine sediments, were vehicular combustion of gasoline and diesel, biomass burning, industrial combustion and oil spills.

Furthermore, inhibition of activated the ASIC2-mediated calcineurin/NFAT1 pathway and target gene transcript expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in parallel to reduce, and resulted in the reduced invasion ability by TER treatment. Conclusion: The potential pathways and targets that involved in glycolysis to excert the anti-CRC effects of main compounds in triterpenoids of Rhus chinensis Mill. were predicted by network pharmacology methods. Our findings thus provided rational evidence that inhibition of the ASIC2-induced calcineurin/NFAT pathway by triterpenoids in Rhus chinensis Mill. profoundly suppressed cell growth and invasion in CRC, which target alternative glycolysis in colorectal tumor cells, may be a useful adjuvant therapy in the treatment of colorectal cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Acidosis; ASIC2; Betulinic acid (PubChem CID: 64971); Betulonic acid (PubChem CID: 122844); Colorectal cancer; Metastasis; NFAT1",Article,Scopus

We investigated the distribution of total THM (tTHM) 0.05 m and 0.60 m above the water surface at six different locations in the poolroom and the covariation between the water and air quality parameters. Based on a linear mixed effects model, the most important determinants in terms of predicting the air concentration of CHCl 3 were height above water surface, air changes of fresh air per hour, concentration of combined chlorine in the water, relative humidity (RH) and day of the week. Approximately 36% of the total variability could be attributed to these variables; hence, to reduce the average exposure in the poolroom, hazard control should focus on these variables.

D. Koenig) (Sapindaceae) is used in Sub-Saharan Africa (where it has its origin) and in different parts of the world (The Caribbean, North and South America, Europe). Traditionally it is used to manage numerous ailments like backache, constipation, cancer, fever in young children, gonorrhea, dysentery, psychosis, hernia, stomach ache, malaria, rheumatism, typhoid etc. It is also used as a cosmetic and food source. The fruit aril is the main constituent of the Jamaican National Dish. This review summarizes its phytochemistry, nutritional properties, ethnobotany and pharmacology. The need to gather up to date information on this plant, to facilitate in vivo and in vitro investigations for verification of some of the local claims necessitated this review. Materials and methods: A literature search was performed on Ackee using ethno botanical text books and scientific databases such as PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, Science-direct, Google, Google Scholar and other web sources like records from PROTA, PROSEA, JSTOR and Botanical Dermatology Database. Results and discussion: This review highlights the traditional uses of parts of the Ackee plant: the bark, the leaves, capsules, roots and seeds. They are used in the management of diverse disease conditions such as diarrhoea, conjunctivitis, fever, internal hemorrhage, dysentery, cutaneous skin infections, and bacterial infections amongst others. Only nineteen compounds have been reportedly isolated from the parts of B. sapida; Alkaloids, quinines, polyphenols, and steroids, their glycosides, sesquiterpenes and triterpenes. Some of the plant extracts and its isolated compounds showed anticancer, antimicrobial, antidiarrheal, antioxidant and hypoglycemic activities both in vitro and in vivo. The seed/leaves have also been used as insect repellants and the leaves have been reported to have lethal effects on larvae of various mosquitoes’ species. The oil contains a lot of nutrients and may be considered for edible consumption after safety has been confirmed. Hypoglycin A and the less malignant hypoglycin B are found in the unripe aril of Ackee and consumption results in hypoglycemia, vomiting, gluconeogenesis disruption which can result in coma and death. The untapped economic potential of its fruits is glaring in West Africa countries. Conclusion: Though B.sapida has been put to enormous traditional use, the pharmacological studies conducted are not sufficient, most studies are either in-vivo or in-vitro. More work is required (well-designed pharmacological tests, randomized clinical trials) to evaluate these medicinal claims. This review provides a basis for future research. The isolation of more compounds,detailed pharmacological investigations, exploration of food use and detoxification techniques are key areas to investigate. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Ackee; B. sapida; Hypoglycin A; Hypoglycin B; Phytochemistry",Review,Scopus

Wight et Arn is a vine distributed in southwest area of China and used in folk medicine for treatment of tumors. Recent decades of studies on this plant reveal its synergistic effects with certain anticancer drugs in cancer therapy. In our previous study, an extract ETA which contains total aglycones made from M. tenacissima significantly enhanced antitumor activity of paclitaxel in tumor-bearing mice. However, the effective constituents in ETA and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Aim of the study: Reveal the active components in ETA as well as the molecular mechanism in enhancing antitumor efficacy of paclitaxel. Material and methods: Main constituents in ETA were purified by chemical methods. Effects of the purified constituents on metabolic activity of CYP450 enzymes were evaluated in human liver microsomes. Ability of the constituents to enhance antitumor activity of paclitaxel were investigated in nude mice bearing HeLa tumors. Pharmacokinetic study was performed in SD rats. Molecular docking was carried out for investigation of drug-protein interactions. Results: Three main C 21 steroidal aglycones, 11α-O-tigloyl-12β-O-acetyl-tenacigenin B (MT1), 11α-O-2-methylbutanoyl-12β-O-tigloyl-tenacigenin B (MT2) and 11α-O-2-methylbutanoyl-12β-O-acetyl-tenacigenin B (MT3), together with tenacigenin B (MT4) was prepared from ETA. Among them, MT1, MT2 and MT3 strongly inhibit the metabolic activity of CYP3A4. MT2 also showed inhibitory effects on CYP2C8, CYP2B6 and CYP2C19. In HeLa tumor xenografts, MT1, MT2 and MT3 (30 mg/kg) did not affect tumor growth themselves, but significantly enhanced paclitaxel-induced growth inhibition. In addition, coadministration of MT2 with paclitaxel resulted in significant reduction of liver CYP2C8. In pharmacokinetic study, MT2 significantly increased the blood concentration of paclitaxel with increased AUC value by 2.2–5.3 folds. Molecular docking analysis suggested hydrophobic interaction modes of tenacigenin B derivatives with CYP3A4, and also the essential roles of the C-11 and C-12 ester groups for effective interaction with CYP3A4. Conclusion: Our study proves that, 11α-O-tigloyl-12β-O-acetyl-tenacigenin B, 11α-O-2-methylbutanoyl-12β-O-tigloyl-tenacigenin B and 11α-O-2-methylbutanoyl-12β-O-acetyl-tenacigenin B, which are the main constituents of ETA, are active inhibitors of CYP3A4 with potential to increase therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4.

Due to the ubiquitous nature of S-prenylation and its role in cellular functions, any defect in the biosynthesis or regulation of the isoprenoid leads to the occurrence of a variety of diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic issues, cardiovascular diseases and one of the most fatal diseases, cancer. This depicts the strong biological significance of S-prenylation, thus, the timely and accurate identification of S-prenylation sites is crucial and may provide with possible ways to understand the mechanism of this modification in proteins. To avoid laborious, resource demanding and expensive experimental techniques of identifying S-prenylation sites, here, we propose a novel predictor namely SPrenylC-PseAAC by integrating the Chou's Pseudo Amino Acid Composition (PseAAC) and relative/absolute position-based features. A 2-tier classification was performed i.e., at first level, identification of prenylation and non-prenylation sites is performed, while at the second level, identification of S-farnesylation and S-geranylgeranylation sites is performed. Using jackknife, perdition model validation gave 95.31% accuracy for tier-1 classification and 91.42% for tier 2 classification, while for 10-fold cross-validation, it gave 93.68% accuracy for tier-1 classification and 89.70% for tier 2 classification. Thus the proposed predictor can help in predicting the Prenylation sites in an efficient and accurate way.

Macropinocytosis plays a critical role for continuous proliferation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In this study, we generated a screening method and identified phellodendrine chloride (PC) as a potential macropinocytosis inhibitor. PC significantly inhibited the viability of KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1 and MiaPaCa-2) in a dose-dependent manner; however, it did not affect the wild type KRAS pancreatic cancer cells (BxPC-3). Further experiments indicated that PC reduced the growth of PANC-1 cells through inhibition of macropinocytosis and diminishing the intracellular glutamine level. Disruption of glutamine metabolism led to enhance the reactive oxygen species level and induce mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization in PANC-1 cells. PC treatment caused increased Bax and decreased Bcl-2 expression, along with the activation of cleaved caspase-3, 7, 9 and cleaved-PARP, thus induced mitochondrial apoptosis. Moreover, PC inhibited macropinocytosis in vivo and effectively reduced the growth of PANC-1 xenograft tumors.

However, acquired resistance inevitably emerges after a median of 6–12 months. It has been demonstrated that autophagy plays an important role in EGFR–TKI resistance. 20(S)-ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3) is proposed to sensitize the cancer cells to chemotherapy by inhibiting autophagy. We examined the ability of Rg3 to inhibit autophagy and increase the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to icotinib. We show that the induction of autophagy in response to icotinib contributes to the development of icotinib resistance. Rg3 is capable of inhibiting autophagic flux and enhancing the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to icotinib. The resistance to icotinib could also be reversed through Rg3-induced autophagy inhibition. Autophagy inhibition by Rg3 increases the therapeutic response in both icotinib-sensitive and icotinib-resistant NSCLC cells with an EGFR-activating mutation and may be an effective new treatment strategy for this disease. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","20(S)-ginsenoside Rg3; Autophagy; Epidermal growth factor receptor; Non-small-cell lung cancer; Tyrosine kinase inhibitors",Article,Scopus

Sevoflurane is one inhalational anesthesia which regulates migration and invasion in varying cancers. However, the effect of sevoflurane on CRC cells and its mechanism remain poorly understood. In this study, SW620 and HCT116 cells were treated with different concentrations of sevoflurane for 6 h in vitro. We measured the effect of sevoflurane on cell survival, migration and invasion by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide or trans-well assays. Moreover, we explored the interaction between sevoflurane and miR-203 and Roundabout1 (Robo1) as well as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) pathway. Results showed that sevoflurane inhibited cell migration and invasion in SW620 and HCT116 cells in a concentration dependent manner. Moreover, different concentrations of sevoflurane suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK. miR-203 expression was impaired while sevoflurane reversed the expression of miR-203 in CRC cells. In addition, inhibition of miR-203 attenuated the inhibitory effect of sevoflurane on cell migration, invasion and phosphorylated ERK level. Notably, MMP-9, as a downstream of ERK, was involved in sevoflurane-mediated processes in CRC cells. Besides, Robo1 was indicated as a target of miR-203 and inhibited by sevoflurane treatment. These results indicated that sevoflurane suppressed cell migration and invasion through regulating ERK/MMP-9 pathway via miR-203/Robo1 in CRC cells, indicating important clinical implications for anesthetic agents to prevent metastasis in CRC. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Colorectal cancer; Invasion; Migration; MiR-203; Sevoflurane",Article,Scopus

Zinc phthalocyanine shows a complex water dependence behavior in the mixture. At least three distinct steps were observed: (i) until 30% water zinc phthalocyanine is essentially in the monomeric form, changing to (ii) small slipped cofacial-aggregates around 30% to 40% water and finally to (iii) a staircase arrangement of large aggregates at higher water percent. The staircase arrangement is driven by the intermolecular coordination between the pyrrolic nitrogen lone-pairs and the central metal zinc.

This study was aimed to investigate TRIM66 expression and its potential biological function in HCC cell lines. Here we showed that TRIM66 expression was significantly upregulated in HCC cell lines compared with normal control cells. Loss-of-function experiments by RNA interfering knockdown of TRIM66 showed that TRIM66 inhibition significantly reduced the proliferation, colony formation, and invasion of HCC cells, whereas gain-of-function by overexpression of TRIM66 exhibited the opposite effect. Further investigation showed that TRIM66 was involved in regulating glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylation and β-catenin expression. Knockdown of TRIM66 impeded the activation of Wnt signaling, while overexpression of TRIM66 promoted Wnt signaling activation. Moreover, inhibition of GSK-3β by specific inhibitor partially reversed TRIM66 inhibition-mediated antitumor effect, while knockdown of β-catenin blocked the oncogenic effect of TRIM66 overexpression in HCC cells. Additionally, in vivo experiments using a xenograft tumor model showed that TRIM66 knockdown blunted the tumorigenicity of HCC cells associated with downregulation of β-catenin expression.

Rutin is a quercetin based-flavanoid and a famous dietary supplement. It is a potential protector from coronary heart disease, cancers, and inflammatory bowel disease. In this study, amyloid fibrillation is reported in BLG at pH 2.0 and temperature 358 K. It is inhibited to some extent by rutin with a rate of 99.3 h −1 M −1 . Amyloid fibrillation started taking place after 10 h of incubation and completed near 40 h at a rate of 16.6 × 10 −3 h −1 , with a plateau during 40–108 h. Disruption of tertiary structure of BLG and increased solvent accessibility of hydrophobic core seem to trigger intermolecular assembly. Increase in 7% β-sheet structure at the cost of 10% α-helical structures and the electron micrograph of BLG fibrils at 108 h further support the formation of amyloid. Although it could not block amyloidosis completely, and even the time required to reach plateau remains the same, a decrease of growth rate from 16.6 × 10 −3 to 13.5 × 10 −3 h −1 was observed in the presence of 30.0 μM rutin. Rutin seems to block solvent accessibility of the hydrophobic core of BLG. A decrease in the fibril population was observed in electron micrographs, with the increase in rutin concentration.

The results indicated that Schiff bases behaved as a tridentate NNO chelator that coordinates to the metal ions by azomethine nitrogen, pyrimidine nitrogen and phenolic oxygen, demonstrating 1 to 1 (metal to ligand) ratio. The measurements of conductivity revealed a nonelectrolytic nature of the complexes. Electronic absorption and viscosity were used to explore the ability of investigated complexes to bind to DNA, and the results indicated that binding occurred through intercalation. The antimicrobial activities of the considered complexes were evaluated against some types of fungi and bacteria. Metal complexes exhibited more antimicrobial activity as compared to their ligands. Interestingly, the CuL 3 showed the highest antimicrobial activity. The anticancer activity of the chelators and their metal complexes were investigated on hepatic cellular and human colon carcinoma cells (HepG-2 cell line) and (HCT-116 cell line), respectively.

However, the behavior of the conjugate will largely depend on the bulkiness of the AuNP and small sizes are moreover preferable for diffusion. Water-soluble thiolate-protected AuNPs having diameters of 2-3 nm can be synthesized with narrow polydispersity and can selectively react with incoming organic thiols via a SN2-like mechanism. We therefore synthesized a mixed thionitrobenzoic acid- , thioaminobenzoic acid-monolayered AuNP of 2.4 nm in diameter and developed a site-selective conjugation strategy to link the AuNP to Cetuximab, an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody used in clinic. The water-soluble 80 kDa AuNP was fully characterized and then reacted to the hinge area of Cetuximab, which was selectively reduced using mild concentration of TCEP. The conjugation proceeded smoothly and could be analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating the formation of a 1:1 AuNP-IgG conjugate as the main product. When added to EGFR expressing glioblastoma cells, the AuNP-Cetuximab conjugate selectively bound to the cell surface receptor, inhibited EGFR autophosphorylation and entered into endosomes like Cetuximab. Altogether, we describe a simple and robust protocol for a site-directed conjugation of a thiolate-protected AuNP to Cetuximab, which could be easily monitored, thereby allowing to assess the quality of the product formation. The conjugated 2.4 nm AuNP did not majorly affect the biological behavior of Cetuximab, but provided it with the electronic properties of the AuNP.

A comparison to the uptake kinetics for healthy L929 cells is given. The experimental results are used for the development of an uptake kinetics model describing the three relevant internalization processes: ML adsorption to the cell membrane, endo- and exocytosis. By fitting of experimental data, the rate constant of each internalization process is determined enabling the prediction of internalized ML at any incubation time. After seven hours incubation time, MiaPaCa-2 internalized three times more ML than BxPC-3 and L929 cells even though their ML adsorption rate constants were nearly the same. As the interaction of the ML with the cell membrane is non-specific, the uptake kinetics mirror the individual cell response to ML internalization.

The failure of a complete cure in colorectal cancer patients may be related to the lack of complete eradication of cancer stem cells when using conventional therapy. Colorectal cancer stem cells comprise a small population of tumor cells that possess the properties of rapid proliferation and differentiation. The colorectal cancer stem cells are also phenotypically and molecularly distinct, and resistant to conventional chemo-radiotherapy. Therefore, it is important to identify approaches in combination with conventional therapy for targeting and eradicating cancer cells.

COX-2 is released by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), macrophage type 2 (M2) cells, and cancer cells to the tumor microenvironment (TME). COX-2 induces cancer stem cell (CSC)-like activity, and promotes apoptotic resistance, proliferation, angiogenesis, inflammation, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells. COX-2 mediated hypoxia within the TME along with its positive interactions with YAP1 and antiapoptotic mediators are all in favor of cancer cell resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. COX-2 exerts most of the functions through its metabolite prostaglandin E2. In some and limited situations, COX-2 may act as an antitumor enzyme. Multiple signals are contributed to the functions of COX-2 on cancer cells or its regulation. Members of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and nuclear factor-κβ are main upstream modulators for COX-2 in cancer cells. COX-2 also has interactions with a number of hormones within the body. Inhibition of COX-2 provides a high possibility to exert therapeutic outcomes in cancer. Administration of COX-2 inhibitors in a preoperative setting could reduce the risk of metastasis in cancer patients. COX-2 inhibition also sensitizes cancer cells to treatments like radio- and chemotherapy. Chemotherapeutic agents adversely induce COX-2 activity.

Epigenetic regulation contributes to lung cancer pathogenesis. The ADAMTS18 tumor suppressor gene is inactivated in some cancers, but its involvement in lung cancer has not been shown. Immunohistochemistry, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and methylation-specific PCR were used to assay ADAMTS18 expression and promoter methylation in lung tumor tissues and adjacent tissues. Cell viability, transwell, and wound-healing assays, as well as flow cytometry were used to characterize the biological activity of ADAMTS18. The influence of ADAMTS18 on protein expression was assayed using western blots analysis, and its effect on chemosensitivity was assayed by the response to cisplatin. We found that ADAMTS18 was silenced in lung cancer cells by promoter methylation. Demethylation by the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, with or without the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, restored ADAMTS18 expression. Compared with normal lung tissue, ADAMTS18 in lung tumors was frequently methylated. Overexpression of ADAMTS18 in lung cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, ADAMTS18 suppressed epidermal growth factor receptor/protein kinase B (EGFR/AKT) signaling, which sensitized lung cancer cells to cisplatin. Thus, our results demonstrated that the tumor suppressor gene ADAMTS18 was downregulated in lung cancer by promoter CpG methylation, and it promoted sensitivity to cisplatin via EGFR/AKT signaling. Our study suggests that ADAMTS18 promoter methylation is a potential epigenetic biomarker for early detection of lung cancer and warrants investigation as a therapeutic target for early-stage lung cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ADAMTS18; cisplatin; EGFR; lung cancer; p53",Article,Scopus

We investigated the expression of KLF5 and miR-145-5p messenger RNA (mRNA) in gastric cancer and then analyzed its role in the biological behavior of gastric cancer cells. Our results indicated that KLF5 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in 39.7% of the gastric cancer cases and was increased compared with that of the corresponding noncancerous normal mucosa (0.01 < p < 0.05).

Therefore, we focused on the biological function and molecular mechanism of SNHG12 in the tumorigenesis of cervical cancer. In this study, the expression of miR-125b was observably downregulated in cervical cancer cells. Meanwhile, the expression of SNHG12 was obviously upregulated in cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa, SiHa, Caski, C4-1, and C33A) compared with the immortalized cervical epithelial cells. The further assay showed that miR-125b was a target of SNHG12 in cervical cancer. Moreover, a negative relationship between miR-125b and SNHG12 was found in cervical cancer. In addition, SNHG12 inhibition restrained the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cervical cancer cells. Meanwhile, miR-125b mimics repressed the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). The further assay showed that STAT3 was a target of miR-125b in cervical cancer. In addition, sh-STAT3 repressed the migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells. Furthermore, it showed that miR-125b inhibitors reversed STAT3 expression restrained by the reduction of SNHG12 expression.

Little is presently known about current national practice patterns and sequencing of MMT. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of patients with gastric cancer aged 18 to 80 y in the National Cancer Database (2006-2014) with ≥T2 and/or node-positive disease (i.e., stage Ib to III) treated with MMT. Clinical nodal staging accuracy was ascertained among those treated with upfront surgery by comparing clinical and pathologic nodal staging. Multivariable Cox regression was used to evaluate the association between overall risk of death and MMT approach (i.e., radiation used versus not and treatment sequence). Results: Among 5817 patients, 16.1% received perioperative MMT, 50.6% preoperative only, and 33.3% postoperative only. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive values of clinical nodal staging were 68.4%, 88.8%, 91.1%, and 62.7%, respectively. Current clinical nodal staging modalities understage 37.3% of clinically node-negative patients. Over time, radiation utilization decreased (74.3% in 2006 versus 53.9% in 2014; trend test, P < 0.001), perioperative MMT increased (8.9% versus 22.2%%; trend test, P < 0.001), and postoperative MMT decreased (43.1% versus 21.0%; trend test, P < 0.001). Neither type of MMT nor treatment sequence is associated with risk of death. Conclusions: One-third of patients with gastric cancer who are candidates to receive MMT are treated with upfront surgery.

These percentages are even larger in high-income countries with 58% overweight/obese and 33% insufficiently active. Fourteen cancer types have been declared by the World Cancer Research Fund to be causally associated with being overweight or obese: oesophageal adenocarcinoma, stomach cardia, colon, rectum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, breast, endometrium, ovary, advanced/fatal prostate, kidney, thyroid and multiple myeloma. Colon, postmenopausal breast and endometrial cancers have also been judged causally associated with physical inactivity. We aimed to quantify the proportion of cancer cases that would be potentially avoidable in Australia if the prevalence of overweight/obesity and physical inactivity in the population could be reduced. We used the simulation modelling software PREVENT 3.01 to calculate the proportion of avoidable cancers over a 25-year period under different theoretical intervention scenarios that change the prevalence of overweight/obesity and physical inactivity in the population. Between 2013 and 2037, 10-13% of overweight/obesity-related cancers in men and 7-11% in women could be avoided if overweight and obesity were eliminated in the Australian population. If everyone in the population met the Australian physical activity guidelines for cancer prevention (i.e. engaged in at least 300 min of moderate-intensity physical activity per week), an estimated 2-3% of physical inactivity-related cancers could be prevented in men (colon cancer) and 1-2% in women (colon, breast and endometrial cancers).

In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential relevance of RPS15A in pancreatic cancer and elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanism. We found that RPS15A expression was significantly up-regulated in pancreatic cancer cell lines. RPS15A knockdown resulted in a decrease of cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phases of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. In addition, RPS15A knockdown down-regulated β-catenin expression and blocked the activation of Wnt signaling. Notably, RPS15A was identified as a target gene of microRNA-519d-3p (miR-519d-3p), a tumor suppressive miRNA. Further data showed that miR-519d-3p negatively regulated RPS15A expression in pancreatic cancer cells. Moreover, miR-591d-3p expression was significantly decreased in pancreatic cancer cell lines and tissues and was inversely correlated with RPS15A expression. The overexpression of miR-519d-3p significantly inhibited the proliferation and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in pancreatic cancer cells, mimicking the similar effect of RPS15A knockdown.

In this study, we discovered that DANCR was significantly elevated in cervical cancer tissues and cells, and was closely correlated with poor prognosis of cervical cancer patients. In addition, knockdown of DANCR inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of cervical cancer cells in vitro, indicating that DANCR functioned as an oncogene in cervical cancer. Moreover, we verified that DANCR could directly bind to miR-335-5p, isolating miR-335-5p from its target gene Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1). Functional analysis showed that DANCR regulated ROCK1 expression by competitively binding to miR-335-5p. Further cellular behavioral experiments revealed that miR-335-5p mimics and ROCK1 knockdown reversed the effects of upregulated DANCR on proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cervical cancer cells by rescue assays.

In this study, the function of PDK1 in cisplatin resistance of ovarian cancer in terms of growth and EMT was investigated. PDK1 was upregulated in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells. PDK1 knockdown in resistant cells led to increased sensitivity to cisplatin-induced cell death and apoptosis. PDK1 downregulation also reversed the EMT and cell motility in cisplatin-resistant cells. In a mouse xenograft model, tumors derived from PDK1-silenced ovarian cancer cells exhibited decreased tumor growth and EMT compared with control after the cisplatin treatment. Mechanistically, PDK1 overexpression led to increased phosphorylation of EGFR, and blocking EGFR kinase activity by erlotinib reversed cisplatin resistance induced by PDK1 overexpression. Furthermore, in patients with ovarian cancer, higher PDK1 and p-EGFR levels were associated with chemoresistance. These results supported that PDK1 contributes to chemoresistance of ovarian cancer by activating EGFR.

Methods: A Markov model was used to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 1-year adjuvant trastuzumab for patients with early-stage breast cancer who were considered human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu-positive with a societal perspective and lifetime horizon. The research variables were probability of health state change, health utility, and cost of treatment. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using probabilistic methods. A budget impact analysis was also performed. Results: The results revealed that the treatment cost and QALYs in the trastuzumab group yielded 4.59 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $3387 (THB 118 572; THB = Thai baht) per QALY. On the basis of the willingness-to-pay threshold in Thailand, a 1-year adjuvant trastuzumab treatment for breast cancer was a cost-effective therapy. Conclusions: A combination therapy that includes trastuzumab is a preferable choice and should be used in early-stage breast cancer treatment.

Decades of intensive research have revealed the critical roles of cellular signalling pathways in regulating complex cell behaviours which influence tumour development, growth and therapeutic response, and ultimately patient outcome. Most studies have focussed on specific pathways and the resulting tumour cell function in a rather linear fashion, partly due to the available methodologies and partly due to the traditionally reductionist approach to research. Advances in cancer research, including genomic technologies have led to a deep appreciation of the complex signals and pathway interactions operating in tumour cells.

Methods: Data from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort was used to examine the associations between baseline biomarkers of inflammation (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and CRP) and metabolism (adiponectin, resisting and lipoprotein (a)) with cancer mortality among 1822 participants cancer-free at baseline. Weighted Cox proportional hazard regression with the robust sandwich method was used to estimate the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for baseline covariates and stratified by BMI (normal, overweight/obese) given the significant interaction between biomarkers and BMI (p < 0.1). Results: During a mean follow-up of 8 years, there were statistically significant associations between cancer mortality and being in the highest vs. lowest tertile of IL-6 (HR: 5.3; 95% CI: 1.6, 17.8), CRP (HR: 3.4; 95% CI: 1.0, 11.2) and resistin (HR: 3.7; 95% CI: 1.2, 11.2) among participants with normal BMI.

While breast cancer can occur in both men and women, it is by far more prevalent in women. Researchers have developed computer-aided systems for efficient diagnosis of breast cancer from histopathological microscopic images. These systems have contributed to increased diagnosis efficiency of biopsy tissue using hematoxylin and eosin stained images. However, most computer-aided diagnosis systems have traditionally used handcrafted feature extraction methods that are both ineffective and time-consuming. In this study, we propose an approach that utilizes deep learning models with convolutional layers to extract the most useful visual features for breast cancer classification. It is shown that these deep learning models can extract better features than handcrafted feature extraction approaches. We also propose a novel boosting strategy to achieve the main goal, whereby the system is efficiently enriched by progressively combining deep learning models (weak classifiers) into a stronger classifier. Our system is used to classify hematoxylin and eosin stained breast biopsy images into two major groups (carcinomas and non-carcinomas) and four classes (normal tissues, benign lesions, in situ carcinomas and invasive carcinomas). We demonstrate applications to breast cancer histopathology images that have been considered challenging to diagnose based on conventional methodologies. Our results demonstrate that our breast cancer classifier with a boosting deep learning model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Breast cancer; Gradient boosting trees; Histopathological microscopic images; Inception network",Article,Scopus

Cancer patients with VTE are at increased risk of developing recurrent VTE compared to patients without cancer, but also have a higher risk of major bleeding. In these patients, low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) have been shown to be more effective and as safe as vitamin K-antagonists (VKAs) for the treatment of VTE. Therefore, the majority of current clinical guidelines recommend LMWHs as the treatment of choice for cancer-associated VTE. However, several issues should be considered regarding the use of LMWHs as daily subcutaneous injections, the costs or risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. In recent years, direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have shown similar efficacy and better safety profile compared to VKAs and have become the standard of care for the treatment of VTE in the general population. Because DOACs offer a simple oral treatment regimen without the need for anticoagulation control, they could be an attractive alternative to LMWH. Before DOACs become an accepted treatment option for cancer associated VTE, they have to be evaluated in a head-to-head comparison with LMWH. Data from two randomized trials comparing DOACs vs. LMWH have recently been published. In the present review, we will provide three clinically relevant questions on the use of DOACs in patients with cancer and VTE and provide an overview on recent evidence on this topic: 1) are DOACs a treatment option for the prevention of VTE in cancer patients?; 2) what is the place for DOACs in patients with cancer-associated VTE?; 3) should I use DOACs for the extended treatment of cancer-related VTE?. © 2019","Cancer; Clinical trials; Direct-acting oral anticoagulants; Venous thromboembolism",Short Survey,Scopus

Piperlongumine (PL), a plant alkaloid, is known to selectively kill tumor cells while sparing normal cells. However, the mechanism of PL-induced cancer cell death is not fully understood. We report here that an association of FOXO3A with the pro-apoptotic protein BIM (also known as BCL2-like 11, BCL2L11) has a direct and specific function in PL-induced cancer cell death. Using HeLa cells stably expressing a FOXO3A-GFP fusion protein and several other cancer cell lines, we found that PL treatment induces FOXO3A dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation and promotes its binding to the BIM gene promoter, resulting in the up-regulation of BIM in the cancer cell lines. Accordingly, PL inhibited cell viability and caused intrinsic apoptosis in a FOXO3A-dependent manner. Of note, siRNA-mediated FOXO3A knockdown rescued the cells from PL-induced cell death. In vivo, the PL treatment markedly inhibited xenograft tumor growth, and this inhibition was accompanied by the activation of the FOXO3A-BIM axis. Moreover, PL promoted FOXO3A dephosphorylation by inhibiting phosphorylation and activation of Akt, a kinase that phosphorylates FOXO3A. In summary, our findings indicate that PL activates the FOXO3A-BIM apoptotic axis by promoting dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of FOXO3A via Akt signaling inhibition. These findings uncover a critical mechanism underlying the effects of PL on cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Akt; Apoptosis; BIM; Cancer cells; FOXO3A; Piperlongumine",Article,Scopus

Due to cancer cell plasticity, the stem-like phenotype can be also acquired by cancer cells refractory to treatment with cytotoxic drugs. We investigated whether drugs inhibiting receptor tyrosine kinases could be used to target human colon cancer cells initiating cancer regrowth following conventional cytotoxic treatment. The moderately differentiated cell line HT-29 and poorly differentiated cell line HCT-116 were exposed to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Cells that resisted the exposure to 5-FU were subsequently treated with imatinib or sunitinib. Both drugs reduced clonogenicity of 5-FU-refractory cells under normoxic and hypoxic culture conditions. The expression of numerous stemness-related genes was upregulated in cancer cells following the exposure to 5-FU, and remained at a high level in 5-FU-refractory cells undergoing renewal under normoxia, but decreased spontaneously under hypoxia. Imatinib downregulated the expression of stemness-related genes in cells undergoing renewal under normoxia. A combination of imatinib with PRI-2191, an analogue of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 , downregulated stemness-related genes in HCT-116/5-FU cells more efficiently than imatinib alone. A synthetic analogue of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 2 (PRI-1906) abolished the effect of imatinib on gene expression in HCT-116/5-FU cells undergoing renewal under normoxia. Sunitinib promoted shift of phenotype of HT-29/5-FU cells undergoing renewal toward stem-like one. It suggests that the phenotype shift toward stemness induced by sequential sunitinib treatment following 5-FU treatment could increase a risk of cancer recurrence. In contrast to sunitinib, imatinib could be used both to interfere with cancer regrowth after conventional chemotherapy and to downregulate the expression of stemness-related genes in residual colon cancer cells capable to initiate cancer recurrence. The findings suggest that imatinib could also be combined with vitamin D analogue PRI-2191 to prevent recurrence more efficiently than imatinib alone and to compensate for vitamin D deficiency resulting from imatinib treatment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cancer stem cells; Colorectal cancer; Imatinib; PRI-1906; PRI-2191; Vitamin D analogues",Article,Scopus

A quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) was used to compute boundaries based on sensitivity and specificity. We analyzed 49 oral cancer lesions, 34 precancerous lesions, and 77 healthy oral mucosae. A boundary (sensitivity: 0.974 and specificity: 0.898) between the oral cancer lesions and healthy oral mucosae was validated. Oral cancer and precancerous lesions were also differentiated from healthy oral mucosae (sensitivity: 0.919 and specificity: 0.755). The two-channel autofluorescence detection device and analyses of the intensity and heterogeneity of NADH, and of FAD, and the redox ratio combined with a QDA classifier can differentiate oral cancer and precancerous lesions from healthy oral mucosae. © 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","autofluorescence; cancer detection; oral cancer; redox ratio",Article,Scopus

Accurate and early detection of breast cancer can ensure long-term surviving for the patients. However, traditional classification algorithms usually aim only to maximize the classification accuracy, failing to take into consideration the misclassification costs between different categories. Furthermore, the costs associated with missing a cancer case (false negative) are clearly much higher than those of mislabeling a benign one (false positive). To overcome this drawback and further improving the classification accuracy of the breast cancer diagnosis, in this work, a novel breast cancer intelligent diagnosis approach has been proposed, which employed information gain directed simulated annealing genetic algorithm wrapper (IGSAGAW) for feature selection, in this process, we performs the ranking of features according to IG algorithm, and extracting the top m optimal feature utilized the cost sensitive support vector machine (CSSVM) learning algorithm. Our proposed feature selection approach which can not only help to reduce the complexity of SAGASW algorithm and effectively extracting the optimal feature subset to a certain extent, but it can also obtain the maximum classification accuracy and minimum misclassification cost. The efficacy of our proposed approach is tested on Wisconsin Original Breast Cancer (WBC) and Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) breast cancer data sets, and the results demonstrate that our proposed hybrid algorithm outperforms other comparison methods. The main objective of this study was to apply our research in real clinical diagnostic system and thereby assist clinical physicians in making correct and effective decisions in the future. Moreover our proposed method could also be applied to other illness diagnosis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Breast cancer diagnosis; Cost-sensitive learning; Genetic algorithm; Information gain; Support vector machine",Article,Scopus

In this study, we examined if ZFP57 is involved in colorectal cancer metastasis. Materials and methods: First, we used colorectal cancer cell lines to perform in vivo metastatic experiments with nude mice. Next, we carried out immunohistochemical analysis of clinical specimens of colorectal cancers. Results: In liver metastatic experiments using human colorectal cancer HT29 and HCT116 cells, liver polymetastases occurred at high frequency in ZFP57-overexpressing HT29 and HCT116 cells, whereas both control cells only resulted in oligometastases. Next, we analyzed ZFP57 expression using clinical specimens. Liver metastasis-positive cases were more frequently associated with ZFP57 overexpression than negative cases in primary lesions of colorectal cancer, and the overexpression was particularly remarkable in tumor invasive lesions. Furthermore, ZFP57 overexpression was significantly correlated not only with liver metastasis but also with lymph node metastasis. In addition, the expression level of ZFP57 was significantly correlated with that of the metastasis-related gene NANOG. We also found that ZFP57 overexpression reduced the progression-free survival rate of patients with colorectal cancer.

Unfortunately, standard treatments using chemotherapy often do not effectively control cancer progression or prevent relapse. Over the past decades, the development of targeted therapies has substantially improved outcomes. Recently, immunotherapy has emerged as a new alternative for more effective cancer treatment and may even bring hope of a cure. Cancer immunotherapy functions by reinforcing a patient's immune defense system to fight the disease. Clinically, promising immunotherapy approaches have, however, been limited by unpredictable response and strong adverse effects. A drug delivery system (DDS) that effectively targets tumor and reduces drug exposure to normal tissue would mitigate these limitations. In this regard, nanotechnology has been intensively studied as a DDS for targeting tumors with various oncologic drugs. Several have resulted in improved treatment and outcome. Research has shown that nanoparticle drug delivery technologies can also be applied to immunotherapy. In this review, the current state of nanotechnology will be discussed. Because most cancer immunotherapies approved in recent years are protein drugs, this article will focus on a micellar nanocomplex (MNC) technology, a DDS platform especially suited for targeted delivery of these therapeutics to solid tumors. © 2019","Cancer; Drug delivery; EGCG; Flavonoid; Immunotherapy; Micellar nanocomplex; Nanomedicine; Nanoparticle; Nanotechnology",Review,Scopus

Underlying much of the instability in cancer is DNA replication stress, which causes both chromosome structural changes and single base-pair mutations. Common fragile sites are some of the earliest and most frequently altered loci in tumors. Notably, the fragile locus, FRA3B, lies within the fragile histidine triad (FHIT) gene, and consequently deletions within FHIT are common in cancer. We review the evidence in support of FHIT as a DNA caretaker and discuss the mechanism by which FHIT promotes genome stability. FHIT increases thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) translation to balance the deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) for efficient DNA replication. Consequently, FHIT-loss causes replication stress, DNA breaks, aneuploidy, copy-number changes (CNCs), small insertions and deletions, and point mutations. Moreover, FHIT-loss-induced replication stress and DNA breaks cooperate with APOBEC3B overexpression to catalyze DNA hypermutation in cancer, as APOBEC family enzymes prefer single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as substrates and ssDNA is enriched at sites of both replication stress and DNA breaks. Consistent with the frequent loss of FHIT across a broad spectrum of cancer types, FHIT-deficiency is highly associated with the ubiquitous, clock-like mutation signature 5 occurring in all cancer types thus far examined. The ongoing destabilization of the genome caused by FHIT loss underlies recurrent inactivation of tumor suppressors and activation of oncogenes. Considering that more than 50% of cancers are FHIT-deficient, we propose that FRA3B/FHIT fragility shapes the mutational landscape of cancer genomes. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","common fragile sites; dNTP pools; FHIT; genome instability; mutational signature; replication stress",Review,Scopus

While the physiological intracellular functions are well described, the mechanism of potential pharmacological effects on cancer cell proliferation is still controversial. There are numerous studies demonstrating that a high InsP 6 concentration (≥75 µM) inhibits growth of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Thus, there is no doubt that InsP 6 exhibits anticancer activity but the mechanism underlying the cellular effects of extracellular InsP 6 on cancer cells is far from being understood. In addition, studies on the inhibitory effect of InsP 6 on cancer progression in animal models ignore aspects of its bioavailability. Here, we review and critically discuss the uptake mechanism and the intracellular involvement in signaling pathways of InsP 6 in cancer cells. We take into account the controversial findings on InsP 6 plasma concentration, which is a critical aspect of pharmacological accessibility of InsP 6 for cancer treatment. Further, we discuss novel findings with respect to the effect of InsP 6 on normal and immune cells as well as on platelet aggregate size.

Actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 2 (ARPC2) was identified as a molecular target of Benp by affinity column chromatography with Benp-tagged Sepharose beads. Benp bound directly to ARPC2 in cells, which was validated by pull-down assay using Benp-biotin and label-free biochemical methods such as the drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA).

Initially, the liver was separated using marker controlled watershed segmentation process and finally the cancer affected lesion was segmented using the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) algorithm. After tumor segmentation, various texture features were extracted from the segmented region. These segmented features were fed to deep neural network (DNN) classifier for automated classification of three types of liver cancer i.e. hemangioma (HEM), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metastatic carcinoma (MET). Results: We have achieved a classification accuracy of 99.38%, Jaccard index of 98.18%, at 200 epochs using DNN classifier with a negligible validation loss of 0.062 during the classification process. Conclusions: Our developed system is ready to be tested with huge database and can aid the radiologist in detecting the liver cancer using CT images. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","CT scan; DNN model; Gaussian mixture model; Liver cancer; Watershed transform",Article,Scopus

Many BC susceptibility genes can be grouped into two classes, high- and low-penetrance genes, each of which interact with multiple genes and environmental factors. However, the penetrance of genes can also be represented by a spectrum, which ranges between high and low. Two of the most common susceptibility genes are BRCA1 and BRCA2, which perform vital cellular functions for repair of homologous DNA. Loss of heterozygosity accompanied by hereditary mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 increases chromosomal instability and the likelihood of cancer, as well as playing a key role in stimulating malignant transformation. With regard to pathological features, familial breast cancers caused by BRCA1 mutations usually differ from those caused by BRCA2 mutations and nonfamilial BCs. It is essential to acquire an understanding of these pathological features along with the genetic history of the patient to offer an individualized treatment. Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are the main genetic and inherited factors for breast and ovarian cancer. In fact, these mutations are very important in developing early onset and increasing the risk of familial breast and ovarian cancer and responsible for 90% of hereditary BC cases. Therefore, according to the conducted studies, screening of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes is recommended as an important marker for early detection of all patients with breast or ovarian cancer risk with family history of the disease. In this review, we summarize the role of hereditary genes, mainly BRCA1 and BRCA2, in BC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","BRCA; breast cancer; germline mutations; hereditary genes",Review,Scopus

However, the landscape of fusion transcripts in bladder cancer has not been fully characterized. Methods: To identify fusion transcripts with potential therapeutic or diagnostic values, TCGA bladder urothelial carcinoma RNA-sequencing dataset was used. In order to avoid false positives, we applied multiple criteria including filtering out fusions detected in normal samples from GTEx dataset. We validated a subset of candidate fusions with a collection of bladder cancer and adjacent normal samples. Result: We identified 19,547 high confidence fusion genes from 414 bladder cancer samples. After filtering off M/M fusions, fusions in GTEx normal samples, and occurrence frequency <5, we obtained a list of 271 gene fusions, 13 of which were novel and specific to cancer samples. Six of those fusions were validated using cell lines and clinical samples. We discovered that two chimeric RNAs, BCL2L2-PABPN1 and CHFR-GOLGA3, were detected to be expressed significantly higher in bladder cancer samples compared to adjacent normal samples. Impressively, the wild-type of the parental genes were not differentially expressed. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that these two fusions are generated by cis-splicing between adjacent genes. These two fusions were detected mainly in the fraction of cell nucleus, suggesting a potential long noncoding RNA role. Conclusion: Our findings provide a panoramic view of the landscape of chimeric RNAs in bladder cancer. Some frequent chimeric RNAs are generated by intergenic splicing, and represent a new repertoire for potential biomarkers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bladder cancer; Chimeric RNAs; cis-SAGe; Gene fusion; Intergenic splicing",Article,Scopus

However, many groups of patients were either excluded from or underrepresented in the clinical trials that form the evidence base for this recommendation. This study aims to determine whether using administrative health care data—real world data—and econometric methods for causal analysis to provide “real world evidence” (RWE) are feasible methods for addressing this gap. Methods: Cases of primary breast cancer in women from 2001 to 2015 were extracted from the Scottish cancer registry (SMR06) and linked to other routine health records (inpatient and outpatient visits). Four methods were used to estimate the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on disease-specific and overall mortality: (1) regression with adjustment for covariates, (2) propensity score matching, (3) instrumental variables analysis, and (4) regression discontinuity design. Hazard ratios for breast cancer mortality and all-cause mortality were compared to those from a meta-analysis of randomized trials. Results: A total of 39,805 cases were included in the analyses. Regression adjustment, propensity score matching, and instrumental variables were feasible, whereas regression discontinuity was not. Effectiveness estimates were similar between RWE and randomized trials for breast cancer mortality but not for all-cause mortality. Conclusions: RWE methods are a feasible means to generate estimates of effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy in early stage breast cancer. However, such estimates must be interpreted in the context of the available randomized evidence and the potential biases of the observational methods. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Adjuvant chemotherapy; Breast cancer; Feasibility; Instrumental variables; Meta-analysis; Propensity score; Real world evidence; Regression discontinuity",Article,Scopus

Ribophorin II (RPN2) has emerged as a vital regulator of MDR in multiple cancers including gastric cancer (GC). However, the roles and molecular mechanisms of RPN2 in MDR have not been well featured till now. The present study aimed to explore the roles and molecular mechanisms of RPN2 in MDR of drug-resistant GC cells. Results showed that the expressions of RPN2, multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1), and ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) were upregulated in SGC7901/DDP and SGC7901/VCR cells. Knockdown of RPN2 alleviated MDR through downregulating MDR1 and ABCG2 expressions in SGC7901/DDP and SGC7901/VCR cells. RPN2 depletion inhibited the activation of MEK/ERK pathway. RPN2 overexpression enhanced MDR by upregulating P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and ABCG2 protein expressions in SGC7901/DDP or SGC7901/VCR cells, while this effect of RPN2 was abrogated by ERK knockdown or treatment with ERK inhibitor PD98059.

Recently, media treated with CAP have also found to effectively eradicate cancer cells similar to the CAP. Based on advantages, many researchers prefer to apply CAP-activated media (PAM) as an alternative to cap in the treatment of cancer. However, less has been achieved regarding the anticancer effects and anticancer mechanisms of PAM. Investigating the selective anticancerous activities of PAM, the viability of SKBR3, MCF7, ASPC-1, A-549, G-292, and SW742 cancer cell lines, as well as normal human skin fibroblasts (FMGB-1) and MCF10A cells in relation to the media activation time, and the length of exposure was studied. Also, we examined the concentration of ozone in media as a function to CAP activation time since recent studies have proposed ozone as a pivotal reactive species in the induction of cell death. Based on the result, both increasing the duration of media activation time and the length of exposure to PAM could significantly increase the anticancer activity. Nevertheless, the cytotoxicity on normal cells was either not affected or slightly increased. Among the six tested cancer cell lines, SW742 was the most resistant and SKBR3 the most susceptible cancer cell lines to PAM. Also, increasing duration of treatment with CAP resulted in a significant rise in O 3 concentration levels in media. Overall, these results suggest PAM, as a promising tool in the treatment of different cancers and O 3 formation as a probable underlying mechanism. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","CAP-activated media; cell viability; cold atmospheric plasma; ozone",Article,Scopus

Objectives: We investigated the relationship between drinking water exposures and incident colorectal cancers in a cohort of postmenopausal women. Methods: Using historical nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 -N) measurements and estimates of total trihalomethanes (TTHM), the sum of 5 or 6 haloacetic acids (HAAs), and individual DBPs in public water supplies (PWS), we computed average exposures and years of exposure above one-half the U.S. maximum contaminant level (&gt;1/2-MCL; &gt;5 mg/L NO 3 -N and &gt;40 μg/L TTHM). Nitrate/nitrite intakes from dietary sources were estimated using a food frequency questionnaire. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from Cox regression models. We assessed NO 3 -N interactions with DBPs and with factors influencing endogenous NOC formation. Results: We identified 624 colon and 158 rectal cancers (1986–2010) among 15,910 women reporting PWS use &gt;10 years. Ingestion of NO 3 -N from drinking water was not associated with risk. Colon cancer risks were non-significantly associated with the average TTHM levels &gt;17.7 μg/L (HR Q5vsQ1 = 1.13, CI = 0.89–1.44; p trend = 0.11) and were elevated for any duration of exposure &gt;1/2-MCL. Rectal cancer risks were associated with the highest TTHM levels (HR Q5vsQ1 = 1.71, CI = 1.00–2.92; p trend = 0.22) but not with years &gt;1/2-MCL. Bromodichloromethane (HR Q4vsQ1 = 1.89, CI = 1.17–3.00; p trend = 0.09) and trichloroacetic acid (HR Q4vsQ1 = 1.92, CI = 1.20–3.09; p trend = 0.18) levels were also associated with risk of rectal cancer. We found no evidence of interaction between TTHM and NO 3 -N on the risk of either cancer. Dietary analyses yielded a positive colon cancer association with red meat, but not with processed meat intake or estimated nitrate/nitrite from specific dietary sources. Conclusions: Our results suggest that exposure to TTHM in drinking water is associated with increased risk of rectal cancer. Positive findings for individual THMs and HAAs for both colon and rectal cancers require replication in other studies.

Recently, evidences show that BAG3 promotes stemness of human cancer cells. IFN-stimulated genes 15 (ISG15) is an ubiquitin-like molecule, which is covalently conjugated with substrates to form ISGylated proteins. Global screening BAG3 interacting partners demonstrated that ISG15 might be a potential binding partner. The current study revealed that BAG3 did not interact with ISG15, but positively regulated ISG15 expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (PDAC). It was further found that BAG3 deletion stabilized ISG15 mRNAs, while suppressed its translation via increasing Serine phosphorylation of Ago2 at position 387 (S387). Both BAG3 deletion and ISG15 knockdown suppressed stem cell-like phenotypes of PDAC cells, including clonogenicity, invasiveness and spheroid formation. In addition, ectopic ISG15 expression rescued the suppressive role of BAG3 deletion in cancer stem cell (CSC)-like phenotypes of PDAC cells, and this effect of ISG15 was independent of its ISGylation function.

Nontoxic herbal medicines are therefore considered as a favorable alternative. Astragalus membranaceus has attracted growing interest in the field of biomedicine thanks to its various biological activities, among which the anticancer activity is considered to be closely associated with its active component-astragalus polysaccharide (APS). Currently, direct anti-tumor activity and the activation of immune response of the host have been widely acknowledged as the mechanism by which APS exerts its anti-cancer activity. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether APS could inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells and activate macrophages to further kill cancer cells. The results indicated that the obtained APS was a pyran-type polysaccharide, containing 89.75% total carbohydrate and a minor amount of uronic acid (9.3%). Although APS did not significantly inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells growth, encouragingly, APS-activated RAW264.7 macrophages present anti-cancer activity as evidenced by (a) cell proliferation inhibition (with an inhibitory rate of 41%), (b) G1-phase cell cycle arrest, as well as (c) the regulation of apoptosis-related genes (Bax/Bcl-2, 13.26-fold increase than untreated cells). In addition, APS could upregulate the level of nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which acted as inducers of tumor cell apoptosis. Collectively, our findings suggest that APS can activate macrophages to release NO and TNF-α which directly blocks cancer cell growth. The anti-breast cancer effect of APS and the in vivo mechanism will be further elucidated with a review to provide a therapeutic strategy for breast cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Apoptosis; Astragalus polysaccharides; Breast cancer; Macrophage activation; TNF-α",Article,Scopus

However, long term use of high dose progestin often lead to progestin resistance. Our previous studies have demonstrated that metformin reversed progestin resistance through the downregulation of the expression of glyoxalase I (GLOI) in type I endometrial cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated the role of Ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1) in endometrial cancer, but the physiological role of TET1 in GLOI-mediated progestin resistance has been poorly addressed. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of TET1, GLOI and 5hmC in various endometrium. Western blot was carried out to analyses TET1 and GLOI expression with different treatment. Cell counting kit-8 was used to evaluate cell proliferation after various treatment. Dot blot assay and HMeDIP assay were performed to detect global hydroxmethylation levels and hydroxymethylation levels in GLOI gene respectively. In current study, we found that metformin effectively sensitized progestin in endometrial cancer cell lines through the down regulation of the expression of TET1 and GLOI. Interestingly, the exogenous increase of TET1 expression enhanced total 5hmC level and hydroxymethylation modification in glyoxalase I promoter region. This effect was abated by metformin treatment. Moreover, the expression profile of TET1 and glyoxalase I in various endometrial tissue parallelized with 5hmC level.

It also contributes to the maintenance of cellular functions, such as Ca 2+ storage, lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and organelle biogenesis. Cellular stress conditions, such as glucose deprivation, hypoxia and disturbance of Ca 2+ homeostasis, may increase the risk of protein misfolding and perturb proteostasis. This activates ER stress and triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), leading to either the restoration of homeostasis or cell death. ER stress and UPR have been shown to play crucial roles in the pathogenesis, progression and treatment response of various cancers. In gastric cancer (GC), one of the most aggressive cancer types, critical functions of ER stress signaling have also started to emerge.

However, intracellular delivery of siRNA is challenging. We used bovine milk exosomes as a novel system for siRNA delivery. First, we demonstrated that exosomes can deliver endogenous RNA payloads into recipient cells. Next, we loaded siRNA against specific genes including VEGF, EGFR, AKT, MAPK, and KRAS. We utilized 5′ −32 P-labeled siKRAS as a tracer and found exosome loading with siRNA could be variable. We demonstrated that the siRNA of loaded exosomes is stable and resist degradation. Our results indicated that siRNAs against target genes ranged from 2 to 10-fold knockdown in expression levels in various cancers. Since mutated KRAS has been implicated in the development of various cancers including lung cancer, we tested a mutant-allele specific siRNA against KRAS G12S , in A549 cells. We observed a dose-dependent anti-proliferative activity against A549 cells treated with exosomes carrying siKRAS G12S . We observed significant inhibition of A549 tumor xenografts in animals treated with folic acid-functionalized exosomes carrying siKRAS.

By proteomic analysis and proximity ligation assays, we found that proNGF binding to sortilin induced sequential formation of the functional sortilin/TrkA/EphA2 complex, leading to TrkA-phosphorylation dependent Akt activation and EphA2-dependent Src activation. EphA2 inhibition using siRNA approach abolished proNGF-stimulated clonogenic growth of breast cancer cell lines. Combinatorial targeting of TrkA and EphA2 dramatically reduced colony formation in vitro, primary tumor growth and metastatic dissemination towards the brain in vivo. Finally, proximity ligation assay in breast tumor samples revealed that increased TrkA/EphA2 proximity ligation assay signals were correlated with a decrease of overall survival in patients.

We now report that NFX1-123 is highly expressed in primary cervical cancers. In vitro, cells expressing 16E6 and overexpressing NFX1-123 have extended active growth, decreased senescence marker staining, and more rapid cell cycling compared to 16E6 expressing cells with endogenous amounts of NFX1-123. These findings were associated with increased telomerase activity and augmented expression of its catalytic subunit, hTERT. In complement, HPV 16 positive cervical cancer cell lines with knocked down NFX1-123 had slowed growth and reduced hTERT over time. In cells that express HR HPV E6, greater expression of NFX1-123 can modify active cellular growth and augment hTERT expression and telomerase activity over time, potentially supporting the initiation and progression of HPV-associated cancers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Growth; HR E6; HR HPV; NFX1-123; Telomerase",Article,Scopus

This reality highlights the importance of developing novel therapeutic approaches. In this field, multifunctional nanomedicines have the potential to revolutionize the currently available treatments. These unique nanodevices can simultaneously act as therapeutic and imaging agents allowing the real-time monitoring of the nanoparticles biodistribution and the treatment outcome. Among the different nanoparticles, the gold-core silica shell (AuMSS) nanoparticles advantageous physicochemical and biological properties make them promising nanoplatforms for cancer therapy. Nevertheless, their successful application as an effective cancer nanomedicine is limited by the unfavorable pharmacokinetics and uncontrolled release of the therapeutic payloads. Herein, a new polymeric coating for AuMSS nanospheres was developed by combining different ratios (25/75, 50/50 and 75/25) of two materials, Poly-2-ethyl-2-oxazoline (PEOZ) and β-cyclodextrin (β-CD). The surface functionalization of AuMSS nanospheres led to a size increase and to the neutralization of the surface charge. On the other side, the nanoparticles biological performance was improved. The coated AuMSS nanospheres showed an increased cytocompatibility and internalization rate by the HeLa cancer cells.

Several lines of evidence suggest that carcinogenesis is a complex process that is initiated by DNA damage. Exposure to clastogenic agents such as heavy metals, ionizing radiation (IR), and chemotherapy drugs may cause chronic mutations in the genomic material, leading to a phenomenon named genomic instability. Evidence suggests that genomic instability is responsible for cancer incidence after exposure to carcinogenic agents, and increases the risk of secondary cancers following treatment with radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Melatonin as the main product of the pineal gland is a promising hormone for preventing cancer and improving cancer treatment. Melatonin can directly neutralize toxic free radicals more efficiently compared with other classical antioxidants. In addition, melatonin is able to regulate the reduction/oxidation (redox) system in stress conditions. Through regulation of mitochondrial nction and inhibition of pro-oxidant enzymes, melatonin suppresses chronic oxidative stress. Moreover, melatonin potently stimulates DNA damage responses that increase the tolerance of normal tissues to toxic effect of IR and may reduce the risk of genomic instability in patients who undergo radiotherapy. Through these mechanisms, melatonin attenuates several side effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Interestingly, melatonin has shown some synergistic properties with IR and chemotherapy, which is distinct from classical antioxidants that are mainly used for the alleviation of adverse events of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

Discovering few genes relevant to one cancer disease can result in effective treatments. The challenge associated with the Microarray datasets is its high dimensionality; the huge number of features compared to the modest number of samples in these datasets. Recent research efforts attempted to reduce this high-dimensionality using different feature selection techniques. This paper presents an ensemble feature selection technique based on t-test and genetic algorithm. After preprocessing the data using t-test, a Nested Genetic Algorithm, namely Nested-GA, is used to get the optimal subset of features by combining data from two different datasets. Nested-GA consists of two Nested Genetic Algorithms (outer and inner) that run on two different kinds of datasets. The Outer Genetic Algorithm (OGA-SVM) works on Microarray gene expression datasets, whereas the Inner Genetic Algorithm (IGA-NNW) runs on DNA Methylation datasets. Nested-GA is performed on a colon cancer dataset with 5-fold cross validation. After applying Nested-GA, the Incremental Feature Selection (IFS) strategy is used to get the smallest optimal genes subset. The genes subset has been validated on an independent dataset resulting in 99.9% classification accuracy. Consequently, the biological significance of the resulting optimal genes is validated using Enrichment Analysis. Moreover, the results of Nested-GA have been compared to the results of other feature selection algorithms that have been run on either Gene Expression or DNA Methylation datasets. From the experimental results, Nested-GA showed the highest classification performance with a small optimal feature subset compared to the other algorithms. Furthermore, by running Nested-GA on lung cancer datasets that contain two different cancer subtypes, it resulted in significantly better classification accuracy (98.4%) compared to the accuracy of a previous research (84.6%) that utilized lung cancer DNA-Methylation data only. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Colon cancer; DNA Methylation; Feature selection; Genetic algorithm; Lung cancer; Machine learning; Microarray gene expression; Support Vector Machine",Article,Scopus

This study aimed to investigate the effect of MALAT1 on the proliferation, migration, and drug sensitivity of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo and the mechanisms involved therein. We observed increased expression of MALAT1 in six CRC cell lines compared to that in normal cells, suggesting its involvement in CRC progression. Downregulation of MALAT1 inhibited cell migration and induced apoptosis in vitro and inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice. Furthermore, MALAT1 silencing downregulated the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multi-drug resistance proteins including MDR1 and MRP1, resulting in decreased resistance of cancer cells to 5-FU. In addition, the metastasis and invasion of HCT-116 and HCT-116/5-FU cells were regulated via targeting miR-20b-5p.

Some economic analyses have carried out various methods to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab as the first-line treatment for NSCLC in other countries. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone for the first-line treatment of advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. Methods: A Markov model was applied from the perspective of the Chinese health care system to assess cost-effectiveness. It was based on the clinical trial BEYOND that compared bevacizumab plus carboplatin/paclitaxel (B+CP) with placebo plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (PI+CP) for advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. Ten-year quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed. Results: QALYs were 1.17 years in the B+CP group and 0.83 years in the PI+CP group, resulting in a difference of 0.34 years. The ICER was $130,937.09/QALY, which was far beyond the willing-to-pay threshold of $24,314/QALY. At a threshold of $130,584/QALY, addition of bevacizumab had a 50% probability of being cost-effective. Conclusions: Bevacizumab is not cost-effective when combined with chemotherapy for patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC based on the Chinese health care system, resulting in a less demand in the Chinese market. © 2018","bevacizumab; chemotherapy; cost-effectiveness; non–small-cell lung cancer",Article,Scopus

The NPs were loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) and indocyanine green (ICG) for dual modality cancer treatment and coated with cholesterol-PEG (C-PEG) for MDR abrogation in treatment of human MDR breast cancer. The in vitro cellular uptake of the DOX/ICG loaded nanoparticles (DI-NPs) by MDR cancer cells was significantly enhanced owing to effective inhibition of the P-gp activity by C-PEG and γ-PGA receptor-mediated endocytosis. DOX localization in cytoplasm and nucleus was observed particularly with the photo-thermal effect that facilitated intracellular drug release. As a result, the C-PEG coated DI-NPs after photo-irradiation exhibited a synergistic effect of combination (chemo/thermal) therapy to depress the proliferation of MDR cancer calls. The ex vivo biodistribution study revealed an enhanced tumor accumulation of C-PEG (2000) coated DI-NPs in MCF-7/MDR tumor-bearing nude mice due to the excellent EPR effects by the NP surface PEGylation.

This prospective, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial investigated two intensification regimens. cT4 lesions were excluded. Primary objective: pathological outcome (TRG 1-2) among arms. Materials and methods: Low-located cT2N0–2M0, cT3N0–2M0 (up to 12 cm from anal verge) presentations were treated with cbRCT randomly intensified by either radiotherapy boost (Xelac arm) or multidrug concomitant chemotherapy (Xelox arm). Xelac: concomitant boost to bulky site (45 Gy/1.8 Gy/die, 5 sessions/week to the pelvis, +10 Gy at 1 Gy twice/week to the bulky) plus concurrent capecitabine (1650 mg/mq/die). Xelox: 45 Gy to the pelvis + 5.4 Gy/1.8 Gy/die, 5 sessions/week to the bulky site + concurrent capecitabine (1300 mg/mq/die) and oxaliplatin (130 mg/mq on days 1,19,38). Surgery was planned 7–9 weeks after radiochemotherapy. Results: From June 2005 to September 2013, 534 patients were analysed: 280 in Xelac, 254 in Xelox arm. Xelox arm presented higher G ≥ 3 haematologic (p = 0.01) and neurologic toxicity (p < 0.001). Overall, 98.5% patients received curative surgery. The tumour regression grade distribution did not differ between arms (p = 0.102). TRG 1+2 rate significantly differed: Xelac arm 61.7% vs. Xelox 52.3% (p = 0.039). Pathological complete response (ypT0N0) rates were 24.4 and 23.8%, respectively (p non-significant). Median follow-up:5.62 years. Five-year disease-free survival rate were 74.7% (Xelac) and 73.8% (Xelox), respectively (p = 0.444). Five-year overall survival rate were 80.4% (Xelac) and 85.5% (Xelox), respectively (p = 0.155). Conclusion: Xelac arm significantly obtained higher TRG1-2 rates. No differences were found about clinical outcome. Because of efficacy on TRG, inferior toxicity and good compliance, Xelac schedules or similar radiotherapy dose intensification schemes could be considered as reference treatments for cT3 lesions. © 2018","Boost; Chemoradiation; Oxaliplatin; Pathologic complete response; Preoperative radiochemotherapy; Rectal cancer",Article,Scopus

Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is a major protein of caveolae, which participates in various cellular functions, such as vesicle trafficking, cholesterol homeostasis, tumor progression, etc. In the present study, we investigated a role for Cav-1 in regulating the stemness of human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells. Cav-1 expression was significantly lower in tumorspheres than in adherent cells. The silencing of Cav-1 enhanced stemness of MDA-MB-231 cells. Mechanistically, Cav-1 silencing was accompanied by enhanced expression of Bmi-1, which is a representative self-renewal regulator, and promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In a CSC-like state, reduced Cav-1 depends on its destabilization through ubiquitin-proteasome degradation. We further found that Src-mediated phosphorylation of Cav-1 at the Tyr 14 residue is essential for its degradation. Taken together, these findings suggest that Cav-1 destabilization by Src may play a pivotal role in manifestation and maintenance of stemness in breast cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Breast cancer stem cell; c-Src; Caveolin-1; Destabilization; Phosphorylation",Article,Scopus

LncRNA DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 5 (DGCR5) has been proven to be involved in lung cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the function of DGCR5 in BCa remains largely unknown. Here, we found that DGCR5 expression was significantly downregulated in BCa tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Higher expression of DGCR5 predicted higher survival rate in BCa patients. Functional experiments indicated that DGCR5 overexpression markedly inhibited that proliferation, colony formation, and cell-cycle progression in BCa cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of DGCR5 led to decreased BCa cell migration, invasion, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition while promoting apoptosis. In vivo xenograft assay also illustrated that DGCR5 overexpression inhibited BCa growth. In the mechanism, we found that DGCR5 interacted with AT-rich interaction domain 1A (ARID1A), a chromatin remodeling protein, to promote P21 transcription. Knockdown of P21 could significantly rescue the suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion of BCa cells by DGCR5 overexpression. In summary, our study demonstrated that DGCR5 transcriptionally promotes P21 expression to suppress BCa progression. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","bladder cancer; DGCR5; long noncoding RNA; progression",Article,Scopus

The Sequenom's MassARRAY ® genotyping platform was used to genotype the polymorphisms, and infection of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) was determined by using a commercial H. pylori immunogold testing kit. The results showed that IL-17A rs3748067 T allele carriers have a higher gastric cancer risk than non-carriers in the subgroup of individuals with age &gt;64 years old (CT/TT vs. CC: adjusted OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.04–2.29).

Methods: From April 2014 to June 2015, 124 women with dense breasts and intermediate to high breast cancer risk were recruited for screening with FFDM, DBT, and ABUS. Readers used FFDM and DBT in clinical practice and received ABUS training prior to study initiation. FFDM or DBT were first interpreted alone by two independent readers and then with ABUS. All recalled women underwent diagnostic workup with at least one year of follow-up. Recall rates were compared using the sign test; differences in outcomes were evaluated using Fisher's exact test. Results: Of 121 women with complete follow-up, all had family (35.5%) or personal (20.7%) history of breast cancer, or both (43.8%). Twenty-four women (19.8%) were recalled by at least one modality. Recalls increased from 5.0% to 13.2% (p = 0.002) when ABUS was added to FFDM and from 3.3% to 10.7% (p = 0.004) when ABUS was added to DBT. Findings recalled by both readers were more likely to result in a recommendation for short term follow-up imaging or tissue biopsy compared to findings recalled by only one reader (100% vs. 42.1%, p = 0.041). The cancer detection rate was 8.3 per 1000 screens (1/121); mode of detection: FFDM and DBT. Conclusions: Adding ABUS significantly increased the recall rate of both FFDM and DBT screening.

In this study, a rapid and sensitive fluorescent immunochromatographic test strip with a miniature analytical device (20.0 cm × 18.9 cm × 11.2 cm, 2.4 kg) was developed for the simultaneous determination of PG I and PG II in one sample in a single assay, which is promisingly suitable for the mass screening of gastric cancer. Under the optimum conditions, PG I and PG II concentrations as low as 2.6 ng/mL and 1.0 ng/mL could be detected in 15 min with only 7.5 μL plasma specimen, and no cross-reactivity was observed. The detection range was linear over 10.0–210.0 ng/mL for PG I and 3.0–63.0 ng/mL for PG II. The immunosensor also demonstrated high recoveries (93.6–110.8% for PG I and 95.4–110.4% for PG II) with low coefficient of variation (CV) (4.8–8.1% for PG I and 6.6–11.7% for PG II) when testing actual human plasma. The analyses by the proposed assay correlated well with those by ELISA of 30 spiked samples. The assay was finally applied to 30 clinical samples, and the results showed its clinical significance for the early screening of gastric cancer.

Several studies suggest that the CTRA may also be down-regulated in association with some positive psychological states, particularly eudaimonic well-being. However, it is not clear if the link between inter-individual differences in the CTRA and eudaimonic well-being can be extended to intra-individual change. Using a standardized mindfulness-based intervention, the current study tested whether mindfulness-related increases in eudaimonic well-being related to intra-individual reduction in the CTRA in a sample of younger breast cancer survivors. Methods: Participants were 22 women who had been diagnosed and treated for early-stage breast cancer at or before age 50 (M age = 46.6 years) and had no evidence of active disease. Women completed self-report questionnaires and provided peripheral blood samples before and after a 6-week mindfulness meditation intervention. Regression analyses were used to quantify associations between the magnitude of change in eudaimonic well-being and the magnitude of change in the global CTRA score. Results: Women reported significant increases in eudaimonic well–being and showed decreased expression of the pro-inflammatory subcomponent of the CTRA from pre- to post-intervention. The magnitude of increase in eudaimonic well-being was associated with the magnitude of decrease in the composite CTRA score, and this relationship was driven primarily by increased expression of the antiviral/antibody-related CTRA subcomponent. While the intervention was also associated with reduced depressive symptoms, there was no association between change in depressive symptoms and change in the overall CTRA composite score or either of its subcomponents. Conclusions: Results are consistent with the hypothesis that eudaimonic well-being may be an important mechanism in interventions aimed at enhancing health in vulnerable groups, and contribute to our understanding of how psychological well-being may influence physical health in cancer patients. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cancer; Eudaimonia; Gene expression; Immune system; Mindfulness meditation; Psychoneuroimmunology",Article,Scopus

High levels of EGFR expression in their tumors leads to a poor prognosis and inhibition frequently induces autophagy in cancer cells. This study aimed to investigate whether EGFR inhibition by canertinib induces autophagy and this induction influence the effect of Palladium (Pd) (II) complex and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) especially in nontoxic doses. Methods: Cytotoxicity was evaluated by using SRB assay. Apoptosis, autophagy, and EGFR key markers were determined by flow cytometry, fluorescence staining, and immunoblotting. Colony formation, invasion, and wound healing assays were performed to investigate cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, respectively. Results: Blocking EGFR by the pan-ErbB tyrosine kinase inhibitor canertinib inhibited cell growth of HeLa cervical cancer cells in combination with Pd(II) complex and 5-FU. Combination of canertinib and Pd(II) complex promotes autophagy and apoptosis of HeLa cancer cells via blockade of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathway, which leads to cervical cancer cell death. ROS accumulation and DNA damage were increased after combinatorial treatment which causes depolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane and leads to apoptotic cell death. Canertinib combined with Pd(II) complex leads to inhibition of migration and invasion. Conclusion: Inhibition of EGFR signaling by canertinib in combination with Pd(II) complex promotes apoptosis and autophagy via blockade of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK. General significance: The cytotoxic activity of Pd(II) complex and 5-FU on HeLa cells is mediated by EGFR inhibition and autophagy induction, leading to activation of mitochondrial apoptotic cell death. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Apoptosis; Autophagy; Epidermal growth factor receptor; Mitochondrial depolarization; Tyrosine kinase inhibitors",Article,Scopus

Knockdown of miR-575 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptotic death of MGC-803 cells both in vitro and vivo. PTEN levels (both mRNA and protein) were remarkably decreased in cancer tissues compared with the paired-adjacent tissues, and negatively correlated with miR-575 in the tissues. By using luciferase reporter assay, we found PTEN was a direct downstream target of miR-575, and negatively regulated by miR-575 via targeting its 3′UTR. Knockdown or overexpression of miR-575 in MGC-803 cells negatively regulated PTEN expression. Finally, silencing PTEN partially impaired anti-proliferative effects of miR-575 inhibitor. miRNA-575 serves a pivotal role in GC as a cancer promoter gene by targeting PTEN to regulate proliferation and apoptosis of the cancer cells. © 2019 The Authors","Apoptosis; Gastric cancer; microRNA-575; Proliferation; PTEN",Article,Scopus

However, patients with NMOSD presenting with short-segment transverse myelitis (STM) during myelitis attacks associated with breast cancer are uncommon. We report a case of a 35-year-old woman with STM and left eye optic neuritis. The patient was positive for serum aquaporin-4 antibodies (AQP4-IgG), and a biopsy of the left breast showed invasive ductal carcinoma. The patient was diagnosed with NMOSD and breast malignancy. This is the first report of a patient with NMOSD whose spinal MRI showed STM and serum test showed that the patient's AQP4-IgG was positive and complicated by breast cancer. This case improves our understanding of the association between NMOSD and cancer and raises the question of whether it was a coincidental occurrence.

Considering these aspects, in the present investigation, we explore the possible applicability of various CMs in the biofabrication of metal NPs. The synthesis of NPs was primarily followed by UV/VIS spectroscopy, and, thereafter, the NPs were characterized by various physiochemical techniques, including EM, EDX, FT_IR, X-ray diffraction, and DLS measurements, and finally, their anticancer potentialities were investigated against breast cancer. In addition, the NPs were examined in conjunction with artemisinin for therapeutic benefits against aggressive and highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.

The expression levels and mutational profiles of the genes involving in the chromatin were utilized altogether to construct a fusion patient similarity network by similarity network fusion. The genes that were differentially expressed in one clustered group or two were identified. Fifty chromatin-regulating genes had nonsilent mutations in at least 10 patients. KMT2D, KDM6A, CREBBP, ARID1A, and ARID2 had enriched inactivating mutations. Among 399 cases where both the single-nucleotide polymorphism information and the messenger RNA expression profiles were available, 326, 23, and 50 patients were clustered into Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

HA hydrogels could be formed within 120 s. The hydrogels had similar topography and mechanical properties to breast tumor and displayed glutathione and hyaluronidase dual-responsive degradation behavior. Biological studies demonstrated that HA hydrogel could support the proliferation and clustering of breast cancer MCF-7 cells.

This is mediated both by direct cytotoxic mechanisms and by production of immunoregulatory cytokines. Recent evidence has shown that NK cells also display memory, similar to the cells of the adaptive immune system. Cytokines are pivotal for the maturation, activation and survival of NK cells. Interleukins (IL)-2, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-21 and type I interferons positively regulate NK cell function, either independently or in cooperation, whereas other cytokines, such as IL-23 and IL-27, may enhance or suppress NK cell function depending on the context. In the tumor microenvironment, TGFβ, IL-10 and IL-6 suppress NK cell activity not only directly, but also indirectly, by affecting immunosuppressive cells and by antagonizing the effect of stimulatory cytokines, thereby dampening the antitumor response of NK cells and promoting subsequent tumor evasion and progression. Increased understanding of the NK cell response to cytokines has provided a better understanding of their impaired function in tumors which may aid in the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies to enhance NK cell responses in cancer patients. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cytokines; Cytotoxicity; Immunotherapy; NK cells; Tumors",Review,Scopus

The aim of our study was to quantitatively analyze the impact of anatomical interfraction variations on dose to OARs in pancreatic cancer (PC) treated by SBRT using a CyberKnife with integrated CT-on-rails. Materials and methods: Thirty-five PC patients treated with SBRT (40 Gy/5 fractions) underwent a CT-scan in treatment position before each of the first three fractions using the CT-on-rails system. OARs (stomach, duodenum, bowel) were manually delineated and concatenated to one structure (Gastro-Intestinal Organ, GIO). To overlay the planned dose distribution, fiducial-based alignment of the fraction CT with the planning CT was performed. Planned DVH parameters of the OAR were compared to the parameters calculated in the fractions CTs. Results: Compared to the treatment plan, the median V35, D2, D5, D10 and Dmax of the fraction CTs in the GIO was increased by 1.0 (IQR: 0.2–2.6), 4.4% (0.4–10.8), 2.3% (0.2–7.5), 3.3% (−0.4 to 7.1), and 12.0% (5.0–18.9) respectively. Median increase was statistically significant for all parameters in GIO and for V35 in all critical structures at Wilcoxon test.

The drug is also under clinical evaluation for metastatic urothelial cancer and other solid tumors. Preclinical studies from multiple tumor types suggest that other factors also affect the sensitivity of individual tumors to Cdk4/6 inhibitor. We show here that Cdk2 has an essential role in palbociclib antitumor effect against bladder cancers. We found that palbociclib induced apoptosis instead of cell cycle arrest to exhibit its anticancer activity in T24 cells, as was evidenced by membrane blebbing, caspase-3 activation and AIF release from mitochondria. Cdk2 activation was important to palbociclib-induced apoptotic triggering activity, since depletion of Cdk2 significantly inhibited caspase-3 activation and cell apoptosis. Cdk2 activation caused p-Rad9 translocation to the mitochondria and subsequently interaction with Bcl-xl, leading to conformational activation of Bak and cell apoptosis. The anticancer activity and Cdk2 activation of palbociclib-treated mice were finally validated in a T24 xenograft model. Collectively, these results together demonstrate that palbociclib exerts its anticancer effect in T24 cells mainly through Cdk2 activation.

Recent studies have fully established the role of angiogenesis in cancer progression as well as invasion and metastasis. Consequently, many therapeutic agents such as monoclonal antibodies targeting angiogenesis pathway have been introduced in clinic with the hope for improving the outcomes of cancer therapy. Bevacizumab (Avastin®) was the first anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeting monoclonal antibody developed with this purpose and soon received its accelerated US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer in 2008. However, the failure to meet expecting results in different follow-up studies, forced FDA to remove bevacizumab approval for metastatic breast cancer. Investigations have now revealed that while suppressing VEGF pathway initially decreases tumor progression rate and vasculature density, activation of several interrelated pathways and signaling molecules following VEGF blockade compensate the insufficiency of VEGF and initially blocked angiogenesis, explaining in part the failure observed with bevacizumab single therapy. In present review, we introduce some of the main pathways and signaling molecules involved in angiogenesis and then propose how their interconnection may result in development of resistance to bevacizumab. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","angiogenesis; HGF; HIF; MET; VEGF",Review,Scopus

Furthermore, a major gap of knowledge concerns the stability of CFSs during gametogenesis. CFS instability in meiotic or postmeiotic stages of the germ cell line could generate chromosome deletions or large rearrangements. This in turn can lead to the functional loss of the several CFS-associated genes with tumor suppressor function. Our hypothesis is that such mutations can potentially result in genetic predisposition to develop cancer. Indirect evidence for CFS instability in human germ cells has been provided by genomic investigations in family pedigrees associated with genetic disease. The issue of CFS instability in the germ cell line should represent one of the future efforts, and may take advantage of the existence of sequence and functional conservation of CFSs between rodents and humans. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cancer predisposition; common fragile sites; germ cell line; normal cells",Article,Scopus

Autoantibodies to TPO (TPOAbs) are a hallmark of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). Here, we highlight recent progress over several years in understanding TPO biochemistry and function in various pathologies. TPO undergoes complex post-translational modifications as a dimer in endoplasmic reticulum during secretory pathway to apical membrane of thyrocytes. In silico modelling of TPO dimer has provided new information into the two enzyme active site regions and autoantigenic determinants. TPO and hydrogen peroxide generating DUOX and caveolin-1 form a complex known as thyroxisome to bring together in close proximity the components of hormone synthesis in apical membrane. Autoimmunity to TPO is characterised by autoantibodies and T cell reactivity in Hashimoto's disease and Graves' disease. TPOAbs are directed predominantly to two immunodominant determinants (IDR) termed IDR-A and IDR-B regions, with the latter antibodies more predominant in autoimmune disease. Strong genetic risk has been shown to be associated with TPOAbs for AITD development. A different antibody with unusual features of bispecificity for both TPO and thyroglobulin may play protective role in Hashimoto's disease. In the context of TPO biology in human cancer, thyroid tumor tissue and breast cancer differ in TPO expression and isoform composition. In thyroid cancer, TPO expression is decreased partly by the BRAF(V600E) mutation, with direct impact on significant hormone production. TPOAbs may play a protective role in breast cancer development.

Recently, we found that, in androgen-independent prostate cancer PC3 cells, PGE 2 acts through an intracrine mechanism by which its uptake by the prostaglandin transporter (PGT) results in increased intracellular PGE 2 (iPGE 2 ), leading to enhanced cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and loss of cell adhesion to collagen I. These iPGE 2 -mediated effects were dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α), whose expression increased upon epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation by a subset of intracellular PGE 2 receptors. Here, we aimed to study the role of COX in PGE 2 protumoral effects in PC3 cells and found that the effects were prevented by inhibition of COX-2, which highlights its crucial role amplifying the levels of iPGE 2 . Treatment with exogenous PGE 2 determined a transcriptional increase in COX-2 expression, which was abolished by genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of PGT. PGE 2 -induced increase in COX-2 expression and, thereby, in transcriptional increase in HIF-1α expression was due to EGFR activation, leading to the activation of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, Extracellular signal -regulated kinases 1/2, p38 and Mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1 (PI3K/Akt, Erk1/2, p38 and MSK-1). Collectively, the data suggest that EGFR-dependent COX-2 upregulation by a novel positive feedback loop triggered by iPGE 2 underlies the intracrine pro-tumoral effects of PGE 2 in PC3 cells. Therefore, this feedback loop may be relevant in prostate cancer for the maintenance of PGE 2 -dependent cancer cell growth through amplifying the activity of the COX-2 pathway. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2); hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α); intracellular prostaglandin E2 (iPGE 2 ); PC3 cells; prostate cancer (PC)",Article,Scopus

However, whether TET1 is an oncogene or tumor suppressor gene has been controversial; the mechanism of how TET1 affects cancer progression remains unclear. The current study aims to investigate how TET1 is changed in the tumor microenvironment and to explore the mechanisms of how TET1 affects colon cancer progression. Because hypoxia prevails on solid tumors, we established an important connection between hypoxia and DNA demethylation in tumorigenesis. By qPCR and RNA interference (RNAi) technology, we found that hypoxia increased TET1 expression with a hypoxia-inducible factor-1-alpha (HIF-1α)-dependent manner. By CHIP-qPCR and pyrosequencing technology, we demonstrated that TET1 regulated the target gene expression of HIF-1α through HIF-1α binding to hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs), and HIF-1α binding to HREs depended on CpG methylation levels. By Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and transwell assay, we showed that loss of TET1 did not affect cell proliferation but inhibited migration. We also identified two novel gene mutants of TET1 in 120 paired tumor/normal tissue specimens by DNA sequencing and found that TET1 E2082K mutant blocked the TET1-enhanced cell migration. Our results showed that the downregulation of TET1 rescued the abnormally high levels of gene expression resulting from hypoxia in tumors and reduced the migration activity of tumor cells, suggesting a therapeutic role by interference with TET1 in colon cancer treatment. By demonstrating that hypoxia upregulated TET1 and that TET1 drove HIF-1α-responsive genes, we showed that an epigenetic mechanism and tumor microenvironment-driven models coexisted and mutually affected colon cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","colon cancer; hypoxia; hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1); mutation; ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1) protein",Article,Scopus

Although hormone-sensitive PCa responds to androgen-deprivation, there are no effective therapies for castration-resistant PCa. It has been recently suggested that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase the risk of certain cancers; however, association with PCa remains elusive. Here, we evaluated the tumorigenic activities of PPIs in vitro, in PCa cell lines and epithelial cells from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in vivo, in PCa mice xenografts. PPIs increased survival and proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis in LNCaP cells. These effects were attenuated or absent in androgen-insensitive DU-145 and PC3 cells, respectively. Specifically, omeprazole (OME) promoted cell cycle progression, increased c-Myc expression, ErbB2 activity and PSA secretion. Furthermore, OME induced the phosphorylation of MAPK-ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt and GSK-3β, and blunted the expression and activity of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase. OME also increased survival, proliferation and PSA levels in BPH cells. In vivo, OME promoted tumor growth in mice bearing LNCaP xenografts. Our results indicate that PPIs display tumorigenic activities in PCa cells, suggesting that their long-term administration in patients should be carefully monitored. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cellular prostatic acid phosphatase; Primary prostate epithelial cells; Prostate cancer cells; Prostate specific antigen; Proton pump inhibitors",Article,Scopus

Aloe vera has been studied for its potential use in the prevention and treatment of radiation related adverse effects as it possesses a variety of properties and is considered an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Multiple controlled trials have been performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of aloe vera for the prevention and treatment of radiation side effects. Previous systematic reviews have examined the use of aloe vera for radiation-induced skin reactions, however updated literature now includes the use of aloe vera in proctitis. Objectives: The aim of this comprehensive review is to summarize and evaluate the use of aloe vera in patients who have undergone radiation therapy for the treatment of cancer. Results: Aloe vera may not be effective for prophylaxis or treatment of radiation adverse effects in breast cancer patients. Moderate efficacy was seen when aloe vera was used in combination with mild soap versus soap as monotherapy for the treatment of radiation skin reactions. Aloe vera may be effective when cumulative radiation doses are greater than 2,700 cGy and for acute radiation proctitis. Conclusions: There is contradictory evidence for the use of aloe vera in the setting of radiation in regards to its efficacy in the prevention and treatment of radiation-induced adverse effects. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aloe barbadensis; Aloe vera; Cancer; Radiation",Review,Scopus

Thousands of biomarkers have been explored that might be related to survival and prognosis via database mining. However, the prediction effect of single gene biomarkers is not specific enough. Increasing evidence suggests that gene signatures are emerging as a possible better alternative. We aimed to develop a novel gene signature to improve the prognosis prediction of GC. Using the messenger RNA (mRNA)-mining approach, we performed mRNA expression profiling in a large GC cohort (n = 375) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed, and we recovered genes related to the G2/M checkpoint, which we identified with a Cox proportional regression model. We identified a set of five genes (MARCKS, CCNF, MAPK14, INCENP, and CHAF1A), which were significantly associated with overall survival (OS) in the test series. Based on this five-gene signature, the test series patients could be classified into high-risk or low-risk subgroups. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the prognostic power of this five-gene signature was independent of clinical features. In conclusion, we developed a five-gene signature related to the cell cycle that can predict survival for GC. Our findings provide novel insight that is useful for understanding cell cycle mechanisms and for identifying patients with GC with poor prognoses. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cell cycle; gastric cancer; mRNAs; prognostic; survival",Article,Scopus

These complexes not only showed significant cytotoxic effects on the tested cancer cell lines, but also could enhance antitumor immune response. Particularly, complex T2, the mono-conjuagte of oxoplatin and (E)-4-oxo-4-(3-(2-(pyridin-3-yl)vinyl)-1H-indol-1-yl)butanoic acid, displayed 35-fold more potency than cisplatin against TDO-overexpressed HepG-2 cancer cells. Further study indicated that T2 could inhibit TDO via releasing a derivative of a TDO inhibitor and block kynurenine production, resulting in T-cell activation and proliferation in vitro. In vivo tests proved that T2 as a potent immunomodulator could highly promote the antitumor activity of cisplatin and effectively suppress the expression of TDO.

It represents a well-studied ER stress marker but an under-explored target for new drug development. This review aims to untangle the structural and functional diversity of GRP78 modulators, covering over 130 natural products, synthetic molecules, specific peptides and monoclonal antibodies that target GRP78. Several approaches to promote or to incapacitate GRP78 are presented, including the use of oligonucleotides and specific cell-delivery peptides often conjugated to cytotoxic payloads to design GRP78-targeted therapeutics. A repertoire of drugs that turn on/off GRP78 is exposed, including molecules which bind directly to GRP78, principally to its ATP site. There exist many options to regulate positively or negatively the expression of the chaperone, or to interfere with its cellular trafficking. This review provides a molecular cartography of GRP78 pharmacological effectors and adds weight to the notion that GRP78 repressors could represent promising anticancer therapeutics, notably as regards limiting chemo-resistance of cancer cells.

However, no drugs targeting the Wnt pathway exist on the market nor in advanced clinical trials. Here we provide a comprehensive body of preclinical evidence that an anti-leprotic drug clofazimine is effective against TNBC. Clofazimine specifically inhibits canonical Wnt signaling in a panel of TNBC cells in vitro. In several mouse xenograft models of TNBC, clofazimine efficiently suppresses tumor growth, correlating with in vivo inhibition of the Wnt pathway in the tumors. Clofazimine is well compatible with doxorubicin, exerting additive effects on tumor growth suppression, producing no adverse effects. Its excellent and well-characterized pharmacokinetics profile, lack of serious adverse effects at moderate (yet therapeutically effective) doses, its combinability with cytotoxic therapeutics, and the novel mechanistic mode of action make clofazimine a prime candidate for the repositioning clinical trials.

We present a report of rapid development of spinal epidural lipomatosis after treatment with second-generation anti-androgen therapy, a new strategy for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that has been increasingly employed in the past few years. A comprehensive discussion of the underlying molecular networks involving androgen receptor blockage and adipocyte differentiation, as well as the clinical implications of such a phenomenon, are provided. Case Description: We describe the clinical and radiological evolution of a 58-year-old male patient with metastatic prostate cancer, who developed new onset of rapidly progressing lumbosacral epidural lipomatosis with significant compression of the nerve roots of the cauda equina a few months after initiation of treatment with second-generation androgen receptor antagonists. Conclusions: The underlying pathophysiology of adipose tissue growth following the administration of anti-androgen therapy is discussed, with emphasis on both the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway as well as in the Wnt-independent pathway involving direct activation of downstream transcription factors from the T-cell factor family by the androgen receptor. As second-generation androgen receptor antagonists have been increasingly used for treatment of castration-resistant stage metastatic prostate cancer, new onset of symptomatic epidural lipomatosis should be considered as a possible differential diagnosis, especially because the urinary symptoms of cauda equina compression may be improperly attributed to the primary prostate neoplasm. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Anti-androgen therapy; Cauda equina syndrome; Epidural lipomatosis; Prostate cancer",Article,Scopus

Women 18 and over with one or two foci of breast pain and no concurrent breast symptoms were included. 944 patients met criteria. We recorded the imaging work-up, presence and type of finding at the site of pain, BI-RADS® assessment, and pathological outcomes. Subsequent imaging and clinical follow up was recorded. Results: Imaging evaluation consisted of sonogram alone in 286 women, mammogram alone in 231 women, and both in 427 women. 113 women had an imaging finding at the site of pain; 103 were designated benign or probably benign. 12 biopsies of corresponding findings were performed: 9 benign, 1 invasive lobular carcinoma, 1 invasive ductal carcinoma, 1 ductal carcinoma in situ. All three malignancies were seen mammographically; 2 had an ultrasound correlate. At initial evaluation, 4 incidental breast cancers were diagnosed remote from the site of FBP. All were seen on mammogram and 2 of 4 had an ultrasound correlate. On follow up evaluation, 9 cancers were diagnosed at the site of pain and 13 incidental cancers were diagnosed.

Overexpression of HER-2/neu receptors occur in 25–30% of breast cancers, and treatment with trastuzumab inhibits HER-2-overexpressing tumor growth. Notably, HER-2-mediated signaling enhances vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion to increase tumor-associated angiogenesis. Squalamine (aminosterol compound) suppresses VEGF-induced activation of kinases in vascular endothelial cells and inhibits tumor-associated angiogenesis. We assessed antitumor effects of squalamine either alone or with trastuzumab in nude mice bearing breast tumor xenografts without (MCF-7) or with HER2-overexpression (MCF-7/HER-2). Squalamine alone inhibited progression of MCF-7 tumors lacking HER2 overexpression, and squalamine combined with trastuzumab elicited marked inhibition of MCF-7/HER2 growth exceeding that of trastuzumab alone. MCF-7/HER-2 cells secrete higher levels of VEGF than MCF-7 cells, but squalamine elicited no growth inhibition of either MCF-7/HER-2 or MCF-7 cells in vitro. However, squalamine did stop growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and reduced VEGF-induced endothelial tube-like formations in vitro. These effects correlated with blockade of focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation and stress fiber assembly in HUVECs. Thus, squalamine effectively inhibits growth of breast cancers with or without HER-2-overexpression, an effect due in part to blockade of tumor-associated angiogenesis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Breast cancer; MCF-7; Squalamine; Trastuzumab; Tumor-associated angiogenesis; VEGF",Article,Scopus

Results: During median follow-up of 39 months, decreased preoperative LMR was an independent predictor of poor pathological outcomes. Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that patients with low LMR (<3.6) had poor cancer-specific survival (CSS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS); this prognostic value was ascertained for patients with high pathological grade and more advanced stage UTUC, but not for patients with low pathological features. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model revealed that low LMR was an independent predictor of poor CSS, RFS and OS [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.42, P = 0.02; HR = 1.39, P = 0.008; HR = 1.38, P = 0.017, respectively].

Curcumin targets various inflammatory mediators such as cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), thereby attenuating the release of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines, and suppressing chronic production of free radicals, which culminates in the amelioration of tissue toxicity. Through modulation of NF-κB and its downstream signaling cascade, curcumin can also reduce angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis. Low toxicity of curcumin is linked to its cytoprotective effects in normal tissues. This protective action along with the capacity of this phytochemical to sensitize tumor cells to radiotherapy and chemotherapy makes it a potential candidate for use as an adjuvant in cancer therapy. There is also evidence from clinical trials suggesting the potential utility of curcumin for acute inflammatory reactions during radiotherapy such as dermatitis and mucositis. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cancer; chemotherapy; curcumin; inflammation; radiotherapy",Review,Scopus

We hypothesized that NLR is associated with inferior outcomes in localized non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Methods: We evaluated the association of pre-treatment NLR, obtained within 6 months of starting SBRT, with overall survival, as well as primary tumor, regional, and distant recurrence. Multivariate Cox regression was then used to assess pre-treatment NLR as a predictor of mortality. We validated our findings in an independent cohort of patients treated at two other institutions. In a secondary analysis, we also evaluated the association of post-treatment NLR with mortality in the training cohort. Results: A total of 156 patients and 166 tumors were included in the training cohort with a median follow-up of 13.4 months. After dichotomization by median, NLR > 3.6 was associated with mortality on univariate (p = 0.010) and multivariate analysis (p = 0.023). In the validation cohort, NLR > 3.6 was similarly associated with mortality on univariate (p = 0.031) and multivariate (p = 0.007) analysis. In a secondary analysis in the training cohort, we found post-treatment NLR was significantly increased compared to pre-treatment NLR (p < 0.001) and associated with mortality on univariate analysis (p = 0.005) and multivariate analysis (p = 0.010). Conclusions: Pre-treatment NLR > 3.6 is associated with mortality in patients treated with SBRT. This finding was validated in an independent cohort of patients treated at two other institutions. Additionally, post-treatment NLR was significantly increased from pre-treatment and associated with overall survival. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio; Non-small cell lung cancer; Stereotactic body radiation therapy",Article,Scopus

The major reason for its recurrence and high mortality is due to the presence of a drug refractory and self-renewing population of cells, the cancer stem cells (CSCs). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have recently emerged as a promising cell-based therapeutic agent for the treatment of different cancer types. However, the anti-tumor effect of MSCs has been indicated to be substantially reduced by their in vivo tumor-trophic migration property and direct cell-to-cell integration with tumor stromal elements. To address this drawback, the present study uses a biomaterial, sodium alginate, for the encapsulation of MSCs from the perinatal tissue, Wharton's jelly (WJMSCs) into microbeads, to study the effect of WJMSCs beads on breast CSCs derived from two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7. Encapsulation with sodium alginate facilitated the prevention of direct cell-to-cell interaction and these microbeads provided a three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment for the encapsulated WJMSCs (eWJMSCs). Compared to two dimensional (2D) culture, eWJMSC increased proliferation of WJMSCs with an increase in pluripotency genes, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), immune-modulation, and angiogenesis. Interestingly, the tumor invasion suppressor protein E-cadherin was highly expressed in eWJMSCs as shown by Western blot analysis. In addition, eWJMSCs had an increased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines VEGF, TGF-β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-10 and -6, and IL-3β when compared to 2D culture. Treatment of CSCs with eWJMSCs reduced cell viability, inhibited migration, and exerted an anti-angiogenic effect. eWJMSCs treatment of CSCs increased caspase 3/7 activity, nitric oxide production, and reactive oxygen species production, suggesting its anti-tumorigenic activity. Gene expression analysis revealed that CSCs treated with eWJMSCs had a downregulation of pro-proliferation markers, drug transporters, epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated markers, and angiogenesis related genes. The mode of anti-proliferative action of WJMSCs beads was possibly through inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway as indicated by the upregulation of the Wnt antagonists sFRP4 and DKK1. These data suggest that alginate-encapsulated WJMSCs could be an efficient cell contact-free system for developing stem cell-based therapies for CSCs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","3D culture; Cancer stem cells; eMSCs; EMT; Encapsulation; Mesenchymal stem cells; sFRP4; Sodium alginate; Wnt signaling",Article,Scopus

Downregulation of TOX3 mRNA was strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes in ccRCC. Immunohistochemistry confirmed TOX3 was downregulated in primary tumors without metastasis (n = 126) and further downregulated in primary metastatic tumors (n = 23) compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues (n = 92). In vitro, overexpression of TOX3 inhibited RCC cell growth, migration and invasion.

Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs), in which a monoclonal antibody (mAb) is conjugated to biologically active drugs through chemical linkers, have emerged as a promising class of anticancer treatment agents, being one of the fastest growing fields in cancer therapy. The failure of early ADCs led researchers to explore strategies to develop more effective and improved ADCs with lower levels of unconjugated mAbs and more-stable linkers between the drug and the antibody, which show improved pharmacokinetic properties, therapeutic indexes, and safety profiles. Such improvements resulted in the US Food and Drug Administration approvals of brentuximab vedotin, trastuzumab emtansine, and, more recently, inotuzumab ozogamicin. In addition, recent clinical outcomes have sparked additional interest, which leads to the dramatically increased number of ADCs in clinical development.

However, the interaction between HDAC3 and c-Src was previously reported, it has still been ambiguous whether c-Src phosphorylates HDAC3 and affects the function of HDAC3. First, we confirmed that HDAC3 directly binds to c-Src, and c-Src identified to interact with C-terminal domain (277–428 a.a.) of HDAC3. c-Src also phosphorylated three tyrosine sites of HDAC3 at tyrosine 325, 328, and 331. Importantly, wild-type c-Src increases HDAC3 activity, but not mutant c-Src K298M (kinase inactive form). When these tyrosine residues are all substituted for alanine residues, the deacetylase activity of mutant HDAC3 was abolished. In addition, a proliferation of HER2-positive breast cancer cells expressing phosphorylation deficient mutant HDAC3 is decreased in comparison with control cells.

Subjects were excluded in cases of ambiguity regarding the aforementioned definitions and/or lack of clearly documented operability status. Endpoints included local failure (LF) and regional-distant failure, both evaluated with Fine and Gray competing risks regression; Kaplan-Meier methodology analyzed overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Of 952 patients, 408 (42.9%) were operable, and 544 (57.1%) were inoperable. Median follow-up was 22 months. Two-year LF was 9.7% in operable patients and 8.2% in inoperable patients (p = 0.36). There was no statistical difference in regional-distant failure (p = 0.55) between cohorts. Operable patients experienced statistically higher OS (p = 0.04), but not PFS (p = 0.11). Respective 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS in operable patients were 85.4%, 66.2%, and 51.2%. Conclusions: Although patients with operable NSCLC experience higher OS than their inoperable counterparts, disease-related outcomes are similar. These results may better inform shared decision-making between medically operable patients and their multidisciplinary providers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Lung cancer; Non-small cell lung carcinoma; Operable; Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy; Stereotactic body radiation therapy",Article,Scopus

Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay and flow cytometry (FCM) assay with carboxyfluorescein diacetate/succinimidyl ester staining target cells before treatment and propidium iodide (PI) staining dead cells after treatment were conducted to detect the cytotoxic activity. DRLC mice were constructed by injection of PC9 LCSCs suspension and Matrigel into left lung of SD mice. DRLC mice were randomly divided into five groups: control group, cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 CTLs group, OCT4&SOX2 CTLs group, PD-1 inhibitor group, and OCT4&SOX2 CTLs + PD-1 inhibitor group. In vitro, both CCK8 assay and FCM assay disclosed that OCT4&SOX2-specific CTLs plus PD-1 inhibitor presented with elevated cytotoxic activity on PC9 cells and PC9 LCSCs. In vivo, tumor volume and tumor weight were decreased, while tumor necrosis and tumor apoptosis were increased in OCT4&SOX2 CTLs group than CMV pp65 CTLs group and control group, and in OCT4&SOX2 CTLs + PD-1 inhibitor group than OCT4&SOX2 CTLs group and PD-1 inhibitor group. In addition, CD8 expression was increased while OCT4&SOX2 expressions were decreased in OCT4&SOX2 CTLs + PD-1 inhibitor group than OCT4&SOX2 CTLs group and PD-1 inhibitor group.

Aberrant fucosylation, catalyzed by the specific fucosyltransferases (FUTs), is associated with malignant behaviors. Non-conding RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), emerge as key molecules in cancer malignancy. The aim of this study was to investigate HOTAIR/miR-326/FUT6 axis modified fucosylation on sLe X -CD44 (HCELL), which served as E-selectin ligand during CRC progression. Higher levels of HOTAIR and FUT6 were verified in CRC tissues and cell lines, with a positive correlation. HOTAIR was associated with poor clinical prognosis of CRC. Altered HOTAIR levels influenced proliferation, aggressiveness, apoptosis and tumorigenesis of CRC cells. HOTAIR directly harbored miR-326 binding sites and regulated FUT6 expression. Further results corroborated that HOTAIR/miR-326/FUT6 axis modified α1, 3-fucosylation of CD44, which mediated CRC malignancy. Co-modulation of HOTAIR, miR-326 and FUT6 impacted α1, 3-fucosylated CD44, which further triggered PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. HOTAIR also mediated CRC tumorigenesis and liver metastasis in vivo. Thus, our findings indicated that HOTAIR/miR-326/FUT6 axis mediated CRC procession through α1, 3-fucosylated CD44 via PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.

The effects of reaction variables including reaction time, temperature and reactant concentration on the esterification and graft reactions were investigated carefully by conducting orthogonal tests. A maximum degree of substitution (DS) of 1.76 for the esterification and a maximum graft ratio (GR) of 31% can be achieved by performing the reaction at optimized reaction parameters. The molecular docking was further performed to study the binding mode of the final product into the active site of human Caprin-2 C1q domain (4OUM, cause gastric cancer protein), liver cancer protein (1UV0) and lung cancer protein (3B9S). The software generated results were in satisfactory agreement with the evaluated biological activity.

Recently the interface between the C-terminus of K-Ras and calmodulin (CaM) was proposed as a target site to block K-Ras driven cancer cell stemness. We therefore aimed at developing a high-throughput amenable screening assay to identify novel CaM-inhibitors as potential K-Ras stemness-signaling disruptors. A modulated time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (mTR-FRET)-assay was developed and benchmarked against an identically designed fluorescence anisotropy (FA)-assay. In both assays, two CaM-binding peptides were labeled with Eu(III)-chelate or fluorescein and used as single-label reporter probes that were displaced from CaM upon competitor binding. Thus, peptidic and small molecule competitors with nanomolar to micromolar affinities to CaM could be detected, including a peptide that was derived from the C-terminus of K-Ras. In order to detect CaM-residue specific covalent inhibitors, a cell lysate-based Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-assay was furthermore established. This assay enabled us to measure the slow, residue-specific, covalent inhibition by ophiobolin A in the presence of other endogenous proteins. In conclusion, we have developed a panel of fluorescence-assays that allows identification of conventional and covalent CaM-inhibitors as potential disruptors of K-Ras driven cancer cell stemness. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Calmodulin; Cancer stemness; Fluorescence anisotropy; FRET; KRAS; Z′-factor",Article,Scopus

However, recent in vitro research indicates that Tamoxifen inhibits platelet activation, while the effects of Anastrozole on platelet activation are not well characterised. This study investigated platelet activation caused by Tamoxifen or Anastrozole-treated breast cancer cells in vitro. MCF7 and T47D cells were pre-treated with Tamoxifen or Anastrozole to mimic the effects of the drugs in vivo, and co-cultured with whole blood. Platelet activation was determined using flow cytometry. Platelet (CD41a + CD62P + ) was determined using an interval gating strategy. Platelet morphology was visualised using scanning electron microscopy. Our results support clinical findings, showing that hormone-therapy is associated with platelet activation. Tamoxifen-treated MCF7 cells increased P-selectin expression, with ultrastructural analysis showing fully spread platelets. Conversely, Tamoxifen-treated T47D cells decreased P-selectin expression with platelets showing signs of early aggregation. Anastrozole pre-treatment decreased P-selectin expression, with treated MCF7 cells inducing platelet membrane folds and lamellipodia extension, and treated T47D cells inducing platelet aggregation and fibrin network formation indicating hypercoagulation. The findings support clinical studies. Hormone-therapy augments tumour cell-induced platelet activation, which may be linked to cell phenotype.

Materials and methods: In a cross-sectional survey a self-administered questionnaire was used covering patients’ demographics, oncology-related variables and various aspects of CAM use. Data were collected from 135 patients. Data analysis included descriptive analysis and Chi-square tests. Results: The prevalence of CAM use was 52.6% before diagnosis while it was 84.4% during therapy. The most commonly used CAM practices before diagnosis and during therapy were vitamins/minerals (37%, 60%, respectively) and herbs (31.9%, 78.5%, respectively). The frequency of CAM use before diagnosis was higher among more educated patients (p < 0.001) and those living in cities (p = 0.001) while during therapy it was higher among patients with higher income (p = 0.020). Over 40% of the patients informed their physician about each CAM practice they used. Conclusion: Besides conventional medicine, CAM practices are also regarded as an important part of therapy by cancer patients.

We found that miR-1265 expression was negatively correlated with tumor size. Further functional analysis revealed that miR-1265 suppresses cellular proliferation and autophagy while inducing apoptosis in GC cells. A luciferase reporter assay was used to identify an miR-1265 targeted gene, calcium binding protein 39 (CAB39), which is an essential upstream regulator in the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway. Upregulation or downregulation of CAB39 expression reversed the effects of miR-1265 overexpression or inhibition, respectively. Notably, the knockdown of autophagy-related gene 12 (ATG12) impaired the effects of miR-1265 inhibition or CAB39 overexpression in GC. MiR-1265 also suppressed the growth of GC cells in vivo and that of human gastric organoids.

The fast and slow component ADCs of the DWI were calculated for 76 points of the tumor and the contralateral normal parts. Furthermore, the wash-in and wash-out indices of the DCE-MRI were calculated. The correlations for each calculated index were compared. Results: There was a significant difference between the tumor and the contralateral normal parts for both fast (p = 0.03) and slow component (p < 0.01) ADCs.

Several isoflavonoids and flavonoids are known for their cytotoxicity towards various cancer cells. Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the cytotoxicity of isoflavones: osajin (1), 5,7-dihydroxy-4ˈ-methoxy-6,8-diprenylisoflavone (2) and biflavonoids: chamaejasmin (3), 7,7″-di-O-methylchamaejasmin (4) and campylospermone A (5), a dimeric chromene [diphysin(6)] and an ester of ferullic acid with long alkyl chain [erythrinasinate (7)] isolated from the stem bark and roots of the Kenyan medicinal plant, Ormocarpum kirkii. The mode of action of compounds 2 and 4 was further investigated. Methods: The cytotoxicity of compounds was determined based on the resazurin reduction assay. Caspases activation was evaluated using the caspase-Glo assay. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle (propodium iodide (PI) staining), apoptosis (annexin V/PI staining), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (JC-1) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (H 2 DCFH-DA). CCRF-CEM leukemia cells were used as model cells for mechanistic studies. Results: Compounds 1, 2 and 4 displayed IC 50 values below 20 µM towards CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells, and were further tested towards a panel of 7 carcinoma cells. The IC 50 values of the compounds against carcinoma cells varied from 16.90 µM (in resistant U87MG.ΔEGFR glioblastoma cells) to 48.67 µM (against HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells) for 1, from 7.85 µM (in U87MG.ΔEGFR cells) to 14.44 µM (in resistant MDA-MB231/BCRP breast adenocarcinoma cells) for 2, from 4.96 µM (towards U87MG.ΔEGFRcells) to 7.76 µM (against MDA-MB231/BCRP cells) for 4, and from 0.07 µM (against MDA-MB231 cells) to 2.15 µM (against HepG2 cells) for doxorubicin. Compounds 2 and 4 induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells mediated by MMP alteration and increased ROS production. Conclusion: The present report indicates that isoflavones and biflavonoids from Ormocarpum kirkii are cytotoxic compounds with the potential of being exploited in cancer chemotherapy. Compounds 2 and 4 deserve further studies to develop new anticancer drugs to fight sensitive and resistant cancer cell lines. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Apoptosis; Biflavonoid; Cancer; Isoflavone; Multi-drug resistance; Ormocarpum kirkii",Article,Scopus

Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a new class of endogenous non-coding RNAs, are widespread and abundant in mammalian cells. Cumulative evidence showed that circRNAs play significant roles in the process of cancer. However, the expression and function of circRNAs in HCC remain to be investigated. Methods: The expression of circular RNA SMARCA5 (circSMARCA5) in tissues and plasma samples was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The role of circSMARCA5 in HCC progression was assessed by in vitro experiments. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was established to evaluate the value of circSMARCA5 as a biomarker in HCC. Results: The expression of circSMARCA5 was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues compared with para-carcinoma tissues. CircSMARCA5 levels were correlated with tumor differentiation (p = 0.023), Tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (p = 0.001), cancer invasion (p = 0.004), as well as cancer diameter (p = 0.018). In vitro cell experiments revealed that overexpression of circSMARCA5 resulted in inhibited proliferation, increased apoptosis and suppressed invasion. Moreover, we found that circSMARCA5 expression was down-regulated in plasma samples of patients with HCC. The ROC curve analyses revealed that plasma circSMARCA5 showed a high accuracy (AUC = 0.938, 0.853, 0.711) for diagnosing HCC from healthy controls, hepatitis and cirrhosis. The area under the ROC curve of plasma circSMARCA5 in combination with AFP in diagnosing HCC from hepatitis and cirrhosis was 0.903 and 0.858. Especially, plasma circSMARCA5 presented a high accuracy (AUC = 0.847, 0.706) for detecting HCC with serum AFP below 200 ng/ml from those hepatitis and cirrhosis with AFP below 200 ng/ml. Conclusion: Our study revealed that circSMARCA5 may promote apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, invasion and metastasis of HCC cells. CircSMARCA5 may serve as a potential prediction and monitor biomarker for HCC, especially in HCC patients with AFP blow the cutoff value. © 2019","Biomarker; CircSMARCA5; Circular RNA; HCC",Article,Scopus

We report treatment patterns and outcomes for pediatric patients with refractory/recurrent HL (rrHL) treated with curative-intent RT. Materials and methods: Forty-six patients with rrHL treated with salvage RT at our institution were identified. All received risk-adapted, response-based frontline therapy and were retrieved with cytoreductive regimens followed by RT to failure sites, with or without autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT). Cumulative incidence (CIN) of local failure (LF) and survival were estimated after salvage RT and regression models determined predictors of LF after salvage RT. Results: RT was administered as part of frontline therapy in 70% of patients, omitted for early response assessment in 13%, or deferred for primary progression in 17%. AHCT was omitted in 20% of patients. Median initial and salvage dose/site were 25.5 Gy and 30.6 Gy, respectively. Eight patients experienced progression. Two died without progression (median follow-up from salvage RT = 3.8 years). The 5-year CIN of LF after salvage RT was 17.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.2–30.2%). The 5-year freedom from subsequent treatment failure and overall survival (OS) was 80.1% (95% CI, 69.2–92.6%) and 88.5% (95% CI, 79.5–98.6%), respectively. Inadequate response to salvage systemic therapy (p = 0.048) and male sex (p = 0.049) were significantly associated with LF after salvage RT. Conclusion: rrHL is responsive to salvage RT, with low LF rates after moderate doses. OS is excellent, despite refractory disease.

Considering the current situation, we analyzed effects of relationships between tumors and the pleura on treatment outcomes of SBRT for early-stage lung cancer. Materials and methods: Among consecutive patients treated with SBRT between 2006 and 2017, we retrospectively identified non-small cell lung cancer patients with primary tumor diameters ≤4 cm and N0M0. The relationships between tumors and the pleura were investigated. The effects of these findings on treatment outcomes were analyzed. Results: We identified 386 patients which met the inclusion criteria. Among these patients, 323 patients were with tumors of 0.1–3.0 cm (T1-size), and 63 patients were with tumors of 3.1–4.0 cm (T2a-size). Among patients with T1-size tumors, 120, 134, and 23 had findings of pleural contact, pleural indentation, and pleural thickening, respectively. When we divided T1-size patients into 2 groups based on pleural contact (contact− or contact+), the 3-year cause-specific mortality and overall survival in patients with T1-size & contact+ were significantly worse than those in patients with T1-size & contact− (17.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), 10.7–25.9%) vs. 6.6% (95% CI, 3.5–11.1%), p < 0.01), and 58.2% (95% CI, 47.6–67.5%) vs. 77.6% (95% CI, 70.5–83.2%), p < 0.01). Local recurrence, regional recurrence, pleural cavity recurrence, and distant metastasis were associated with worse cause-specific mortality and overall survival. On multivariate analysis, pleural contact was associated with cause-specific mortality (hazard ratio (HR), 1.96; 95% CI, 1.09–3.52; p = 0.03) and overall survival (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.08–2.34; p = 0.02).

The second aim is to compare the performance of methods used in interpretation of posttreatment PET/CT scans (Likert scale, SUVmax, ratios of SUVmax primary lesion to mediastinum ‘SUVmax P/M’ and SUVmax primary lesion to liver ‘SUVmax P/L’) in predicting treatment response. Methods: Seventy-seven PET/CT scans were assessed by Deauville criteria, five-point Likert scale. SUVmax of primary lesion, SUVmax primary to mediastinum and SUVmax primary to liver ratios on first follow-up PET/CT were measured and calculated. Pathology results, clinical and imaging follow-up were used as standart reference. Results: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive value of Likert scale were found to be 80%, 89.5%, 53.3% and 96.8% respectively.

This study describes the kinetic parameters of 11βHSD1 and 11βHSD2 towards the C11-keto and C11-hydroxy derivatives of the C 19 and C 21 steroids. The apparent K m and V max values indicate the more prominent 11βHSD2 activity towards 11β-hydroxy androstenedione, 11β-hydroxytestosterone and 11β-hydroxyprogesterone in contrast to the 11βHSD1 reduction of the C11-keto steroids, as was demonstrated in the LNCaP cell model in the production of 11-ketotestosterone and 11-ketodihydrotestosterone.

The activation of magnetic nanoparticles by an alternating magnetic field is currently being explored as a technique for targeted therapeutic heating of different tumors and is being studied as an adjuvant to conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In the case of bone cancers, to increase the efficiency of treatment in the hyperthermia therapy, employed materials should support bone regeneration as well.

In the present study, a significant positive correlation was observed between UCA1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) levels, and the elevated UCA1 was negatively correlated with the PKB/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in 293T cells. Downregulation of UCA1 inhibited autophagy activation and cell proliferation, whereas the apoptosis was increased and the cell cycle was arrested in G2 stage. The next results showed that UCA1 was markedly upregulated in Caco-2 cells. Knockdown of UCA1 significantly decreased the LC3-II and autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5) protein levels and resulted in an increase in p62 expression. Conversely, the autophagy activator rapamycin (RAPA) reversed the effects. Furthermore, downregulated UCA1 decreased Caco-2 cells population in the G1 phase and increased the cells number in G2 phage. The cell proliferation was inhibited, and apoptosis rate was promoted. More important, RAPA could also abrogate the changes induced by knockdown of UCA1. Collectively, these data demonstrated that downregulated UCA1 induced autophagy inhibition, resulting in suppressing cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis, which suggested that UCA1 might serve as a potential new oncogene to regulate CRC cells viability by modulating autophagy. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","apoptosis; autophagy; cell proliferation; colorectal cancer (CRC) cell; long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) urothelial carcinoma associated 1 (UCA1)",Article,Scopus

In this study, occurrence, health risk and key impact factor of OPEs in drinking water of China were analyzed covering 79 cities, whose population and gross domestic product (GDP) accounted for 28.8% and 44.1% of them in China, respectively. Total concentration of 14 common OPEs in drinking water was 13.42–265.48 ng/L. The exposure level of OPEs via ingestion of drinking water was much lower than that of food ingestion but was comparable with dust ingestion, inhalation and dermal absorption. A health assessment for OPEs via ingestion of drinking water suggested that the potential cancer risk occurred (>1.00E-6) but no obvious non-carcinogenic effects occurred (<1). Tris-(2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate (TDBPP) contributed to about 72.4% of carcinogenic risk, which should be treated as “prior monitoring OPEs” in further studies. The occurrence and distribution of OPEs in drinking water of China have a good corresponding relationship with the Aihui-Tengchong Line, and drinking water treatment technology (DWTT) was found to be a key factor. Total OPEs, halogeno-OPEs and alkyl-OPEs in drinking water from advanced DWTT cities were much lower than those of conventional DWTT cities. Compared with conventional DWTT, advanced DWTT could reduce about 65.6% and 36.5% of carcinogenic risk and non-carcinogenic risk of OPEs, respectively. Considering the annual growth of OPEs consumption in China and world, further studies regarding the environmental threat of OPEs are required. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Drinking water safety; Exposure; Health risk; Key factor; National scale; Organophosphate esters",Article,Scopus

They, however, suffer from patient's proteases degradation and antibody neutralization which lead to short plasma half-lives. One of the ways to overcome these pitfalls is the frequent injection of the drug albeit at the cost of patient compliance which affects the quality of life of patients. There are several techniques available to extend the half-life of therapeutics. Two of the most common protocols are PEGylation and fusion with human serum albumin. These two techniques improve stability, reduce immunogenicity, and increase drug resistance to proteases. These factors lead to the reduction of injection frequency which increases patient compliance and improve quality of life. Both techniques have already been used in many FDA approved drugs. This review describes many technologies to produce long-acting drugs with the attention of PEGylation and the genetic fusion with human serum albumin. The report also discusses the latest modified therapeutics in the field and their application in cancer therapy. We compare the modification methods and discuss the pitfalls of these modified drugs. © 2019","Drug delivery; Half-life extension; Human serum albumin; PEGylations; Protein immunogenicity; Targeted cancer cells",Review,Scopus

This study aimed to further elucidate molecular mechanism by which BRM promotes PC metastasis. We found that silencing BRM reduced PC cell migration and invasion both in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by reduced level of miR-302a-3p. BRM positively regulated the transcription of miR-302a-3p, which acted as a metastasis-promoting miRNA in PC cells. miR-302a-3p directly targeted SOCS5 to boost STAT3 phosphorylation and induce the transcription of STAT3 target genes. Furthermore, miR-302a-3p level was higher in tissue and plasma samples derived from PC patients, and was significantly associated with worse clinical pathological features. In xenograft models, inhibiting miR-302a-3p was synergistically lethal in BRM-silenced PC cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that transcriptional regulation of miR-302a-3p by BRM potentiates PC metastasis by epigenetically suppressing SOCS5 expression and activating STAT3 signaling. These new findings provide potential therapeutic avenues for preventing PC-associated death. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","BRM; Metastasis; miR-302a-3p; Pancreatic cancer; SOCS5; STAT3",Article,Scopus

Shortcomings of basic cell culture systems in recreating in vivo interactions have driven the development of more efficient and biomimetic in vitro environments for cancer research. Assimilation of certain developments in tissue engineering will accelerate and improve the design of these environments. With the continual improvement of the tumor engineering field, the next step is towards macroscopic systems such as scaffold-supported, flow-perfused macroscale tumor bioreactors. Surface modifications of synthetic scaffolds allow for targeted cell adhesion and improved ECM development. Flow perfusion has emerged as means to expose cancerous tissues to critical biomechanical forces for tumor progression while simultaneously improving nutrient and waste transport. Macroscale perfusable systems allow for non-destructive real-time monitoring using biosensors capable of improving understanding of in vitro tumor development at reduced cost and waste.

Methods: MpMRI was performed in 30 men with PCa prior to treatment, after 10 days and at 6 months. An additional scan at 1 year was available for 18 men. Two radiologists assessed retrospectively the following parameters by planimetry: tumour volume, necrotic volume (early post-treatment scan) and residual fibrosis. Residual tumour/recurrence were defined as a suspicious area within the treatment field scored ≥ 4 on a 1-to-5 scale. Oncological outcome was also assessed. Results: The median follow-up of the entire study was 16 months. Six men were undertreated and showed mpMRI recurrence after 6 months. At 1-year, three additional men had recurrence. Overall, four of these 9 men (44%) were retreated. The other five men did not receive any further treatment. Median time to re-treatment was 15 months. Median pre-treatment lesion volume was 0.65 cc, 0.66 cc and 0.43 cc on the different mpMRI sequences (T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging). Median necrotic volume was 10.77 cc. Median overall residual fibrosis volume were 0.84 cc and 0.95 cc at 6-month and 1-year mpMRI. Pre-treatment, necrotic and residual fibrosis volumes were significantly different (p < 0.001). Pre-treatment tumour volumes on diffusion-weighted imaging and necrotic volumes were correlated (r = 0.18; p = 0.02). Conclusions: MpMRI is able to visualise the IRE ablation effects in men with PCa.

Methods: OSCC patients treated with PO-IMRT were divided into discovery (2005–2012) and validation (2013–2014) cohorts. DM predictors were identified from multivariable analysis (MVA) to derive low- and high-risk groups in the discovery-cohort. The result was subsequently evaluated in validation-cohort. Results: Overall 447 patients were included (discovery-cohort: n = 300, and validation-cohort: n = 147). Between the two cohorts, there were no significant differences in DM (p = 0.16) or OS (p = 0.26). MVA identified pN2-3 and histological grade 2–3 (G2-3) as DM predictors. High-risk group included patients who had both poor predictors (pN2-3 and G2-3), while low-risk group included patients with no or only one poor predictor.

Unfortunately, aggressive tumors could rapidly develop into a castration resistant state. It is therefore essential to look for new molecules that are more effective, affecting not only the androgen signaling and with minimum undesirable effects. Natural products are an interesting source of new therapeutics, especially for cancer therapy as 70% of them have botanical origin. Based on an ethnobotany screening, we evaluated the effects of ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP) from Algeria on LNCaP cells. Results pointed out that EEP reduces the survival of LNCaP cells with an IC 50 of 0.04 mg/ml, induces the apoptosis and blocks the cell cycle at G0/G1 phase. Interestingly, EEP decreased the accumulation of AR suggesting some anti-androgen activity. Indeed, secreted amount of the androgen target protein PSA was decreased when LNCaP cells were incubated with EEP, starting after 4 h of treatment. This anti-androgen activity was also shown on the androgen target genes Fkbp5 and Sgk1. Finally, the capacity of EEP to block AR functioning was demonstrated in transient transfections with human AR and the reporter gene ARE-tk-Luc. Propolis antagonizes the induction of the luciferase activity induced by the natural androgen DHT (10 −8 M) or the synthetic AR agonist R1881 (10 -7 M). Altogether, these results highlight the potential pharmacological effects of EEP in future treatments of prostate cancer. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Androgen receptor; Anti-androgen activity; Propolis; Prostate cancer",Article,Scopus

Methods: Potent men with localized prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy alone were enrolled in an institutional review board-approved prospective cohort study. Men received HD-IGRT as primary treatment of prostate cancer. Patient-reported inventories were used to assess erectile function at baseline, 6 months, 2 years, and 5 years after treatment. Long-term potency rates were compared to validated models, and baseline factors were used to create a novel, internally validated nomogram for predicting long-term function. Results: 1,159 men were treated with HD-IGRT. Among 676 men who were potent at baseline and did not receive hormone therapy, the potency rates at 6 months, 2 years, and 5 years were 81%, 68%, and 61%. Recursive partitioning categorized patients into 3 groups based on two factors: baseline response to EPIC Q57 (ability to have an erection) and pre-existing heart disease. At 5 years, the most favorable group reported “very good” on Q57 and had an 80% potency rate (n = 137; p = 0.83); the intermediate group reported “good” on Q57 and had no baseline cardiac disease with a 62% potency rate (n = 145; p = 0.86); and the remaining poor risk group had a 37% potency rate (n = 117; p = 0.19). Conclusions: Patient-reported pretreatment sexual function and comorbidities enables stratification and prediction of erectile function.

Recent studies have demonstrated that artemisinin (ART) displays anti-tumor activity. Using a mouse breast cancer model, we investigated the effects of ART in vitro and in vivo to determine how it influences the anti-tumor immune response. Methods: We measured the proliferation and apoptosis of 4T1 cells in vitro after ART treatment by MTT assay and FACS. To examine the effects of ART in vivo, tumor volumes and survival rates were measured in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. FACS was used to determine the frequencies of Tregs, MDSCs, CD4 + IFN-γ + T cells, and CTLs in the tumors and spleens of the mice. mRNA levels of the transcription factors T-bet and FOXP3 and cytokines IFN-γ TNF-α TGF-β and IL-10 were also determined by real-time RT-PCR. ELISA was used to measure TGF-β protein levels in the cell culture supernatants. Results: ART supplementation significantly increased 4T1 cell apoptosis and decreased TGF-β levels in vitro. ART also impeded tumor growth in 4T1 TB mice and extended their survival. MDSC and Treg frequencies significantly decreased in the 4T1 TB mice after ART treatment while CD4 + IFN-γ + T cells and CTLs significantly increased. ART significantly increased T-bet, IFN-γ and TNF-α mRNA levels within the tumor and significantly decreased TGF-β mRNA levels.

However, poor tumor penetration remains a key problem for the efficacy of IL-24 as a treatment. The iRGD (CRGDK/RGPDC) is a novel tumor-specific peptide with unique tumor-penetrating and cell-internalizing properties. To enhance the tumor-penetrating effects of IL-24, the iRGD peptide was fused with the C-terminal domain of IL-24 to generate a novel recombinant protein, IL-24-iRGD. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antitumor effects of IL-24-iRGD in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in vitro and in vivo. It was observed that IL-24-iRGD increased the production of IL-6, TNF-α and INF-γ from human peripheral blood monocyte (PBMC), and suppressed cell growth of A549 in vitro. Then A549 cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice, and these tumor-bearing mice were immunized with IL-24, IL-24-iRGD or PBS via the tail vein. The IL-24 and IL-24-iRGD-treated groups exhibited tumor growth inhibition rates of 26.2% and 59.1%, respectively, when compared with the PBS-treated group. Protein penetration into tumors was analyzed by immunofluorescence, cell apoptosis was examined by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 was analyzed by immuno-histochemical staining. The results demonstrated that IL-24-iRGD induced apoptosis and inhibited the growth of A549 cells to a significantly greater extent when compared with IL-24 treatment alone. It may provide an improved strategy for antitumor therapy and the clinical treatment of NSCLC. © 2019","A549; Interleukin-24; iRGD; Non-small cell lung cancer; Tumor-penetrating peptide",Article,Scopus

A total of 4040 consecutive patients with PTC receiving thyroidectomy and central lymph node dissection were enrolled from 2013 to 2018. Pathological features of tumors and urinary iodine concentration (UIC) were recorded. Multivariate analysis was performed to investigate the association between iodine intake and CLNM of PTC. More than adequate (UIC: 200.0-299.9 μg/L) and excessive iodine intake (UIC ≥ 300.0 μg/L) were present in 1741 cases (43.09%). Iodine deficiency (UIC ≤ 99.9 μg/L) was inversely associated with female PTC risk only with OR (95% CI): 0.48 (0.29–0.80) relative to adequate iodine intake (UIC: 100.0–199.9 μg/L). However, more than adequate and excessive iodine intake was not associated with PTC risk among the general population and patients with thyroid nodules. In addition, high iodine intake was not associated CLNM risk of PTC. After defining CLNM as metastatic lymph nodes ≥ 2, excessive iodine intake was marginally associated with CLNM among female PTC patients with OR (95% CI): 1.25 (0.99–1.57) by multivariate analysis. Additionally, excessive iodine intake was marginally associated with larger tumor size and capsular invasion. Furthermore, we found that female PTC patients were more closely linked with iodine intake than male ones.

MCM-41 type of MSNs was synthesized using modified Stober's process and further modified by first reacting with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and then succinic anhydride (SA) in order to obtain carboxylic acid functionalized MSN-COOH. Anastrozole was loaded into the MSNs and then capped with chitosan-folate conjugate. The MSNs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential analysis, small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), HPLC and UV-visible spectroscopy. In vitro release studies confirmed triggered drug release from these nanoparticles under acidic (pH 5.5) environment. Hemolysis study proved that the formulation was safe for intravenous administration. The formulation exhibited 1.5 folds higher cytotoxicity as compared to free drug indicating its improved therapeutic potency. The in-vivo anticancer activity of formulations was studied against Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) induced breast cancer in Balb C mice in which these nanoparticles showed superior anticancer activity. Excellent tumor suppressing activity was demonstrated by these nanoparticles against EAC induced breast cancer model. © 2018","Active targeting; Anticancer activity; Chitosan-folate conjugate; Mesoporous silica nanoparticles; pH responsive",Article,Scopus

Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) activation promotes IFN-β production, which induces apoptosis and impairs proliferation in some cancer cells. Herein, we tested whether the TLR3 agonist polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) can improve chemotherapeutic efficacy in paclitaxel (PTX) resistant cell lines. Human colon cancer cell lines HCT116, SW620, HCT-8 (sensitive to PTX), and HCT-8/PTX (resistant to PTX) were treated with poly I:C and the cell viability was measured. Results showed that poly I:C specifically impaired the cell viability of HCT-8/PTX by simultaneously promoting cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation. In addition, when TLR3 was overexpressed in HCT-8/PTX cells, we found that TLR3 contributed to the production of IFN-β that reduced cell viability, and poly I:C preferentially activated the TLR3-UNC93B1 signaling pathway to mediate this effect. Moreover, cotreatment of poly I:C and PTX acted synergistically to induce cell apoptosis of HCT-8/PTX via upregulating the expression of TLR3 and its molecular chaperone UNC93B1, assisting in the secretion of IFN-β. Notably, a combination of poly I:C and PTX synergistically inhibited the PTX-resistant tumor growth in vivo without side effects. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that poly I:C reinforces the potency of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics in PTX-resistant cell line through the TLR3-UNC93B1-IFN-β signaling pathway, which supplies a novel mechanism of poly I:C for the chemotherapy sensitizing effect in a PTX-resistant tumor. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","HCT-8/paclitaxel (PTX); interferon (IFN)-β; polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I:C); toll-like receptor (TLR3); UNC93B1",Article,Scopus

In our study, we evaluated the effects of combining EGCG with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and radiotherapy on oral squamous cell cancer. We evaluated whether the combination of lower doses of 5-FU with EGCG could be equally or more effective than the use of higher doses of 5-FU alone. Methods: Cell viability, migration and cell cycles were assayed in oral cancer cell lines treated with 5-FU, 5-FU + EGCG and radiation (0, 2.5 and 5 Gy). Results: This study found that the combination of EGCG with 5-FU reduced cell viability and migration distance compared to control samples and the same dose of 5-FU alone. Addition of EGCG increased the number of cells in the G2/M phase, while 5-FU arrested the cell cycle in phase S. Moreover, cell exposure to 5 Gy radiation decreased the effects of combining with EGCG. Conclusions: In summary, the combination of EGCG and 5-FU reduced both cell viability and migration as well as altered the cell cycle to a greater extent than 5-FU alone. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","5-Fluorouracil; Epigallocatechin-3-gallate; In vitro; Oral squamous cell carcinoma; Radiotherapy",Article,Scopus

In the platinum(II) complex two pyridine nitrogen atoms of the 7AI3CAH ligands and two chloride ligands are coordinated to the central metal atom, in a square-planar trans arrangement. In the polymeric copper(II) complex the coordination geometry is a tetragonal bipyramid (4 + 2), where the in-plane ligands are two pyridine nitrogen atoms of two organic ligands and two trans-bromide ligands. The apical positions of bipyramid are occupied by the two Br ligands from the neighboring units. Thus, the Cu Br Br Cu double bridge system is formed.

The ability to predict disease recurrence following CRT has the potential to inform personalized radiotherapy approaches currently being explored in novel clinical trials. Methods: An IRB waiver was obtained for retrospective analysis of standard care MRIs from ASCC patients presenting between 2010 and 2014. Whole tumor 3D volume-of-interest (VOI) was outlined on T2-weighted (T2w) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) of the pre- and post-treatment scans. Independent imaging features most predictive of disease recurrence were added to the baseline clinico-pathological model and the predictive value of respective extended models was calculated using net reclassification improvement (NRI) algorithm. Cross-validation analysis was carried out to determine percentage error reduction with inclusion of imaging features to the baseline model for both endpoints. Results: Forty patients who underwent 1.5 T pelvic MRI at baseline and following completion of CRT were included. A combination of two baseline MR heterogeneity features (baseline T2w energy and DWI coefficient of variation) was most predictive of disease recurrence resulting in significant NRI (p = 0 < 0.001). This was confirmed in cross-validation analysis with 34.8% percentage error reduction for the primary endpoint and 18.1% reduction for the secondary endpoint with addition of imaging variables to baseline model.

Methods: 792 and 433 patients with pathologically proven NPC and complete clinical and magnetic resonance imaging records at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center and Foshan Hospital were enrolled, and investigated using heat map/cluster, network and survival analyses. Results: The results of heat map/cluster analyses and network analysis showed that T3 patients with pterygoid process and/or base of the sphenoid bone invasion (T3 slight) had better treatment outcomes than those with other SBIs (T3 severe). Significant differences were observed between T3-slight and T3-severe groups with regard to 5-year overall survival (OS) (93.0% vs. 83.5%, p = 0.014) and progression-free survival (PFS) (82.5% vs. 74.1%, p = 0.044) rates.

However, the mechanisms underlying HCC progression and metastasis are still in obscure. Here, we used bioinformatic analysis to identify miRNAs that regulate GP73, a specific marker for HCC diagnosis and prognosis. The correlations between miR-141-3p and clinic-pathological factors were analyzed in HCC patient samples; proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation were studied using established HCC cell lines. Expression levels of target genes (miR-141-3p, GP73, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, occludin, vimentin, and cytokeratin 18) were detected by either Western blot or qRT-PCR analysis. Xenograft models were established to evaluate tumor growth and metastasis. MiR-141-3p was significantly reduced in HCC tumors and cell lines, highly correlated with tumor progression. In contrast, GP73 was negatively correlated with miR-141-3p in HCC tumors. MiR-141-3p overexpression significantly decreased HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). GP73 overexpression partially restored the inhibitory effects of miR-141-3p, while miR-141-3p overexpression markedly inhibited tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis, which were partially reversed by GP73 overexpression. Our findings suggest that miR-141-3p targets GP73 to reverse EMT, subsequently inhibiting HCC progression and metastasis. Thus, overexpression of miR-141-3p could serve as a therapeutic strategy to arrest HCC. © 2019","Epithelial-mesenchymal transition; GP73; Hepatocellular carcinoma; miR-141-3p",Article,Scopus

As promising cell sorting methods, dielectrophoresis (DEP) and hydrodynamics are attracting much attention in recent years. In this paper, we report a novel strategy by coupling DEP unit (3D sidewall electrodes) and hydrodynamic unit (microchannels with contraction/expansion structures) together in one microfluidic chip. Depending on the relative positions of 3D sidewall electrodes and contraction/expansion structure, three microchips (full-coupling, semi-coupling and non-coupling) are developed and their cell sorting performance are compared by isolating lung cancer cells (PC-9 cells) from red blood cells (RBCs). Both finite element simulation and practical cell sorting prove that high cell sorting efficiency (recovery of PC-9 cells: 90.21%, recovery of RBCs: 94.35%) can be achieved in full-coupling microchip, mainly owing to the synergistic effects between DEP sorting and hydrodynamic sorting. i.e., the positive DEP force generated by 3D sidewall electrodes can simultaneously act as an additional shear gradient lift force and thus trigger secondary flow even at low flow velocity. Live/dead cell staining, hemolysis ratio, fluorescence images and CCK-8 assay prove that RBCs and PC-9 cells show no significance difference in cell viability before and after cell sorting. The proposed coupling platform for cell sorting brings on a new pathway to construct integrated microfluidic chips for effective cell sorting and separation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","3D sidewall electrode; Cancer cell; Cell sorting; Dielectrophoresis; Hydrodynamics; Red blood cells",Article,Scopus

To overcome, we have synthesized nanoparticles with controlled sized hydroxyapatite (nHAp) materials doped and co-doped with silver and iron by co-precipitation, yielding materials that can treat both the infections and malignant tumors with non-cytotoxic nature to normal cells. Spherical and rod like morphologies were observed for the samples with higher Ag + doping concentrations with average size of 50 ± 5 nm and (75 × 22) ± 5 nm 2 , whereas higher Ag + /Fe 2+ co-doping concentrations yielded samples with spherical, rod-like, and flake-like structures. For samples nHAp and Ag + -nHAp samples were diamagnetic, whereas the Fe 2+ -nHAp and Ag + /Fe 2+ co-doped samples were superparamagnetic. The in vitro biological toxicity study revealed that the Ag + /Fe 2+ -nHAp nanoparticles are effective for targeting to kill cancerous cells, for example, human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells efficiently while they are non-toxic to normal cells. Applying these nanoparticles for drug delivery system, 5-fluorouracil was loaded in the nanoparticles and studied its release kinetics. In the case of Ag + /Fe 2+ co-doped nHAp samples, a pulsatile drug release profile was observed, which the drug was released for about a week on varying the Ag + and Fe 2+ concentrations. The 5-fluorouracil release kinetics was well fitted by the first-order model with diffusion. Thus, nHAps co-doped with Ag + /Fe 2+ material have the potential to lag the time on delivering the drug at site-specific could be with an application in biomedicine such as to treat malignant tumor without any bacterial side effect. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biocompatible; Controlled drug delivery; Hydroxyapatite; Non-cytotoxic; Superparamagnetic; Tumor-cell targeting",Article,Scopus

Methods: This was a randomized, open, controlled longitudinal study with intervention in outpatient patients with gastric cancer. Sixty-eight patients were randomized into two groups and received either a formula enriched with ω-3 (intervention group [IG]) or standard formula without ω-3 (control group) for 30 d consecutively. Nutritional status (based on patient-generated subjective global assessment, bioimpedance, and anthropometric measurements) and immune and inflammatory parameters were collected before and after supplementation. Results were expressed as frequency, median, and interquartile intervals and were compared by non-parametric test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Thirty-four patients were included in each group. Of the patients, 64.7% were men, 44.1% were older than 60 years, and 45.6% had stage III disease. There was an increase in C-reactive protein in the control group before and after supplementation, in addition to the worsening in some anthropometric parameters, such as arm muscle area and arm muscle circumference. There was maintenance of the immune profile in both groups.

Thus, targeting mechanisms that protect cancer cells from the tumor-inhibitory consequences of their redox imbalance and spontaneous DNA-damaging events is expected to have broad-spectrum efficacy and a high therapeutic index. One critical mechanism for tumor cell protection from oxidant stress is the hydrolysis of oxidized nucleotides. Human MutT homolog 1 (MTH1), the mammalian nudix (nucleoside diphosphate X) pyrophosphorylase (NUDT1), protects tumor cells from oxidative stress-induced genomic DNA damage by cleansing the nucleotide pool of oxidized purine nucleotides. Depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of MTH1 results in genomic DNA strand breaks in many cancer cells. However, the mechanisms underlying how oxidized nucleotides, thought mainly to be mutagenic rather than genotoxic, induce DNA strand breaks are largely unknown. Given the recent therapeutic interest in targeting MTH1, a better understanding of such mechanisms is crucial to its successful translation into the clinic and in identifying the molecular contexts under which its inhibition is likely to be beneficial. Here we provide a comprehensive perspective on MTH1 function and its importance in protecting genome integrity, in the context of tumor-associated oxidative stress and the mechanisms that likely lead to irreparable DNA strand breaks as a result of MTH1 inhibition. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","8-oxoguanine; Cancer; DNA repair; DNA strand breaks; MTH1; Reactive oxygen species (ROS)",Review,Scopus

Materials and methods: The study included 131 CT scans from 35 pancreatic cancer patients treated with Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT). For each patient, day-to-day anatomical variations of the stomach, the duodenum and the bowel were assessed from the deformation vector fields (DVF) obtained by non-rigidly registering the contours of the fractions to the planning CT scans. For the whole population, day-to-day motion-deformation patterns were abstracted using principal component analysis (PCA) on the set of DVFs mapped on a reference patient. Based on these geometrical variations, anatomies were generated to create population-based dose-volume histograms (DVH) per patient, which were also compared to clinical values. Results: Through PCA, the most dominant directions of daily deformations were localized in the abdominal organs. Common patterns were found, such as stomach contraction–expansion in the anterior–posterior direction ranging from 5 to 13 mm, and superior-inferior deformations on the bowel from 7 to 14 mm. The duodenum resulted to move laterally, but in a lesser extent (4–8 mm). The population-based DVHs derived from the model mostly included the daily DVHs observed in the clinic (in >90% of the cases). Conclusions: Anatomical variations influence the delivered doses to healthy organs during SBRT. A motion model was successfully built and explored to extract the larger directions of movement of the gastrointestinal organs. Day-to-day motion modeling can potentially be used to account for geometrical uncertainties in future plan optimization and in online adaptive strategies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Daily geometric variations; Organ motion management; Pancreas; PCA; SBRT; Statistical motion-deformation model",Article,Scopus

Moreover, it functions as hub in the stress response by orchestrating a variety of processes, such as regulation of cell cycle progression, senescence and apoptosis. Emerging evidence links the nucleolus also to the control of genomic stability and the development of human malignancies. Peter Pan (PPAN) is an essential ribosome biogenesis factor localized to nucleoli and mitochondria. We earlier showed that PPAN depletion triggers p53-independent nucleolar stress and apoptosis. In this study we investigated the precise localization of nucleolar PPAN during cell cycle and its function in cell cycle regulation. We show that PPAN knockdown impairs cell proliferation and induces G0/G1 as well as later G2/M cell cycle arrest in cancer cells. Although PPAN knockdown stabilizes the tumor suppressor p53 and induces CDKN1A/p21, the proliferation defects occur largely in a p53/p21-independent manner. We noticed a reduced number of knockdown cells entering cytokinesis and an elevation of binucleation. PPAN knockdown is also associated with increased H2A.X phosphorylation (γH2A.X) in cancer cells. We evaluated a potential signaling axis through the DNA damage response kinases ATM and ATR and alternatively apoptosis as a potent driver of γH2A.X. Interestingly, PPAN knockdown does not involve activation of ATM/ATR. Instead, γH2A.X is generated as a consequence of apoptosis induction in cancer cells. Strikingly, PPAN depletion in human fibroblasts did neither provoke apoptosis nor H2A.X phosphorylation, but recapitulated p53 stabilization. In summary, our data underline the notion that the PPAN-mediated, p53-independent nucleolar stress response has multiple facets. © 2019","Apoptosis; Cell cycle; Nucleolus; p53; PPAN; Ribosome",Article,Scopus

For the 10 cases included in our cohort, the median age was 64 and the median tumor stage was IIa/IIb. All patients underwent either a primary or interval debulking surgery and achieved an R0 resection per classifications set by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC). Lymph node dissections were performed on 6 patients and found no evidence of positive nodal disease. 7 patients received platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy and experienced a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 37 months. Recurrent disease was varied in terms of locoregional versus distant spread, and these patients had largely suboptimal responses to salvage chemotherapy with doxorubicin, gemcitabine, and eribulin. Sites of metastatic disease included the liver, lungs, bone, and brain. While there is no consensus for the optimal treatment of this rare disease, MBTs seem to respond well to adjuvant platinum-taxane treatment after complete surgical resection, consistent with the current management approach of other epithelial ovarian cancers. Recurrent disease is considerably more difficult to manage, and clinicians may consider a wider avenue of treatment options to include hormonal, biologic, and radiation therapies. © 2019","Case series; Malignant Brenner tumor; MBT; Ovarian carcinoma; Review; Treatment",Article,Scopus

Paclitaxel (PCL) was co-encapsulated into the same cationic carrier for the purpose of improving of therapeutic efficacy for a combined cancer treatment with LMWH. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that the LMWH and PCL release was significantly affected by polymer molecular weight and block composition. Skin penetration tests have indicated that larger amounts of LMWH were absorbed from LMWH-gel conjugate through SC, than aqueous formula. However, it was found that the plasma transition of LMWH released from gel conjugate was lower compared to the plasma concentration of LMWH released from aqueous solution.

Methods: The transcriptional level of PLK1 was measured by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Expressions of PLK1 and its downstream mediators as well as autophagy-related protein LC3 I/LC3 II were detected by western blot. An 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine immunofluorescent staining were conducted to evaluate the cell viability and replication activity separately. Flow cytometry was carried out to determine the cell cycle status. The GFP-LC3 vector contributed toward tracking the formation and aggregation of autophagosomes. Results: Drug-resistant SGC-7901/DDP cells showed insignificant changes in all phases after DDP treatment, including DNA replication, cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis, whereas DDP could significantly improve the autophagy level of SGC-7901/DDP as well as PLK1expression. By downregulating the expression of PLK1, both BI2536 andsi-PLK1 enhanced SGC-7901/DDP sensitivity to DDP, suppressing the proliferation and autophagy as well as improving the apoptosis rate. PLK1 inhibition also resulted in the repression of cell division regulators CDC25C and cyclin B1.

PLK1 inhibition, including si-PLK1 and BI2536 treatment, could restore the chemosensitivity of drug-resistant SGC-7901/DDP cells and enhance the efficacy of DDP, revealing the potential value of PLK1 inhibition in GC chemotherapy. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","autophagy; BI2536; cisplatin; gastric cancer; PLK1",Article,Scopus

However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying H. pylori-related GC need further elucidation. We investigated the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network differences between H. pylori (+) and H. pylori (−) GC. The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression data from 32 adjacent noncancerous samples and 18 H. pylori (+) and 141 H. pylori (−) stomach adenocarcinoma samples were downloaded from the TCGA database. After construction of lncRNA–miRNA–mRNA ceRNA networks of H. pylori (+) and H. pylori (−) GC, Panther and Kobas databases were used to analyze the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Finally, survival analysis was used to discover the key genes. In H. pylori (+) GC, we identified a total of 1,419 lncRNAs, 82 miRNAs, and 2,501 mRNAs with differentially expressed profiles. In H. pylori (−) GC, 2,225 lncRNAs, 130 miRNAs, and 3,146 mRNAs were differentially expressed. Furthermore, three unique pathways (cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, HIF-1 signaling pathway, and Wnt signaling pathway) were enriched in H. pylori (+) GC. According to the overall survival analysis, three lncRNAs (AP002478.1, LINC00111, and LINC00313) and two mRNAs (MYB and COL1A1) functioned as prognostic biomarkers for patients with H. pylori (+) GC. In conclusion, our study has identified the differences in ceRNA regulatory networks between H. pylori (+) and H. pylori (−) GC and provides a rich candidate reservoir for future studies. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ceRNA network; gastric cancer; Helicobacter pylori; lncRNA; miRNA",Article,Scopus

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-infected individuals remain asymptomatic; but under certain stress conditions, EBV may lead to the development of cancers such as Burkitt’s and Hodgkin’s lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. EBV-associated cancers result in a large number of deaths in Asian and African population, and no effective cure has still been developed. We, therefore, tried to devise a subunit vaccine with the help of immunoinformatic approaches that can be used for the prevention of EBV-associated malignancies. The epitopes were predicted through B-cell, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), and helper T lymphocytes (HTL) from the different oncogenic proteins of EBV. A vaccine was designed by combining the B-cell and T-cell (HTL and CTL) epitopes through linkers, and for the enhancement of immunogenicity, an adjuvant was added at the N-terminal. Further, homology modeling was performed to generate the 3D structure of the designed vaccine. Moreover, molecular docking was performed between the designed vaccine and immune receptor (TLR-3) to determine the interaction between the final vaccine construct and the immune receptor complex. In addition, molecular dynamics was performed to analyze the stable interactions between the ligand final vaccine model and receptor TLR-3 molecule. Lastly, to check the expression of our vaccine construct, we performed in silico cloning.

The expression and biological roles of LINC00961 have been reported in many human cancers. However, up to date, no study of LINC00961 has been shown in RCC. Currently, we aimed to investigate the function of LINC00961 in RCC progression. Interestingly, we observed that LINC00961 could act as a novel biomarker in predicting the diagnosis of RCC. Then, we found that LINC00961 was greatly downregulated in RCC cell lines (Caki-1, Caki-2, 786-O, A498, and ACHN cells) compared with normal renal cell lines (HK-2 cells). Then, 786-O cells and ACHN cells were infected with LV-LINC00961. As displayed in our current study, LINC00961 overexpression could obviously suppress the proliferation and survival of RCC cells in vitro. In addition, RCC cell apoptosis was greatly induced and cell cycle progression was blocked in G1 phase by upregulation of LINC00961 in 786-O cells and ACHN cells. Subsequently, we found that LV-LINC00961 was able to restrain RCC cell migration and cell invasion capacity. Meanwhile, the messenger RNA and protein expression levels of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated markers Slug and N-cadherin in RCC cell lines were dramatically inhibited by overexpressing LINC00961. Finally, the in vivo experiment was carried out and we observed that LINC00961 could inhibit RCC development through modulating EMT process. Taken these together, it was indicated in our study that LINC00961 was involved in RCC progression through targeting EMT pathway. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","EMT signaling; LINC00961; renal cell carcinoma",Article,Scopus

Both neonatal and adult forms of Nav1.5 (nNav1.5 and aNav1.5, respectively) have been reported to be expressed at messenger RNA (mRNA) level in colorectal cancer (CRCa) cells. Here, three CRCa cell lines (HT29, HCT116 and SW620) were studied and found to express nNav1.5 mRNA and protein. In SW620 cells, adopted as a model, effects of gene silencing (by several small interfering RNAs [siRNAs]) selectively targeting nNav1.5 or aNav1.5 were determined on (a) channel activity and (b) invasiveness in vitro. Silencing nNav1.5 made the currents more “adult-like” and suppressed invasion by up to 73%. Importantly, subsequent application of the highly specific, general VGSC blocker, tetrodotoxin (TTX), had no further effect. Conversely, silencing aNav1.5 made the currents more “neonatal-like” but suppressed invasion by only 17% and TTX still induced a significant effect. Hypoxia increased invasiveness and this was also blocked completely by siRNA targeting nNav1.5. The effect of hypoxia was suppressed dose dependently by ranolazine, but its effect was lost in cells pretreated with nNav1.5-siRNA. We conclude that (a) functional nNav1.5 expression is common to human CRCa cells, (b) hypoxia increases the invasiveness of SW620 cells, (c) the VGSC-dependent invasiveness is driven predominantly by nNav1.5 under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions and (d) the hypoxia-induced increase in invasiveness is likely to be mediated by the persistent current component of nNav1.5. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","colorectal cancer; hypoxia; invasion; ranolazine; voltage-gated sodium channel",Article,Scopus

Increasing evidences have suggested that bufadienolides contain several fractions displaying antitumor activity and may be applied in lymphatic chemotherapy. However, effects of the highly efficient and lowly toxic (HELT) bufadienolides on CRC in lymphatic chemotherapy have not been reported. Methods: Adenosine triphosphate tumor chemosensitivity assays (ATP-TCA) was performed to detect the inhibition rate (IR) of fractions of bufadienolides to cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells and tumor cells. HELT fraction-loaded emulsions of different concentrations were prepared. Nude mouse bearing HCT116 tumors in footpad received high-dose emulsion (HD-E), middle-dose emulsion (MD-E), low-dose emulsion (LD-E), control emulsion (CE), Cinobufacini Injection (CI), or normal saline (NS), respectively. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, Flow Cytometry (FCM), enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) and hematological examination were applied to evaluate therapeutic effects and potential toxicity. Results: F18 and F19 were screened out as HELT fractions in vivo and F18-loaded emulsions of different concentrations for lymphatic administration were prepared. We confirmed that HD-E and MD-E produced obvious antitumor activities in footpad tumors and LNM compared with other groups in vitro. We also verified the effects of F18-loaded emulsions on activating hematopoietic function, stimulating proliferation of the spleen and natural killer (NK) cells, and promoting the secretion of IFN-γ and IgG1, although HD-E performed mild toxicity on liver.

Study design: A retrospective study of Swedish women aged 40 years or more on 31 December 2005 (n = 2,863,643), followed through to December 2011. The study analysed three mandatory national healthcare registries: the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, the National Inpatient Register and the Cancer Register. New users were defined as having a first dispensation after at least a 9-month break, and thus were possible to identify from April 2006. New users with at least one of the diagnoses BC, EC or PE before the first dispensation were classified as having a relative or absolute contraindication for HT. Main outcome measures: The relative risks of having HT dispensed after being diagnosed with BC, EC and/or PE. Results: In total, 171,714 women had at least one of the diagnoses BC, EC or PE. The relative risk of having hormone therapy dispensed (current and new users) after being diagnosed with any of the diagnoses was significantly lower (PE, IRR 0.11, 95% CI 0.10–0.12;/ BC, IRR 0.12, 95% CI 0.11–0.13; EC, IRR 0.43, CI 0.40–0.46) than for women without these diagnoses. Conclusions: One in about 250 women started treatment with HT after being diagnosed with BC, PE or EC. Swedish prescribers seem to be well aware of the recommendations for HT use in women with contraindications. A few women, however, are prescribed HT despite having BC, EC or PE, possibly after careful evaluation of the risks and benefits and giving informed consent.

In this study, the breath-hold technique is experimentally investigated for pencil beam scanned (PBS) proton therapy, with respect to the dosimetric effect of residual breath-hold motion. Material and methods: Three-dimensional (3D)-printed tumours extracted from CT scans of three patients were inserted into a dynamic anthropomorphic breathing phantom. The target was set up to move with the individual patient's tumour motion during breath-hold as previously assessed on fluoroscopy. Target dose was measured with radio-chromic film, and both single field uniform dose (SFUD) and intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plans were delivered. Experiments were repeated for each patient without any motion, to compute the relative dose deviation between static and breath-hold cases. Results: SFUD plans showed small dose deviations between static and breath-hold cases, as evidenced by the gamma pass rate (3%, 3 mm) of 85% or higher. Dose deviation was more evident for IMPT plans, with gamma pass rate reduced to 50–70%. Conclusions: The breath-hold technique is robust to residual intra-breath-hold motion for SFUD treatment plans, based on our experimental study.

This study aimed to (i) identify biological pathways that are consistently modulated by Cr(VI) in the lung through the compilation of transcriptomic-based databases, (ii) predict interactions between epigenetic regulators and transcriptional responses, and (iii) relate findings to previous literature to postulate a mechanism of action underlying Cr(VI)-induced lung cancer involving changes in genomic/epigenomic signatures. This cross-study comparison identified 372 genes with Cr(VI)-induced expression alterations in multiple studies. Pathway enrichment analyses of the commonly modulated genes demonstrated that pathways involved in cytotoxicity / cell proliferation were highly enriched, as well as the general suppression of genes involved in DNA damage repair.

Human CC cell line (SiHa) and human normal cervical epithelial cells (H8) were obtained and classified into the normal, blank, negative control (NC), PSMA7-shRNA1, and PSMA7-shRNA2 groups, respectively. In situ hybridization was used to detect the expressions of wild-type and mutant p53 proteins. Immunofluorescence assay was carried out to test the activity of 20S proteasomes. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis were both performed to determine the expressions of PSMA7, ubiquitin, P27, P53, and VEGF in sample tissues and cells. 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to analyze cell proliferation rates, and flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle and the apoptotic rate. Compared with normal tissues, CC tissues showed increased expression levels of PSMA7, ubiquitin, p53, VEGF as well as increased activity of 20S proteasomes but exhibited a decrease in p27 expression. Compared with the blank and NC groups, the PSMA7-shRNA1 and PSMA7-shRNA2 groups all had decreased expression levels of PSMA7, ubiquitin, p53, and VEGF as well as decreased cell proliferation, 20S proteasomes activity, and cell number in the S phase, increased p27 expression, cell apoptosis and cell number in the G0/G1 phase. Our study demonstrated that PSMA7 silencing can suppress CC cell proliferation and VEGF expression in addition to promoting cell apoptosis through inhibiting the UPP signaling pathway. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cervical cancer (CC); proliferation; PSMA7; ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP); vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)",Article,Scopus

Methods: Forty targets in two patient cohorts were evaluated: (1) gantry-based SBRT (deep-inspiratory breath-hold-gating; GS) and (2) robotic SBRT (online fiducial-tracking; RS). The planning-CT was deformably registered to the first post-treatment contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI. An isodose-structure cropped to the liver (ISL) and corresponding to the contoured MMA was created. Structure and statistical analysis regarding volumes, surface-distance, conformity metrics and center-of-mass-differences (CoMD) was performed. Results: Liver volume-reduction was −43.1 ± 148.2 cc post-RS and −55.8 ± 174.3 cc post-GS. The mean surface-distance between MMA and ISL was 2.3 ± 0.8 mm (RS) and 2.8 ± 1.1 mm (GS). ISL and MMA volumes diverged by 5.1 ± 23.3 cc (RS) and 16.5 ± 34.1 cc (GS); the median conformity index of both structures was 0.83 (RS) and 0.80 (GS). The average relative directional errors were ≤0.7 mm (RS) and ≤0.3 mm (GS); the median absolute 3D-CoMD was 3.8 mm (RS) and 4.2 mm (GS) without statistically significant differences between the two techniques. Factors influencing the IVA included GTV and PTV (p = 0.041 and p = 0.020). Four local relapses occurred without correlation to IVA. Conclusions: For the first time a method for IVA was presented, which can serve as a benchmarking-tool for other treatment techniques. Both techniques have shown median deviations <5 mm of planned dose and MMA. However, IVA also revealed treatments with errors ≥5 mm, suggesting a necessity for patient-specific safety-margins.

Accumulating evidence suggests that these functions are primarily exerted through phosphorylation downstream factors such as p53 and BRCA1. Recent studies have shown that ubiquitination is an important mode of regulation of CHK2. However, it remains largely unclear whether deubiquitinases participate in regulation of CHK2. Here, we report that a deubiquitinase, USP39, is a new regulator of CHK2. Mechanistically, USP39 deubiquitinates and stabilizes CHK2, which in turn enhances CHK2 stability. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) mediated knockdown of USP39 led to deregulate CHK2, which resulted in compromising the DNA damage-induced G2/M checkpoint, decreasing apoptosis, and conferring cancer cells resistance to chemotherapy drugs and radiation treatment.

Secondarily, we explored the survival prognostic value of different anatomo-clinical factors in elderly group. Methods: In this retrospective observational multicentre study, we included 134 consecutive CN-mCRPC patients, 64 young and 70 elderly men, who had received AA or Enz. Results: We did not find significant differences in treatment duration [16.6 months, (95% CI 9–24.2 months) vs. 16.8 months (95% CI: 6.3–27.2 months); p = 0.926] and overall survival [median not reached vs. 23.3 months (95% CI 10.2–36.3 months); p = 0.131] between the young and elderly groups.

Logistic regression was used to derive and validate two scoring systems (A and B) for prediction of EC/AH: scoring system A was Doppler score + interrupted endo-myometrial junction (IEJ) (2 points); and scoring system B was Doppler score + IEJ (1 point) + Irregular Endometrial Outline (IESO) by GIS (1 point); the Doppler score was based on the presence of more than one single or double vessel (1 point) + multiple vessels (1 point) + large vessels (1 point). Outcome measures: Diagnostic performance and calibration curves for identification of EC/AH. Results: Both scoring systems had good observer agreement.

Survival from hypercalcemia to death was assessed by Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Univariate log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards modeling were used to develop a risk stratification model. Sixty-five patients were evaluable with a median follow-up of 83.5 months. Mean age was 59.2 years, 64.6% had recurrent disease, and 30.8% had ≥2 previous lines of chemotherapy. Median survival was 38 days. Our analysis identified four risk factors (RFs) [brain metastasis, >1 site of metastasis, serum corrected peak calcium >12.4 (mg/dL), and peak ionized calcium >5.97 (mg/dL)] that predicted survival and were used to build a risk stratification score. Sum of RFs included 35 patients with 1 RF, 11 had 2 RFs, and 19 had ≥3 RF. Median survival for 1, 2, or ≥ 3 RFs was 53, 28, and 26 days respectively (p =.009).

To overcome these difficulties, such as the complexity of the preparation method and lack of good targeting, we used simple polydopamine (PDA) as a pH-sensitive targeting anchor for nanoparticles (NPs). We successfully conjugated folic acid (FA) to the surface of honokiol (HK) nanoparticles coated with PDA using a typical surface modifier. After preparation into HK-PDA-FA-NPs, we characterized the particle size, potential and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The targeted nanoparticles (HK-PDA-FA-NPs) can be stably present in various physiological media and exhibit pH sensitivity during drug release in vitro. HK-PDA-FA-NPs have better targeting ability to 4T1 cells than HK-NPs.

The effect on glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) of mutant p53 R248Q overexpression in HeLa cells (HeLa-M) was analyzed and compared with cells overexpressing wild-type p53 (HeLa-H) and nontransfected cells containing negligible p53 levels (HeLa-L). p53 R248Q overexpression induced early cell detachment during in vitro growth; however, detached HeLa-M cells showed high viability, shorter generation time and significant diminution in the adhesion proteins E-cadherin and β-catenin versus HeLa-H and HeLa-L cells. Under normoxia, a lower growth rate of attached HeLa-M cells correlated with decreased levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α), adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mitochondrial proteins (20–80%) and OxPhos flux (69 ± 12%). On the contrary, HeLa-M also showed increased contents of CDKN1A, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), c-MYC, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α; 1–4 times), glycolytic HIF-1α targets (2–4 times), and glycolysis flux (2-fold) versus HeLa-H. In consequence, glycolysis provided ~70% of the cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in HeLa-M cells under normoxia whereas, OxPhos predominated (65–82%) in HeLa-H and HeLa-L cells. Pifithrin-α, a specific p53 inhibitor, did not alter the p53 R248Q target protein contents and OxPhos and glycolytic fluxes, and a poor HIF-1α-p53 R248Q interaction was attained, in HeLa-M cells. These observations suggested that p53 R248Q deficiently interacted with pifithrin-α and HIF-1α. Therefore, lower mitochondrial biogenesis, deficient HIF-1α/mutant p53 interaction, and development of a pseudohypoxic state under normoxia were the apparent biochemical mechanisms underlying glycolysis activation and OxPhos downregulation in HeLa-M cells. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cancer cells; glycolysis; mutant p53; oxidative phosphorylation",Review,Scopus

Such complexity metric may be used to differentiate between types of tissues. Here, the method is utilized as a binary classifier for the malignancy of breast lesions. The method is tested on OASBUD – an open-access breast lesions image database. Images of 48 malignant and 48 benign lesions were used – two images for each lesion.

Here, we report that epithelial cancer cells are dominant in different development stages of human melanoma tissues. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that maintain melanoma cells in the epithelial state are further investigated in the A2058 cell line. We find that micropore (8 µm) transwell invasion, but not superficial migration in the scratch assay, can induce remarkable morphological changes between epithelial and mesenchymal melanoma cells within 4 days. The morphological switch is associated with dynamic changes of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) hallmarks E-cadherin and vimentin. Further immunoflurencent staining and co-immunoprecipitation assay showed the uncoupling of the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in epithelial melanoma cells. Specific knockdown of M3 mAChR by small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly abrogates the transition of spindle-shaped mesenchymal cells to epithelial cells. Collectively, we report a cellular model of invasiveness-triggered state transition (ITST) in which melanoma cell invasion can induce morphological changes between epithelial and mesenchymal cells. ITST is one of the biological basis for maintaining metastatic melanoma cells in the epithelial state.

In recent years, secondary metabolites of licorice are gaining popularity, especially due to their significant cytotoxic and antitumor effects. However, Glycyrrhiza iconica, an endemic species to Turkey, was not investigated in terms of its anticancer secondary metabolites previously. Purpose: This study aimed to isolate the cytotoxic compounds from G. iconica through bioactivity-guided fractionation and to elucidate mechanisms of action of the most potent compounds. Methods: Total MeOH extract and CHCl 3 , EtOAc, n-buOH and rH 2 O subextracts were prepared from G. iconica roots. Sequential chromatographic techniques were conducted for the isolation studies. The chemical structures of the isolates were established based on NMR and HR-MS analysis. Sulforhodamine B assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxic activity of extracts, main fractions as well as isolates against hepatocellular (Huh7), breast (MCF7) and colorectal (HCT116) cancer cell lines. The mechanisms underlying the cytotoxicity of the most active compounds in Huh7 cells were elucidated by using Hoechst staining, Fluorescence-activated cell sorting and Western blot assays. Results: A new dihydrochalcone, iconichalcone (1) along with 15 known phenolic compounds were isolated from the active CHCl 3 , EtOAc and n-buOH subextracts. Compounds 2–5, 7–16 were found to be responsible for the in vitro cytotoxic activity of G. iconica against all tested cancer cell lines with IC 50 values ranging from 2.4 to 33 µM. Amongst these compounds, licoricidin (10), dehydroglyasperin C (12), iconisoflaven (13) and 1-methoxyficifolinol (15) were found to be the most active compounds according to SRB and real time bioactivity assays and submitted to further mechanistic investigations in Huh7 cells. Compounds 10, 12, 13 and 15 caused accumulation of cells in different phases of cell cycle. Moreover, 10, 12, 13 and 15 induced apoptosis through caspase activation. Besides, 12 showed activation of p53 expression and thus G 2 /M arrest as well as a condensed nuclei, established very promising results.

Aberrant DNA methylation, as the most common and important modification in epigenetics, is an important means of regulating genomic function and can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). In this paper, methylation information and gene expression data from patients with LUSC were extracted from the TCGA database. Univariate and multivariate COX analyses were used to screen abnormally methylated genes related to the prognosis of LUSC. The relationship between key DNA methylation sites and the transcriptional expression of LUSC-related genes was explored. A prognostic risk model constructed by four abnormally methylated genes (VAX1, CH25H, AdCyAP1, and Irx1) was used to predict the prognosis of LUSC patients. Also, the methylation levels of the key gene IRX1 are significantly correlated with the prognosis and correlated with the methylation of the site cg09232937 and cg10530883. This study is based on high-throughput data mining and provides an effective bioinformatics basis for further understanding the pathogenesis and prognosis of LUSC, which has important theoretical significance for follow-up studies on LUSC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","biomarkers; Cox proportional hazards regression; lung squamous cell carcinoma; methylation; survival analysis",Article,Scopus

Thus, depletion of intracellular GSH level is highly desirable for targeted-therapeutic agents to reverse tumor drug resistance.

Upon the irradiation, ZnPc-C 8 -Len could generate ROS to deplete intracellular GSH. The decreased GSH would enhance apoptotic cell death by Bcl-2/caspase 3 pathway and reduce expression of P-gp to reverse lenvatinib resistance.

Current approaches rely on preloaded photosensitizers, where the off/on state of PDT is regulated by the sensitizing light of photosensitizers. However, the photoactivities inevitably occur when imaging/diagnosis or exposure to sunlight, etc. These preloading approaches will cause the damage to normal cells and the photosensitivity to the skin.

In this study, we asked whether activation of AP-1 modifies androgen-responsive gene transcription, and whether androgens effect AP-1-regulated gene transcription. We show that activation of AP-1 via expression of a constitutively active mutant of mitogen-activated/extracellular signal responsive kinase kinase (MEK) kinase-1 did not increase the activity of the androgen-responsive probasin promoter. Likewise, expression of a constitutively active mutant of the transcription factor c-Jun, which is a major constitutent of AP-1, did not increase the activity of the probasin promoter. In contrast, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) activated both the probasin promoter and the AP-1-regulated collagenase promoter in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The AP-1 binding site within the collagenase promoter was identified as DHT-responsive element. In line with this, DHT increased the activities of the c-Jun promoter and the tumor necrosis factor alpha promoter, which both contain AP-1 binding sites. The signal transduction pathway coupling DHT stimulation with AP-1 activation required c-Jun, MAP kinases and androgen receptors, but was independent of transient receptor potential melastatin-8 (TRPM8) channels, proposed to function as ionotropic testosterone receptors. Expression of the GTPase activating protein RGS2 attenuated DHT-induced activation of AP-1, indicating that the DHT-induced signaling cascade involves G proteins. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Androgen receptor; c-Jun; MKP-1; RGS2; TNFα; TRPM8",Article,Scopus

The dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) regulates cytoplasmic MAPK signaling by dephosphorylating and inactivating extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) MAPK. To determine the role of DUSP6 in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, we characterized the intestinal epithelial phenotype of Dusp6 knockout (KO) mice under normal, oncogenic, and proinflammatory conditions. Our results show that loss of Dusp6 increased crypt depth and epithelial cell proliferation without altering colonic architecture. Crypt regeneration capacity was also enhanced, as revealed by ex vivo Dusp6 KO organoid cultures. Additionally, loss of Dusp6 induced goblet cell expansion without affecting enteroendocrine and absorptive cell differentiation. Our data also demonstrate that Dusp6 KO mice were protected from acute dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis, as opposed to wild-type mice. In addition, Dusp6 gene deletion markedly enhanced tumor load in Apc Min/+ mice. Decreased DUSP6 expression by RNA interference in HT29 colorectal cancer cells enhanced ERK1/2 activation levels and promoted both anchorage-independent growth in soft agar as well as invasion through Matrigel. Finally, DUSP6 mRNA expression in human colorectal tumors was decreased in advanced stage tumors compared with paired normal tissues. These results demonstrate that DUSP6 phosphatase, by controlling ERK1/2 activation, regulates colonic inflammatory responses, and protects the intestinal epithelium against oncogenic stress. © 2018 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of dose de-escalated RT (DDRT) vs. standard dose RT (SDRT) in patients with HPV-positive OPSCC. Methods: This was an observational study using the National Cancer Database (Year 2010–2014) to identify patients who had HPV-positive OPSCC and were treated with definitive RT or chemo-RT. Patients undergoing surgery were excluded. Patients receiving ≥50 Gy, but <66 Gy were categorized as receiving DDRT. Patients receiving ≥66 Gy were categorized as receiving SDRT. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using propensity scores was used to balance the two groups. Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to estimate overall survival (OS). Subset analyses in patients receiving RT alone and concurrent chemo-RT were also performed. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to evaluate factors associated with OS. Results: 759 patients with HPV-positive OPSCC were identified: 104 received DDRT and 655 received SDRT. The median follow-up was 30.5 (2.4–81.4) months. After IPTW-adjusted analysis, there was no difference in the 3-yr OS between the two groups (82.2% vs. 79.3%; P = 0.85). In the subset of patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy, IPTW-adjusted analysis also did not show a difference in the 3-yr OS between the two groups (83.1% vs. 79.6%; P = 0.83). On multivariable analysis, DDRT was not associated with an inferior OS (HR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.53–1.47; P = 0.63).

Outcome data in this population after a laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy and Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (LRS-IPAA) are limited. We reviewed our experience to determine if younger children would have similar functional outcomes. Methods: After institutional review board approval, a review of children with FAP and UC undergoing LRS-IPAA at a children's hospital from 2002 to 2017 occurred. The study groups were defined based on age: young group (YG; 5-12 y) and older group (OG; 13-18 y). Data points included demographics, postprocedure course, and outcomes. Statistical analysis was performed. Results: Sixty-five children were identified and grouped by age: YG (n = 22, average age 9 y) and OG (n = 43, average age 15.4 y). Thirteen children in YG had UC, and nine had FAP. Twenty-eight children in OG were diagnosed with UC, and 15 with FAP. After LRS-IPAA, continence, appetite recovery, and use of antidiarrheal medications were not significantly different between groups. The incidence of pouch stricture, diagnosis of pouchitis, and complications were also not significantly different. Two children (YG), aged 11 and 12 y at the time of colectomy, were initially diagnosed with UC and then reassigned as having Crohn's disease because of persistent symptoms. One child, who underwent colectomy at 17 y for FAP, had invasive rectal cancer and died 3 y later from metastatic disease. Time of follow-up for OG is 8-61 mo (average: 37 mo). Period of follow-up for YG is 11-73 mo (average: 43 mo). Conclusions: There are no significant differences in the functional outcomes between groups after LRS-IPAA. Although numbers are small, these data suggest younger age should not be a deterrent when contemplating LRS-IPAA in the treatment of UC and FAP in the pediatric population. Younger patients with FAP may benefit from early intervention. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ileal pouch anal anastomosis; Ileostomy; J pouch; Pediatric; Restorative proctocolectomy; Ulcerative colitis",Article,Scopus

The crystal structures of the complexes 1–3 have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods. The compounds, (1) and (3), crystallized in the monoclinic crystal system with C2/c space group. In both complexes, the metal centers are four–coordinated in a distorted tetrahedral configuration by two sulfur atoms from two thiosemicarbazone ligands and two Cl anions. The crystal structure of (2) consists of monomeric entities where the nickel(II) ion exhibit distorted square planar geometry. The coordination geometry around nickel ion is four–coordinate with four atoms of the two chelating thiosemicarbazone ligands which are in cis position. The τ 4 value of 0.255 obtained from the τ 4 analysis of complex (2) shows that the four–coordinate geometry around the central nickel ion is close to square planar. Complex (4) is mononuclear, the central ion is coordinated through the sulfur and the azomethine nitrogen atom of neutral ligand. The cytotoxic effects of all complexes were analyzed for three cancer cell lines, Caco-2, DLD-1, and SW620 compared to normal colon epithelial cell line, CCD18Co. Complex (4) is more active against DLD-1, SW620 and Caco-2 than CCD18Co. The efficiency of complex (4) is more effective in aggressive cancer cell lines.

Sapylin is a drug used to reduce seroma formation and enhance wound closure, but these results remain controversial. We aimed to investigate the potential mechanism. Methods: A prospective, consecutive cohort study included 120 patients diagnosed with breast cancer who underwent modified radical mastectomy was designed. Patients were randomized into two group, using or not using OK-432 (sixty patients per group) during surgeries. Patients’ drainage fluids were collected for three days after surgery. Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were measured with ELISA assays. The proliferative, migratory, and angiogenic capacity of HUVEC and HFL1 cells HUVEC and HFL1 cells were measured after being treated with drainage fluids. Results: Our clinic data showed that there was no statistical significance between the two groups in patient characteristics before surgery. However, the outcomes of patients in experimental group were significantly better than those in control group. In vitro studies, the results of ELISA assays showed that several cytokines, including IL-1a, IL-6, TGF-β1, bFGF and VEGF were increased in the drainage fluids treated with Sapylin. The proliferative, migratory, and angiogenic capacity of HUVEC and HFL1 cells were significantly enhanced after being treated with Sapylin group drainage fluids. Conclusion: Sapylin could stimulate the body to secrete a variety of cytokines to promote wound healing by promoting endothelial cell proliferation and migration, angiogenesis and by increasing fibroblast migration and collagen deposition. © 2019 The Authors","Breast Cancer; Cytokines; Sapylin; Wound Healing",Article,Scopus

FRA16D is a hot spot of genomic instability, prone to breakage and for causing germline and somatic copy number variations (CNVs). Consequentially WWOX is frequent target for deletions in cancer. Esophageal, stomach, colon, bladder, ovarian, and uterine cancers are those most commonly affected by WWOX deep focal deletions. WWOX deletions significantly correlate with various clinicopathological features in esophageal carcinoma. WWOX is also a common target for translocations in multiple myeloma. By mapping R-loop (RNA:DNA hybrid) forming sequences (RFLS) we observe this to be a consistent feature aligning with germline and somatic CNV break points at the edges and core of FRA16D spanning from introns 5 to 8 of WWOX. Germline CNV polymorphisms affecting WWOX are extremely common in humans across different ethnic groups. Importantly, structural variants datasets allowed us to identify a specific hot spot for germline duplications and deletions within intron 5 of WWOX coinciding with the 5′ edge of the FRA16D core and various RFLS. Recently, multiple pathogenic CNVs spanning WWOX have been identified associated with neurological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, infantile epileptic encephalopathies, and other developmental anomalies. Loss of WWOX function has recently been associated with DNA damage repair abnormalities, increased genomic instability, and resistance to chemoradiotherapy. The described observations place WWOX both as a target of and a contributor to genomic instability.

In our earlier xenograft animal experiments, progesterone did not stimulate breast tumors. The aim of this study was to test dydrogesterone for the first time. The study also evaluated the effects of PGRMC1 on proliferation with progestogens. Methods (1): In-vitro study. The proliferative effects of dydrogesterone and of progesterone were assessed in vitro using T47D cells transfected with PGRMC1 or empty vector in the presence or absence of estradiol. Additionally, to find the strongest proliferator for inclusion as a comparator in the xenograft animal study, norethisterone, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, dienogest, drospirenone, nomegestrol, and cyproterone acetate were tested. Methods (2): Xenograft main study. PGRMC1-transfected or empty-vector T47D and MCF7 xenotransplants were each treated with four different hormonal preparations: E2+placebo; E2+dydrogesterone; E2+progesterone; E2+norethisterone. A total of 112 castrated mice were randomly allocated to the 16 groups. This was thus a prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled four-arm study (45–50 days) with the two T47D and two MCF7 xenografts. Tumor volumes were monitored twice weekly. Results (1): In-vitro study. The strongest proliferation was with norethisterone, but only with PGRMC1-transfected cells. There was significant proliferation with dydrogesterone, but not with progesterone in the absence of estradiol. However, no increase in proliferation was achieved by adding dydrogesterone to estradiol compared with the proliferation induced with estradiol alone, in contrast to norethisterone. Results (2): Xenograft main study. There was significantly faster tumor growth with norethisterone + E2 than with E2+placebo in T47D and MCF7 PGRMC1 xenografts, but not with dydrogesterone + E2 or progesterone + E2. There was less tumor growth in empty-vector xenografts, without between-group differences. Conclusion: PGRMC1 increases the breast-cell proliferation effects of certain progestogens, including dydrogesterone, in contrast to progesterone, but not during estradiol-induced proliferation, either in vitro or in a xenograft animal model, in contrast to norethisterone. Thus the proliferative potency of dydrogesterone may be similar to that of progesterone.

Methods: A randomized, double-blind, no-treatment parallel control clinical trial involving 140 perioperative patients (90 men and 50 women, aged 40–75 y) with CRC was performed. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: an intervention group (prebiotic group, n = 70) that received prebiotic supplementation of 30 g/d for 7 d, and a control group (non-prebiotic group, n = 70) that received no prebiotic supplementation. The nutritional and immunologic indices were evaluated for both groups before and after operation and analyzed against baseline values. Moreover, fecal samples were collected from 40 patients randomly chosen from the two groups to study intestinal microbiota, which was analyzed by sequencing the V3–V4 region of 16S ribosomal DNA using the Illumina (San Diego, CA) MiSeq (PE 2 × 300 bp) platform. Results: Oral intake of prebiotics produced significant effects on immunologic indices in both the preoperative and postoperative periods, but the patterns of effects were different. In the preoperative period, prebiotics increased serum levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG; P = 0.02), IgM (P = 0.00), and transferrin (P = 0.027; all P &lt; 0.05). In the postoperative period, enhanced levels of IgG (P = 0.003), IgA (P = 0.007), suppressor/cytotoxic T cells (CD3 + CD8 + ; P = 0.043), and total B lymphocytes (CD19 + ; P = 0.012) were identified in the prebiotic group (all P &lt; 0.05). The differences in the intestinal microbiota at the phylum level were not statistically significant between the intervention and control groups (P &gt; 0.05). At the genus level, prebiotics increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium (P = 0.017) and Enterococcus (P = 0.02; both P &lt; 0.05) but decreased the abundance of Bacteroides (P = 0.04) in the preoperative period (all P &lt; 0.05). In the postoperative period, the abundance of Bacteroides (P = 0.04) was decreased, but the abundance of Enterococcus (P = 0.00), Bacillus (P = 0.01), Lactococcus (P = 0.00), and Streptococcus (P = 0.037) increased in the non-prebiotic group (all P &lt; 0.05); however, no significant change was identified in the abundance of Enterococcus (P = 0.56), Lactococcus (P = 0.07), and Streptococcus (P = 0.56) as a result of prebiotic intervention in this period (all P &gt; 0.05). The abundance of Escherichia-Shigella was increased after prebiotic intake in the postoperative period (P = 0.014, P &lt; 0.05). There was a notable trend of decline in the abundance of intestinal microbiota from preoperative to postoperative in the non-prebiotic group. Conclusions: Prebiotic intake is recommended to improve serum immunologic indicators in patients with CRC 7 d before operation. Prebiotics improved the abundance of four commensal microbiota containing opportunistic pathogens in patients with CRC. Surgical stress decreased the abundance of most intestinal microbiota in the intestinal tract but increased the abundance of some opportunistic pathogens and commensal microbiota. Bacteroides is a relevant bacterial species for further research on the mechanism of prebiotics. © 2018 The Authors","Colorectal cancer; Immune system; Intestinal microbiota; Operation; Prebiotics",Article,Scopus

We report here the final results of the study. Patients and methods: Patients with histopathologically confirmed LARC (cT3-T4, any N) were eligible. They received oral S-1 (80 mg/m 2 /day on days 1–5, 8–12, 22–26, and 29–33) and infusional oxaliplatin (60 mg/m 2 /day on days 1, 8, 22, 29) plus radiotherapy (1.8 Gy/day, total dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions), with a chemotherapy gap in the third week of radiotherapy. Primary endpoint of the study was pathological complete response (pCR) rate. Secondary endpoints were rates of R0 resection, down-staging, cumulative 3-year local recurrence, 3-year disease-free survival (DFS), and toxicity. Results: Forty-five patients were enrolled at six centers in Japan. All patients received CRT, and 44 underwent operation. The pCR rate was 27.3% (12/44). The R0 resection rate was 95.5% (42/44). T-down-staging rate was 59.1% (26/44), and N-down staging rate was 65.9% (29/44); the combined pathological down-staging rate was 79.5% (35/44). There were no grade 4 adverse events, but 11.1% of the patients had grade 3 adverse events. Cumulative 3-year local recurrence rate was 0%. However, 13 (30.0%) patients suffered from distant metastasis, and one patient suffered from secondary esophageal cancer that was unrelated to rectal cancer. Eight patients had lung metastasis, 4 had liver metastasis, and 3 patients died of the metastatic disease. The 3-year DFS rate of the 44 patients was 67.5% (median follow-up 36.3 months), and the 3-year overall survival (OS) rate was 93.0% (median follow-up 39.6 months). The patients were then divided into the pCR (12 patients) group and non pCR (32 patients) group. The 3-year rate of DFS for each group was 91.7% and 58.1% and that of OS was 100% and 90.3%, respectively. Conclusions: The study showed a high pCR rate with no severe toxicity, good follow-up results, and good loco-regional control. Therefore, addition of oxaliplatin to preoperative CRT with S-1 in patients with LARC might be feasible and lead to better local control than standard treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Locally advanced rectal carcinoma; Long-term outcome; Neoadjuvant rectal (NAR) score; Oxaliplatin; Preoperative chemoradiotherapy; S-1",Article,Scopus

However, segmenting the tumor in BUS images is often challenging due to several artifacts that degrade the quality of ultrasound images. In this study, a new two-phase method is proposed to enable automatic and accurate segmentation of BUS images by decomposing the image into superpixels with high boundary recall ratio and employing edge- and region-based information to outline the tumor. The first phase of the method obtains an initial outline of the tumor by decomposing the BUS image into coarse superpixels to enable effective estimation of their tumor likelihoods and employing a customized graph cuts algorithm to segment the superpixels. The segmentation of the superpixels is carried out using edge-based information that quantifies the image contour cue and region-based information that characterizes the texture content of the superpixels. In the second phase, the tumor outline is improved by decomposing the BUS image into fine superpixels that enable high boundary recall ratio and employing the customized graph cuts algorithm to segment the superpixel located around the initial tumor outline. Furthermore, an edge-based active contour model is used to smooth the tumor outline. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using a database that includes 160 BUS images (86 benign and 74 malignant). The results indicate that the first phase of the proposed method was able to detect the tumor in all BUS images and obtain mean values of the true positive ratio (TPR), false positive ratio (FPR), false negative ratio (FNR), similarity ratio (SIR), Hausdorff error (HE), and mean absolute error (ME) equal to 91.68, 11.16, 8.32, 84.52, 17.59, and 4.67, respectively. In fact, the results obtained by the first phase of the proposed method outperform four existing BUS image segmentation algorithms. Moreover, the second phase of the proposed method was able to improve the tumor outlines of the first phase and achieve mean TPR, FPR, FNR, SIR, HE, and ME values of 96.04, 7.99, 3.96, 91.41, 11.66, and 3.65, respectively. These results suggest the feasibility of employing the proposed method, which enables automatic and accurate tumor segmentation in BUS images, to develop effective CAD systems for breast cancer. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Active contour models; Breast cancer diagnosis; Graph cuts segmentation; Superpixels; Support vector machine; Ultrasound breast images",Article,Scopus

However, effective detection of CNVs from whole genome next generation sequencing data (NGS) remains challenging. Here, we present BagGMM, a new method to call CNVs using tumor-normal matched samples from NGS data. BagGMM extracts read depth ratios of tumor samples to normal samples, divides the genomic sequences into segments by sliding windows to count the average coverage ratio of each segment, filters candidate deletions and duplications based on a coarse criterion of coverage ratio, and then builds Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for remaining ratios to identify the remaining ambiguous copy number states after filtration. Bagging multiple GMMs makes false positive calls descent instead of using one GMM, thus enhancing the detection power of BagGMM. Considering the computation speed of GMMs and false positive calls, we employ a segmentation procedure “large window and then small windows”, which is also helpful to determine boundary of CNV regions. We apply BagGMM to three simulation datasets and two groups of human whole genome sequencing (WGS) data for breast cancer patients and ovarian cancer patients to identify CNVs, respectively. All performed experiments demonstrate that BagGMM has the capability of robustly identification of CNVs with different sizes and states. The performance of this tool is compared to four peer existing CNV detection methods. BagGMM shows a significant improvement in both sensitivity and specificity for detecting both copy number gains and losses. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Copy number variation; Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM); Next generation sequencing; Read depth; Whole-genome sequencing",Article,Scopus

Advancement of AFM technology enables studying living cells and differentiating cancer cell from normal cells based on topography and NPs. Though the trend overlaps from different literature; numerical values of nanomechanical readouts depict variations over a wide range. These anomalies are associated with the experimental setup under study. In this manuscript, we have identified heterogeneity in cell culture system in addition to the selection of AFM probe with specific tip geometry as the major contributors to the above mentioned anomalies. To test our hypothesis, we have used Panc1 cells, which is a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell type. Our results suggest that the cellular morphology, membrane roughness and NPs calculated from AFM study are distinctly influenced by cell cycle. Furthermore, we found that the NPs readout is also significantly associated with AFM tip geometries. The cells were found to be softer in their early resting phase when indented with pyramidal probe and became increasingly stiffer as they progressed through the cell cycles. On the contrary, when indented with the spherical probe, cells in G0/G1 phase were observed to be the stiffest. Such an exhaustive study of the role of cell cycle in influencing the NPs in Panc1 cell line along with the impact of tip geometry on NPs is the first of its kind, to the best of our knowledge. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Atomic force microscopy; Cell cycle; Nanoindentation; Pancreatic cancer; Young's modulus",Article,Scopus

For each association, random-effects summary effect size, 95% confidence interval (CI), and 95% prediction interval were calculated. To evaluate the credibility of the identified evidence, we assessed also heterogeneity, evidence for small-study effect and evidence for excess significance bias. Twenty-one relevant meta-analyses were identified reporting on 50 different outcomes. The level of evidence was high only for the association of short telomeres with higher risk of gastric cancer in the general population (relative risk, RR = 1.95, 95%CI: 1.68–2.26), and moderate for the association of shorter telomeres with diabetes or with Alzheimer's disease, even if limited to meta-analyses of case-control studies. There was weak evidence for twenty outcomes and not significant association for 27 health outcomes.

In the present work, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with folate (FA)-modified polyethylenimine (PEI-FA) were prepared by a single step method (without additional reducing agent) for targeted gene transfection in tumor cells. Moreover, an improved compound vector system was developed by mixing PEI-AuNPs and PEI-FA-AuNPs.

Firstly, it is paramount to warrant the correct, fair and timely treatment access. We found that disease modifying drugs (DMDs) access is highly variable among different countries and even different regions within a country. In this sense less than 35% of MS patients in Latin American have access to treatment. Secondly, adherence depends on some characteristics such as the way of administration, treatment length and side effects, among others. Finally, chronic immune suppression has become a common consequence of most DMDs. Hence, the different mechanisms of action and their safety profile should be taken carefully into consideration when choosing a specific drug. These three areas of interest related to a single medication, adherence, access to it and mechanism of action, are of utmost importance when trying to achieve effectiveness instead of just efficacy. © 2019","Barriers; Burden of MS; Disease modifying drugs; Latin America; Multiple sclerosis",Review,Scopus

High drug content of 25.4% was achieved for the final PEG-PGMA-Hy-DOX prodrug microspheres with average hydrodynamic diameter of 332 nm. The in vitro controlled release showed leakage-free in physiological medium but a sustained drug release up to 58% within 56 h in tumor intracellular microenvironment. The cellular experiments showed that the PEG-PGMA-Hy-DOX prodrug microspheres could be effectively internalized into HepG2 cells with enhanced anti-tumor efficacy than the free DOX.

However, pre-hydration may also have systemic effects, potentially leading to lower tumour cisplatin concentrations. We investigated the impact of pre-hydration on tumour cisplatin concentrations in mice, and on treatment outcomes in a clinical cohort study. Materials and methods: Four groups of 20 mice received either no pre-hydration prior to full-dose (6 mg/kg) or half-dose cisplatin, overnight dehydration prior to full-dose cisplatin (dehydration), or NaCl intraperitoneally prior to full-dose cisplatin (pre-hydration). Kidney function and tumour platinum concentration were measured. In patients, a retrospective study compared 2 historical NSCLC cohorts which received CCRT with daily cisplatin, with and without standard pre-hydration. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were compared using Kaplan–Meier and cox-regression. Results: Pre-hydration significantly decreased cisplatin tumour concentrations in mice, comparable to mice receiving half the dose. In 419 patients (211 without and 208 with pre-hydration) with median follow-up 22 months, there were no significant differences in PFS (18 vs. 15 months) or OS (23 vs. 23 months).

Materials and methods: The COMMAND VTE Registry is a retrospective multicenter registry enrolling 3027 consecutive patients with acute symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) in Japan. The current study population included 2498 patients with upper or lower extremities DVT. Results: There were 74 patients (3.0%) with upper extremities DVT and 2424 patients with lower extremities DVT. Patients with upper extremities DVT more often had active cancer (58%) and central venous catheter use (22%). The proportion of concomitant pulmonary embolism at diagnosis was lower in patients with upper extremities DVT than in those with lower extremities DVT (14% and 51%, P < 0.001). Discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy was more frequent in patients with upper extremities DVT (63.8% and 29.8% at 1-year, P < 0.001). The cumulative 3-year incidence of recurrent VTE was not different between the 2 groups (9.8% and 7.4%, P = 0.43). After adjusting confounders, the risks of upper extremities DVT relative to lower extremities DVT for recurrent VTE remained insignificant (HR 0.94, 95%CI 0.36–2.01, P = 0.89). Conclusions: The prevalence of patients with DVT in upper extremities was 3.0% in the current large-scale real-world registry. Patients with DVT in upper extremities more often had active cancer at diagnosis and central venous catheter use as a transient risk factor for VTE, and less often had concomitant PE. Patients with DVT in upper extremities had similar long-term risk for recurrent VTE as those with DVT in lower extremities despite shorter duration of anticoagulation. © 2019","Bleeding; Deep vein thrombosis; Mortality; Recurrence; Upper",Article,Scopus

Materials/Methods: Nodal disease at diagnosis (N−, N+) and nodal failure were analysed per region (NF) (pelvic (parametrial, common iliac, internal/external iliac), inguinal and para-aortic (PAO)) in 1338 patients. Treatment consisted of chemo-radiation and MRI guided brachytherapy. PAO radiotherapy and/or nodal boost was left to the treating centre. At time of diagnosis 52% of patients had pathologic nodes. Frequency analyses were performed in relation to patient, primary tumour and nodal disease characteristics, and treatment related factors. Results: Median follow up was 34 months and 83% of NF occurred within 24 months. At diagnosis 99% of the N+ patients had pathologic nodes in the pelvis and 14% in the PAO. NF pelvic and NF PAO were reported in 55% and 68% of patients with NF, respectively. Overall NF was reported in 152 patients (11%); 7 and 16% for N- and N+ patients.

Current evidence indicates that ribavirin-associated teratogenicity is not significant in humans, but more information about the developmental toxicity and mechanisms involved in ribavirin placental kinetics is required to assure its safe use in pregnancy. Thus, we have investigated potential roles of equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs, SLC29A), Na + -dependent influx-mediating concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNTs, SLC28A), and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux pumps, in ribavirin placental pharmacokinetics. Our data indicate that ENT1 participates in uptake of ribavirin by BeWo cells, fresh human placental villous fragments and microvillous plasma membrane (MVM) vesicles while activity of CNTs (probably CNT2) was only observed in BeWo cells. In situ dual perfusion experiments with rat term placenta in an open circuit setup showed that ENT inhibition significantly decreases total ribavirin maternal-to-foetal and foetal-to-maternal clearances. In contrast, no contribution of ABC transporters, p-glycoprotein (ABCB1), breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2), or multidrug resistance-associated protein (ABCC2) was detected in assays with MDCKII cells overexpressing them, or in closed circuit dual perfusion experiments with rat term placenta. In summary, our data show that ribavirin placental pharmacokinetics are largely controlled by ENT1 activity and independent of ABCB1, ABCG2, and ABCC2 efflux pumps. © 2019","ABC transporters; Nucleoside transporters; Placenta; Pregnancy; Ribavirin",Article,Scopus

Methods and materials: This retrospective study considered 17 patients with liver tumors who underwent feedback-guided BH (FGBH) IMRT treatment with daily CT-on-rail imaging. Planning CT images were acquired at simulation using FGBH, and FGBH CT-on-rail images were also acquired prior to each treatment. Selective robust IMPT plans were generated using planning CT and re-calculated on each daily CT-on-rail image. Subsequently, the fractional doses were deformed and accumulated onto the planning CT according to the deformable image registration between daily and planning CTs. The doses to the target and organs at risk (OARs) were compared between IMRT, planned IMPT, and accumulated IMPT doses. Results: For IMPT plans, the mean of D 98% of CTV for all 17 patients was slightly reduced from the planned dose of 68.90 ± 1.61 Gy to 66.48 ± 1.67 Gy for the accumulated dose. The target coverage could be further improved by adjusting planning techniques. The dose–volume histograms of both planned and accumulated IMPT doses showed better sparing of OARs than that of the IMRT.

This study was designed to identify specific lncRNAs correlating to liver metastasis of CRC, and to further assess their clinical value. Seventeen patients with primary CRC lesions, adjacent normal mucosa, and synchronous liver metastases lesions were divided into discovery set (six patients) and test set (11 patients). Transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) was used to screen differential expression of lncRNAs in the discovery set. Based on bioinformatics data, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to verify the target lncRNA in test set. The relationships between target lncRNA and clinical values were analysed in an expanded validation set of additional 91 patients. 23 upregulated and 14 downregulated lncRNAs were detected for distinguishing synchronous liver metastases, primary CRC lesions from adjacent normal mucosa in the RNAseq set. The expression levels of four lncRNAs in the 37 lncRNA signature were verified by qRT-PCR in the test set. Compared with the paired normal mucosa, high expression levels of lnc-small-nucleolar RNA host gene 15 (SNHG15) were detected not only in primary CRC lesions but also in liver metastases lesions in the test set. Furthermore, in the expanded validation set, high expression of lnc-SNHG15 was significantly associated with lymph-node metastasis and liver metastasis (p < 0.05), and patients displaying high lncRNA-SNHG15 expression exhibited a shorter median overall survival duration than those displaying low expression (30.7 vs. 35.2 months; p = 0.003). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that lncRNA-SNHG15 overexpression may serve as a poor prognostic biomarker for CRC patients (p = 0.049; Cox's regression: 2.731). Lnc-SNHG15 overexpression was significantly associated with CLM and high-expression of lnc-SNHG15 in CRC was an independent predictor of poor survival. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","colorectal liver metastasis; lncRNA-SHNG15; long noncoding RNA",Article,Scopus

Complexes were characterized by X-ray analysis and EPR spectroscopy. Complexes 1–3 are monomeric, six-coordinate and crystallize in a monoclinic space group. Interaction of Cu(II) complexes with DNA was studied by means of absorption titrations, viscosity measurements and gel electrophoresis. The relative ability of the complexes to cleave DNA even in the absence of hydrogen peroxide is in the order 3 &gt; 2 &gt; 1. Application of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers, L-histidine, DMSO and SOD confirmed that singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radicals (Fenton reaction) and superoxide radical were formed, respectively. Thus, in addition to mechanism of intercalation, redox-cycling mechanism which in turn lead to the formation of ROS contribute to DNA damage. Cu(II) complexes exhibit excellent SOD-mimetic activity in the order 3~1 &gt; 2. The fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that albumin may act as a targeted drug delivery vehicle for Cu(II) complexes (K~10 6 ). The anticancer activities of complexes 1–3 were investigated using an MTS assay (reduction of the tetrazolium compound) against three cancer cell lines (HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma, HeLa and T-47D breast cancer cells) and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). The most promising compound, from the viewpoint of its NSAID biological activity is 3, due to the presence of the three fluorine atoms participating in the formation of weak hydrogen-bonds at the DNA surface. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Anticancer activity; Cu complexes; Intercalation; NSAID, Phenanthroline; SOD activity",Article,Scopus

Although nephrotoxicity of CP was the main complication, cardiotoxicity has been reported. Objectives: This study investigates the protective role of green tea extract (GTE) and vitamin E (Vit-E) against CP-induced cardiotoxicity, and assesses their impact on CP antitumor efficacy. Materials and Methods: Forty-eight male albino Balb/c mice were randomly divided into six groups, 8 per/group (Gp) were included. Gp1 served as control; Gp2 and Gp3 received oral GTE (400 mg/kg) and Vit-E (100 mg/kg) for 30 consecutive days respectively. Gp4 had received CP (7 mg/kg i.p.) once on the 27th day; Gp5 had received GTE (400 mg/kg p.o.) for 30 days and CP (7 mg/kg i.p.) on the 27th day. Gp6 had received Vit-E (100 mg/kg p.o.) for 30 days and CP (7 mg/kg i.p.) on the 27th day. Blood and tissues samples were harvested for biochemical and histopathological investigations. To evaluate the effect of GTE and Vit-E on the antitumor efficacy of CP, 49 female albino mice were inoculated intraperitoneally by Ehrlich ascetic carcinoma -cells (2 × 10 6 /mouse) then treated with none, corn oil, CP, CP/GTE, CP/Vit-E, GTE or Vit-E. Results: CP injection significantly increased Troponin I, CPK, CK-MB, malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitric oxide (NO) levels, while glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase levels were significantly reduced with disruption of cardiac muscle fibers, loss of striations, absence of intercalated disc, and the nuclei are pyknotic. Treatment with GTE and Vit-E improve the biochemical and histological parameters. Treatment with CP alone led to eradication of the tumor cells from the tumor-bearing mice. However, co-administration of GTE or Vit-E orally with CP did not interfere with its therapeutic effects. Conclusion: Treatment with GTE and Vit-E significantly ameliorated the CP cardiotoxicity and improved the myocardial histopathological architecture. GTE and Vit-E may be combined with CP to alleviate cardiotoxicity in cancer chemotherapy without interfering with its antitumor activity. © 2019","Antitumor activity; Cardiotoxicity; Chemotherapy; Efficacy; Oxidative stress",Article,Scopus

Segmentation is achieved by a local active contour algorithm, integrated and optimized with the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification method, which takes advantage of the stratified k-fold cross-validation strategy. The proposed approach is evaluated considering the delineation of cancers located in different body districts (i.e. brain, head and neck, and lung), and considering different PET radioactive tracers. Data are pre-processed in order to be expressed in terms of standardized uptake value, the most widely used PET quantification index. The algorithm uses an initial, operator selected region containing the lesion, and automatically identifies an operator-independent optimal region of interest around the tumor. Successively, a slice-by-slice marching local active contour segmentation algorithm is used. The key novelty of the proposed approach consists of a novel form of the energy to be minimized during segmentation, which is enhanced by incorporating the information provided by a KNN classifier. The delineation process and its termination are fully automatic, so that intervention from the user is reduced to a minimum. Due to the high level of automation, the final segmented lesion is independent of inter-operator variation in the initial user input, making the entire process robust and the result completely repeatable. In order to assess the performance under different contrast ratio scenarios, we first evaluate the proposed method on five phantom datasets. Next, we assess the applicability of the method in the radiotherapy environment by investigating fifty clinical cases and two different PET radio-tracers. Our investigation shows that the proposed method can be applied in clinical settings and produces accurate and operator-independent segmentations, attaining good accuracy in realistic conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Active contour algorithm; Biological target volume; Cancer segmentation; FDG and MET PET imaging; K-nearest neighbor",Article,Scopus

CFSs nest within very large genes and display cell-type-dependent instability. Fragile or not, large genes tend to replicate late in S-phase. A number of data now show that transcription perturbs replication completion across the body of large genes, particularly upon replication stress. However, the molecular mechanisms by which transcription elicits such under-replication and subsequent instability remain unclear. We present here our view of the mechanisms responsible for CFS under-replication and those allowing the cells to cope with this problem in G2 and mitosis. We notably focus on the major role played by the FANC proteins in the protection of CFSs from S phase up to late mitosis.

We report on the patterns of failure following proton beam therapy (PBT) for H&amp;N RMS. Methods: Forty-six H&amp;N RMS patients were enrolled on a prospective registry protocol between 2006 and 2015. All were treated with a combination of chemotherapy (ChT) and PBT. Most patients (25 patients, 54%) had parameningeal tumors, of which 11 (24%) had intracranial extension (ICE). Thirteen patients (28%) had primary tumors greater than 5 cm. Median total cyclophosphamide (CPM) equivalent dose was 13.2 g/m 2 (range 0–16.8 g/m 2 ). Median RT dose was 50.4 Gy(RBE) (range 36 Gy[RBE]–50.8 Gy[RBE]). Results: With median follow-up of 3.9 years, five-year overall survival was 76%, and five-year progression-free survival was 57%. Seventeen patients (37%) experienced relapse, including 7 with local failure (LF). Five-year local control (LC) was 84%. Tumor size greater than 5 cm predicted increased risk of LF (hazard ratio [HR] 6.49, p = 0.03), as did the presence of ICE at diagnosis (HR 5.21, p = 0.03). Six relapses occurred in patients with ICE; all included a component of central nervous system relapse, with leptomeningeal disease and/or LF with an intracranial component. Delayed RT delivery after week 4 of ChT predicted increased risk of relapse for ICE patients (HR 10.49, p = 0.006). Conclusions: PBT confers excellent LC, and a favorable late toxicity profile as compared with prior photon RT data. Our observations support ongoing trial efforts to dose-escalate RT for patients with larger tumors. However, these data raise concerns regarding excess failures among patients with ICE. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cyclophosphamide; Intracranial extension; Parameningeal; Proton beam therapy; Radiotherapy; Rhabdomyosarcoma",Article,Scopus

However, its mechanism of action was unknown. In this study we characterize the cell signaling events mediating the TRPV2 suppressive activity in FLS invasiveness. Studies with FLS cell lines derived from patients with RA revealed that TRPV2-specific stimulation significantly reduced FLS adhesion to different extracellular matrices that shared binding to αν β1 and β3 integrins. Localization of these integrins to the plasma membrane and numbers of thick and organized actin filaments were diminished by TRPV2 specific stimulation, and cells developed a round and non-polarized morphology. TRPV2 stimulation significantly reduced levels of activated RhoA, Rac1 and cofilin. RhoA activators were able to overcome the TRPV2-induced suppression on both RhoA activation and invasion. These new discoveries suggest that TRPV2 regulates key intracellular processes implicated in cell invasion in arthritis and other processes such as cancer, and has the potential to become a useful target for drug development. © 2019","Ion channel; Rheumatoid arthritis; Small rho GTPase; TRPV2",Article,Scopus

Cell cycle analysis showed that the representative compound 8a led to cell cycle cessation at G0/G1 phase indicating that CDK2/E1complex could be the plausible biological target for these newly synthesized compounds. Thus, the most active compounds (7c and 8a-c) were tested for their CDK2 inhibitory activity. The biological results revealed their significant CDK2 inhibitory activity with IC 50 range of 0.022–1.629 nM. Moreover, RT-PCR gene expression assay showed that compound 8a increased the levels of the nuclear CDK2 regulators P21 and P27 by 2.30 and 5.7 folds, respectively. ELISA tequnique showed also that compound 8a led to remarkable activation of caspases-9 and -3 inducing cell apoptosis. QSAR study showed that the charge distribution and molecular hydrophobicity are the structural features affecting cytotoxic activity in this series. Molecular docking study for the most potent cytotoxic compounds (7c and 8a-c) rationalized their superior CDK2 inhibitory activity through their hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with the key amino acids in the CDK2 binding site. Pharmacokinetic properties prediction of the most potent compounds showed that the newly synthesized compounds are not only with promising antitumor activity but also possess promising pharmacokinetic properties. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","2-Aminothiazole; CDK2 enzyme; Cell cycle arrest; HeLa cell line; Molecular docking; QSAR",Article,Scopus

Methods: We conducted an epigenome-wide association study on 611 adults free of diagnosed disease, living in Italy and Sweden, in whom we also measured plasma concentrations of 6 PCB congeners, DDE and hexachlorobenzene. Results: We identified 650 CpG sites whose methylation correlates strongly (FDR < 0.01) with plasma concentrations of at least one PCB congener. Stronger effects were observed in males and in Sweden. This epigenetic exposure profile shows extensive and highly statistically significant overlaps with published profiles associated with the risk of future B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as well as with clinical CLL (38 and 28 CpG sites, respectively). For all these sites, the methylation changes were in the same direction for increasing exposure and for higher disease risk or clinical disease status, suggesting an etiological link between exposure and CLL. Mediation analysis reinforced the suggestion of a causal link between exposure, changes in DNA methylation and disease. Disease connectivity analysis identified multiple additional diseases associated with differentially methylated genes, including melanoma for which an etiological link with PCB exposure is established, as well as developmental and neurological diseases for which there is corresponding epidemiological evidence. Differentially methylated genes include many homeobox genes, suggesting that PCBs target stem cells. Furthermore, numerous polycomb protein target genes were hypermethylated with increasing exposure, an effect known to constitute an early marker of carcinogenesis. Conclusions: This study provides mechanistic evidence in support of a link between exposure to PCBs and the etiology of CLL and underlines the utility of omic profiling in the evaluation of the potential toxicity of environmental chemicals. © 2019 The Authors","B-cell lymphoma; DNA methylation; Environmental toxicology; Hazard assessment; Molecular epidemiology; Persistent organic pollutants",Article,Scopus

Here we show that SLC40A1, the gene encoding the iron exporter ferroportin (FPN), is variably expressed among primary AMLs and that low levels are associated with good prognosis and improved outcomes. In particular, core binding factor (CBF) AMLs, which are associated with good outcomes with chemotherapy, consistently have low level of SLC40A1 expression. AML cell lines that expressed relatively low levels of FPN endogenously, or were engineered via gene knockdown, had an increased sensitivity to chemotherapy relative to controls expressing high levels of FPN. Primary FPN low AML bulk cells also had increased sensitivity to Ara-C treatment, iron treatment and the combination of Ara-C and iron relative to FPN high cells.

In this study, the role of LINC00702 was identified and explored in malignant meningioma. The LINC00702 expression was determined in malignant meningioma tissues and cell lines by qRT-PCR. Then the association between LINC00702 expression and the prognosis of malignant meningioma patients was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The functional role of LINC00702 in malignant meningioma cell proliferation and migration was analyzed by loss-of function assays.

Conversely, glycolysis triggers accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), a potential causative factor in aging, by promoting methylglyoxal production. Therefore, it is reasonable that pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) would specifically regulate glycolysis to maintain their embryonic features. In this study, we focused on glycine decarboxylase (GLDC), a key enzyme in the glycine cleavage system that regulates glycolysis and methylglyoxal production in cancer. GLDC was exclusively expressed in PSCs, and inhibition of this enzyme induced alterations of metabolome and AGE accumulation, thereby suppressing the embryonic pluripotent state. Surprisingly, the level of accumulated AGEs in somatic cells gradually decreased during reprogramming, ultimately disappearing in iPSCs. In addition, ectopic expression of GLDC or treatment with the AGE inhibitor LR-90 promoted reprogramming. Together, these findings suggest that GLDC-mediated regulation of glycolysis and controlling AGE accumulation is related to maintenance and induction of pluripotency. © 2019","Advanced glycation end product (AGE); Glycine decarboxylase (GLDC); Glycolysis; Methylglyoxal; Pluripotent stem cell; Reprogramming",Article,Scopus

In addition to affecting differentiation during development and in the adult, BTG proteins play an important role in maintaining homeostasis under conditions of cellular stress. Genomic profiling of B-cell leukemia and lymphoma has put BTG1 and BTG2 in the spotlight, since both genes are frequently deleted or mutated in these malignancies, pointing towards a role as tumor suppressors. Moreover, in solid tumors, reduced expression of BTG1 or BTG2 is often correlated with malignant cell behavior and poor treatment outcome. Recent studies have uncovered novel roles for BTG1 and BTG2 in genotoxic and integrated stress responses, as well as during hematopoiesis. This review summarizes what is currently known about the roles of BTG1 and BTG2 in these and other cellular processes. In addition, we will highlight the molecular mechanisms and biological consequences of BTG1 and BTG2 deregulation during cancer progression and elaborate on the potential clinical implications of these findings. © 2018 The Authors.

Verification bias occurs when not all subjects have their labels observed. This is a common problem in disease diagnosis since the gold standard test to get labels, i.e., the true disease status, can be invasive and expensive. The same situation happens in the evaluation of semi-supervised learning, where the unlabeled data are incorporated. A Bayesian approach for estimating the ROC surface is proposed based on continuous data under a semi-parametric trinormality assumption. The proposed method is then extended to situations in the presence of verification bias. The posterior distribution is computed under the trinormality assumption using a rank-based likelihood. The consistency of the posterior under a mild condition is also established. The proposed method is compared with existing methods for estimating an ROC surface. Simulation results show that it performs well in terms of accuracy.

Hesperidin was gamma-irradiated at doses of 0, 30, 70, and 150 kGy. Gamma irradiation induced a decreased hesperidin peak, and a new radiolytic peak that gradually increased up to 150 kGy. The new radiolytic peak was fractionated, and the fractionated hesperidin derivative was used for subsequent experiments. Hesperidin gamma-irradiated at 150 kGy was toxic toward B16BL6 cells, but not toward bone marrow-derived macrophages. This cytotoxicity was exerted via induction of apoptosis, as reflected by the high population of double-positive cells, increased sub-G1 phase cells, depolarization of matrix metalloproteinase, production of reactive oxygen species, weakness of cell adhesion, changes in cell morphology, and inhibition of B16BL6 cell migration. Furthermore, 150 kGy gamma-irradiated hesperidin decreased the expression of Bcl-2 and pro-caspases-3 and -9, increased the expression of Bax and cytosolic cytochrome c, and increased the cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase. In vitro mechanistic study revealed that 150 kGy gamma-irradiated hesperidin achieved significantly greater inhibition of lung metastasis and growth of melanoma B16BL6 cells in C57BL/6 mice than non-irradiated intact hesperidin did.

Unexpectedly, we found that CPT upregulates hTERT expression and concomitantly increases telomerase activity. However, transfection of hTERT-targeting siRNA had no effect on CPT-induced G 2 /M phase arrest, suggesting that CPT-induced telomerase activation was not related to G 2 /M phase arrest. CPT simultaneously increased Nrf2 expression and the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), whereas pretreatment with the antioxidants N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) or glutathione (GSH) strongly attenuated ROS production, which was accompanied by hTERT downregulation. Additionally, transient Nrf2 knockdown enhanced CPT-induced ROS production and hTERT promoter activity. CPT also upregulated hTERT expression and telomerase activity by inducing c-Myc and Sp1 expression and activity. Moreover, c-Myc stimulated ROS production in response to CPT, leading to Sp1 activation, which promoted hTERT expression and telomerase activity. CPT treatment enhanced the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt, which led to hTERT phosphorylation into the nucleus. These findings demonstrate that CPT positively regulates telomerase activity by upregulating hTERT expression and phosphorylation via the c-Myc/ROS/Sp1 and PI3K/Akt axis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","c-Myc; Camptothecin; hTERT; ROS; Sp1; Telomerase",Article,Scopus

Even though drugs are currently available for the treatment of osteoporosis, there remains an unmet need for the development of more specific novel agents with less adverse effects. Dehydrocostus lactone (DHC), a natural sesquiterpene lactone, was previously found to affect the differentiation of inflammatory cells by inhibiting NF-κB pathways, and garnered much interest for its anti-cancer properties via SOCS-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. As NF-κB pathway plays an essential role in osteoclast differentiation, we sought to discover the biological effects of DHC on osteoclast differentiation and resorptive activity, as well as the underlying mechanisms on these effects. Our research found that DHC inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, bone resorption and osteoclast specific genes expression via suppression of NF-κB and NFAT signaling pathways in vitro. We further demonstrated that DHC protected against ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss in mice and the protective effect was mediated at least in part through the attenuation of NF-κB signaling pathway.

Results: The mean and predictive mean give similar estimates, but the latter displays greater uncertainty. Namely, PET/CT outperforms CW on average but may not do better than CW when implemented in future settings.

However, resulting from their low abundance, short length and high sequence similarity among family members, it is of major challenge to detect these miRNAs. On the basis of a mismatched catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) amplification and ratiometric strategy, we constructed an electrochemical sensor for sensitively detecting miRNAs from tumor cells. The target miRNA can cyclically trigger the assembly of two hairpins with mismatched bases into many duplexes via CHA. Subsequently, these duplexes further associate with another hairpin assembled on the sensor surface to generate stable “Y”-shaped DNA complexes, which causes reverse current change for two electrochemical labels on the hairpins. It is found that the introduction of the mismatched bases in the hairpins for CHA can reduce the background noise to improve the signal to background ratio of the sensor, leading to a dynamic range of 5 fM–0.1 nM and a low detection limit of 1.1 fM for miRNA detection. Besides, the developed sensor can be employed to monitor and evaluate the expression levels of miRNAs in different tumor cells, demonstrating its potential real applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Catalytic hairpin assembly; MicroRNA; Ratiometric electrochemical sensor; Tumor cells",Article,Scopus

Fluorescence enhancement of the nanosensor for Fe(III), which achieved high sensitivity detection of Fe(III) and the detection limit was 18.7 pM. The nanosensor was able to differentiate normal cells (hepatocytes LX-2) with cancer cells (HepG2) by fluorescence imaging of Fe(III) levels in cells. Finally, the nanosensor was successfully applied for fluorescence imaging of Fe(III) levels in labile iron pools of ferroptosis. This study not only provides a sensitive imaging method for Fe(III) in cells, but also provides a new strategy for study of Fe(III)-related cellular function regulation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Ferric iron; Fluorescence imaging; Gold nanoparticles; Labile iron pools; Nanosensor",Article,Scopus

Then, Hep3B cells and SNU449 cells were infected with LV-shLINC00707 and LV-LINC00707. LINC00707 silencing could greatly repress the proliferation and colony formation of HCC cells in vitro. On the contrary, overexpression of LINC00707 induced HCC cell proliferation and colony formation. In addition, HCC cell apoptosis was significantly enhanced and HCC cell cycle was blocked in G1 phase by LV-shLINC00707. Hep3B cells and SNU449 cell invasion capacity was restrained by the knockdown of LINC00707, whereas upregulation of LINC00707 exhibited an opposite phenomenon.

First, we confirmed the effects of EDCs on ER activity using OECD Test Guideline 455.

BPA, BBP, and DEHP enhanced ERα-mediated transcriptional activity under hypoxia. All three EDCs decreased ERα protein levels under hypoxia in MCF-7 cells. The transcriptional activity of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 was decreased and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was increased by BPA and BBP under hypoxia in MCF-7 cells, but not by DEHP.

Compared to NK cells from healthy controls, NK cells from HCC patients presented functional impairment, characterized by significantly reduced cytotoxicity, degranulation, and cytokine production. Exogenous IL-21 could reinvigorate NK cells from HCC patients, resulting in significantly increased levels of cytotoxicity, degranulation, and cytokine expression.

This approach has yielded excellent results in many research fields due to its versatility, with infinite possible combinations of transition metals and organic systems. This review focuses on the most innovative results of the authors’ research in the field of organometallic conjugates of peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) and 7-thiahelicenes. In both cases, the presence of the metal gives the organic molecule with specific chemico-physical properties, which can be useful for applications in catalysis, imaging, electrochemical and, spectroscopic analysis. In particular, the conjugation of PNA, with transition metal complexes involving chromium and iron makes it possible to achieve significant IR and electrochemical detection at a very low concentration without affecting the specificity and efficiency of PNA/DNA binding. Dinuclear Re-PNA conjugates were rapidly internalised in DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells. This confirmed the fundamental role of the metal in increasing the cell uptake of PNA, and favoured the down-regulation of the expression of the miR-21. The complexation of 7-thiahelicenes with different metals was first performed to obtain systems with improved nonlinear optical properties.

We verified that mimics of miR-217 were able to suppress the osteosarcoma development. Furthermore, real-time quantitative PCR showed that HOTAIR siRNA increased miR-217 expression. Besides these, ZEB1 was identified as a downstream gene of miR-217 and we found that HOTAIR can mediate osteosarcoma progress by upregulating ZEB1 expression via acting as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) via miR-217. Taken these together, our findings in this study indicated that HOTAIR/miR-217/ZEB1 axis, as a novel research point can provide new insights into molecular mechanism of osteosarcoma development. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","HOTAIR; miR-217; osteosarcoma; ZEB1",Article,Scopus

Recently, IL-21 has been contemplated for use in the treatment of cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating human IL-21 gene expression has not yet been described. In this study, we initially studied the promoter region and identified the transcription start site. We thereafter described the essential region upstream of the transcription start site and showed the in vivo binding of NFATc2 and SP1 transcription factors to this region, in addition to their positive role in IL-21 expression. We also studied the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating IL-21 expression. We, thus, established the miRNA profile of CD4+CD45RO+ versus CD4+CD45RA+ isolated from healthy volunteers and identified a signature composed of 12 differentially expressed miRNAs. We showed that miR-302c is able to negatively regulate IL-21 expression by binding directly to its target site in the 3′-untranslated region. Moreover, after using fresh human CD4-positive T cells, we observed the high acetylation level of histone H4, an observation well in line with the already described high expression of IL-21 in CD4+CD45RO+ versus CD4+CD45RA+ T cells.

The therapeutic outcome of DAUN-based therapy is compromised by its cardiotoxicity and emergence of drug resistance. This phenomenon is often caused by pharmacokinetic mechanisms such as efflux of DAUN from cancer cells through ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and its conversion to less cytostatic but more cardiotoxic daunorubicinol (DAUN-OL) by carbonyl reducing enzymes (CREs). Here we aimed to investigate, whether two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, AZD5438 and R547, can interact with these pharmacokinetic mechanisms and reverse DAUN resistance. Using accumulation assays, we revealed AZD5438 as potent inhibitor of ABCC1 showing also weaker inhibitory effect to ABCB1 and ABCG2. Combination index analysis, however, shown that inhibition of ABCC1 does not significantly contribute to synergism between AZD5438 and DAUN in MDCKII-ABCC1 cells, suggesting predominant role of other mechanism. Using pure recombinant enzymes, we found both tested drugs to inhibit CREs with aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3). This interaction was further confirmed in transfected HCT-116 cells. Moreover, these cells were sensitized to DAUN by both compounds as Chou-Talalay combination index analysis showed synergism in AKR1C3 transfected HCT-116, but not in empty vector transfected control cell line. In conclusion, we propose AZD5438 and R547 as modulators of DAUN resistance that can prevent AKR1C3-mediated DAUN biotransformation to DAUN-OL. This interaction could be beneficially exploited to prevent failure of DAUN-based therapy as well as the undesirable cardiotoxic effect of DAUN-OL. © 2019","ABC transporters; Carbonyl reducing enzymes; Daunorubicin; Drug resistance",Article,Scopus

Because of their esthetically pleasing symmetry as well as unusual chemical properties, carboranes have attracted immense interest. Studies over the past 40 years have revealed them to have chemical features that make them useful in a number of specialized applications such as conducting organic polymers, nuclear waste remediation, and as liquid crystalline materials. It has also been shown that carboranes can be used as boron delivery agents for boron neutron capture therapy against cancer. While a number of strides have been made in synthesizing these molecules, their characterization by NMR spectroscopy is challenging due to boron–boron and boron–hydrogen coupling. This gives rise to broad and unresolved peaks and makes peak assignment difficult and often based on best guesses. NMR structural characterization studies of carborane compounds are sparse, dated, and often performed at low resolution. This report provides a detailed structural characterization of an m-carborane derivative, featuring high-resolution multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy (2-D 1 H– 1 H, 2-D 11 B– 11 B, 2-D 11 B– 1 H, and 2-D 13 C– 1 H).

DDC has been considered as a potential novel biomarker for various types of cancer, however, the role of DDC in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be evaluated.

Its increased level beyond the normal concentration in human biological samples is related to different kinds of cancers development. In this contribution, a novel colorimetric assay is reported for SA detection in form of N-acetylneuraminic acid. The sensitive detection strategy is proposed via the specific SA induced aggregation of 3‑aminophenyl boronic acid (3APBA) assembled on dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs-DSP). DSP was functionalized on AuNPs through a strong Au–S interaction and 3APBA was assembled on AuNPs-DSP by the amine coupling reaction between the carboxyl group of DSP on gold nanoparticles surface and the amino group of 3APBA to generate a covalent amide bond. The addition of 3APBA to buffered AuNPs-DSP generated a ruby red colloidal nanosensor. With increasing concentration of SA, a probe color turned rapidly from red to blue-gray via aggregation of AuNPs-DSP-3APBA. At optimal conditions, the absorbance ratio (A 700 /A 520 ) was linear with SA concentrations ranging from 0.08 to 0.25 mM and 0.30–0.70 mM. A limit of detection of 35.0 μM was achieved which is the lowest amongst reported colorimetric methods for SA determination. The practical efficacy of the assay was demonstrated on human serum, along with no interfering effects and satisfactory accuracy and precision. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","3‑Aminophenyl boronic acid; Dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate); Gold nanoparticles; Human serum; Sialic acid",Article,Scopus

Pyruvate is known to undergo several fates depending upon the organism under consideration. It is one of the only molecules involved in both synthesis and breakdown pathways, thereby making it a very busy molecule. Aberrant levels of this metabolite are known to cause several disorders like diabetes, cirrhosis, cardiovascular diseases and severe brain abnormalities. This is an attractive candidate for bodybuilders as a supplement, and also holds an important position in the food and beverage industry. Recent research also showed pyruvate as a screening molecule for cancer. Thereby, detection of this metabolite is an important aspect from the clinical and diagnostic point of view. Conventional methods available for the detection of pyruvate had several disadvantages such as tedious, time-consuming, non-specific, expensive instrumental setup, the requirement of trained personnel's, especially for chromatographic techniques. Biosensing techniques overcome these pitfalls, as these are easy, highly sensitive and fast.

Objective: This article aims to examine health-related characteristics of two distinct samples of Portuguese centenarians (one predominantly rural – PR vs. one predominantly urban - PU), and explore potential dissimilarities in their morbidity profiles and use of health care services. Methods: A total of 241 centenarians were considered. Sociodemographic characteristics, health status, and use of health care services were assessed by semi-structured interviews with the centenarians and their proxies (family or formal caregiver). Results: A higher average of 4.80 self-reported illnesses (sd = 2.01) were found in the PU sample (vs. 2.96; sd = 1.77 in the PR sample); in overall the PR sample presented a better health condition with lower levels of physical and mental impairments, and a greater number of centenarians who did not succumb to the three most common lethal diseases (heart disease, non-skin cancer and stroke) in the elderly population (85.4% vs. 60% in the PU sample). Conclusions: Portuguese centenarians experienced a substantial number of illnesses, but an overall better health status was found in centenarians from the PR area.

A nanobody with an isoelectric point (pI) of 8.6, named EGFR dimer Nb77, was selected for further analysis of anticancer activities. EGFR dimer Nb77 was expressed in Escherichia coli Shuffle T7-B as a soluble (His) 6 -tagged protein and purified by a CM Sepharose column and a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column. Purified EGFR dimer Nb77 could specifically bind to the surface of EGFR-overexpressing A431 cells in a dose-dependent and ligand-dependent manner, and this nanobody could effectively inhibit the growth of the tumour cells, with an inhibition rate similar to that of the monoclonal antibody EGFR dimer 5G9, which also targets the dimer interface of EGFR. This work is the first to prove that nanobodies targeting the dimer interface of EGFR have promising prospects as anticancer agents. © 2019","Dimer interface; Dimerization; EGFR; Nanobody; Tumour",Article,Scopus

The in silico assessment (3D structures and functions) of these proteins were performed using Iterative Threading ASSEmbly Refinement (I-TASSER) analysis and RAMPAGE program. These two purified proteins were able to relieve the necrotic hepatocytes (by 60.4%) via reducing tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) and intracellular reactive species. The latter effects associated with improving hepatocyte functions. Furthermore, they revealed the potent anticancer effect via induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis and controlling the expression of both Bcl-2 and p53 in HepG2 cells.

Under the fluorescence quenching effect of Ti 3 C 2 NSs, ssDNA probe (P) shows the minimal fluorescent emission. After the formation of duplex structure with its complementary target, ssDNA (T), the fluorescence intensity enhances evidently. Exonuclease III (Exo III) was used to improve the sensitivity by promoting more fluorescence enhancement. This magnified fluorescent sensor for HPV-18 detection shows a low detection limit of 100 pM and a high specificity. Furthermore, the developed DNA sensor can be employed to determine PCR amplified HPV-18 from cervical scrapes samples.

Methods: Bone tumor tissues and the matched normal tissues were obtained from 36 OS patients who received tumor resection from 2014 to 2018. The expression of EPIC1 and MEF2D was determined by quantitative real-Time PCR and western blotting. Cell viability and invasion were evaluated by MTT assay and transwell assay. The animal xenograft model was also established. Results: EPIC1 was down-regulated, but MEF2D was up-regulated in OS tissues and OS cell lines. Overexpression of EPIC1 inhibited cell viability and invasion of OS cells. Targeting relationship between EPIC1 and MEF2D was confirmed by RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP). The MEF2D protein binding to ubiquitin was significantly increased in OS cells overexpressing EPIC1. The co-transfection with pcDNA-EPIC1 and pcDNA-MEF2D rescued the inhibition of cell viability and invasion caused by the overexpression of EPIC1.

NGF exerts its effects primarily through tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), inducing a cascade of tyrosine kinase-initiated responses. In spite of its importance, the general behavior of NGF looks contradictory: its effects can be both stimulatory and inhibitory. The present study aims to explore the molecular mechanisms induced by NGF in glioma cancer cells. Methods: The effects of NGF were investigated in high grade glioma and low grade pediatric glioma (PLGG) cell lines through comparative studies. In particular, we investigated TrkA-mediated cellular pathways, molecular signaling, proliferation, cell cycle and cellular senescence. Results: We found that exposure of PLGG cells to NGF produced stable growth arrest with the features of a senescence phenotype but without the expression of anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, a marker of apoptosis. Moreover, NGF treatment promoted the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling. In addition, K252a, a TrkA inhibitor, significantly reduced the phosphorylation of the aforementioned signaling pathways, suggesting that NGF-activated ERK1/2 and AKT signaling take place downstream of TrkA-neurotrophin interaction. Conclusions: These findings provide the first evidence that NGF can induce senescence of PLGG cells in a receptor-mediated fashion, thus supporting the hypothesis that in the clinical setting NGF might be beneficial to pediatric glioma patients. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cellular senescence; glioma cell lines; nerve growth factor (NGF); neurotrophin",Article,Scopus

The dipole moments of CP and RGD were close to 8 Debye and this value was increased to 11.403, 7.5398, 14.946 and 10.321 in structures 1, 6, 7 and 8, respectively, demonstrating water (1.85 Debye) with high polarity and non-toxicity, is an appropriate solvent for delivery of such polar CP-RGD systems. The HOMO orbital in all CP-RGD systems was positioned on the cyclophosphamide but the LUMO orbital was dispersed on the tripeptide. Between CP-RGD-7 and CP-RGD-8 having the least binding energy values, CP-RGD-8 exhibited smaller values of chemical potential, energy gap and hardness but the greatest electronegativity and electrophilicity index that certified this structure had greater affinity for binding onto the cancerous tissue. Accordingly, it was established that among all CP-RGD systems, the CP-RGD-8 was the most promising system for the cancer treatment. Considering the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations results obtained at two temperatures (25 and 37 °C), the CP-3RGD was chosen as the most suitable system due to it exhibited desirable drug loading capacity and slow release rate. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Anticancer drug; Cyclophosphamide; DFT computations; Drug delivery; Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations; Tripeptide RGD",Article,Scopus

Experimental design: Our study consisted of 331 patients underwent bp-MRI before pathological examination from January 2013 to November 2016. Radiomics features were extracted from peripheral zone (PZ), transition zone (TZ), and lesion areas segmented on images obtained by T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and its derivative apparent-diffusion coefficient (ADC) imaging. The individual prediction model, built using the clinical data and biparametric MRI features (Bp signature), was prepared using data of 232 patients and validated using data of 99 patients. The predictive performance was calculated and demonstrated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curves. Results: The Bp signature, based on the six selected radiomics features of bp-MRI, showed better discrimination in the validation cohort (area under the curve [AUC], 0.92) than on each subcategory images (AUC, 0.81 on T2WI; AUC, 0.77 on DWI; AUC, 0.89 on ADC). The differential diagnostic efficiency was poorer with the clinical model (AUC, 0.73), built using the selected independent clinical risk factors with statistical significance (P < 0.05), than with the Bp signature. Discrimination efficiency improved when including the Bp signature and clinical factors [i.e., the individual prediction model (AUC, 0.93)]. Conclusion: The Bp signature, based on bp-MRI, performed better than each single imaging modality. The individual prediction model including the radiomics signatures and clinical factors showed better preoperative diagnostic performance, which could contribute to clinical individualized treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biparametric magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Prostate cancer; Radiomics",Article,Scopus

DDM-Madrid is a cross-sectional study that recruited 1403 premenopausal women in a breast radiodiagnosis unit of Madrid City Council. Information was collected with a questionnaire and plasma 25(OH)D was measured by solid-phase extraction on-line coupled to liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Percent mammographic density was assessed using a semi-automated computer tool (DM-Scan). Multivariable linear regression models were used to quantify the associations, categorizing 25(OH)D levels (nmol/L) into 3 groups according to the cut-offs established by the US Endocrine Society. Models were adjusted for age, education, body mass index, age at menarche, parity, previous breast biopsies, family history of breast cancer, physical activity, energy intake, use of corticoids, hypercholesterolemia and day of sample extraction. Mean serum 25(OH)D level was 49.4 + 18.9 nmol/L. Women with sufficient concentrations of 25(OH)D showed a slight decrease in mammographic density (β &gt;75nmol/L =-3.40; p = 0.037). No differences were observed according to women characteristics except for parity, where the protective effect of 25(OH)D was only seen among nulliparous (β &gt;75nmol/L =-13.00; p-heterogeneity = 0.006). In light of the protective effect of vitamin D on mammographic density and the high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in our population, improving these levels could be an effective measure for the prevention of health problems related to the lack of this essential vitamin. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","25(OH)D; Breast density; Calcidiol; Parity; Vitamin D",Article,Scopus

Results showed that DLEU2 is a high potential OS related marker among 73 functional lncRNAs. DLEU2 and its intronic miR-15a and miR-16-1 expression were significantly upregulated in EAD compared with adjacent normal tissues. However, miR-15a and miR-16-1 expression were only weakly correlated with DLEU2 expression. Univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed that DLEU2 expression, but not miR-15a or miR-16-1 expression is an independent prognostic marker in terms of OS (HR:1.688, 95%CI: 1.085–2.627, p = 0.020) in EAD patients. The exon 9 of DLEU2 is very strongly co-expressed with DLEU2 (Pearson's r = 0.96) and showed better predictive value than total DLEU2 expression in predicting the OS of EAD patients. Multivariate analysis confirmed its independent prognostic value (HR:1.970, 95%CI: 1.266–3.067, p = 0.003), after adjustment of histologic grade, pathological stages and the presence of residual tumor. By checking the methylation status of DLEU2 gene, we excluded the possibility of the influence of two CpG sites near the DLEU2 exon 9 locus on its expression. In addition, although copy number alterations (CNAs) were observed DLEU2 gene, heterozygous loss (-1), low-level copy gain (+1) and high-level amplification (+2) had no significant association with DLEU2 transcription.

Caco-2 spontaneously differentiate into a monolayer expressing several specific characteristics, typically showed by mature enterocytes. For in vitro experiments, it is crucial to identify non-invasive and non-destructive techniques able to evaluate the integrity and differentiation of the cells monolayer. Thus, we aimed to assess these properties by analyzing electrical impedance measurements. Methods: Caco-2 cells were differentiated for 21 days. The monolayer integrity and differentiation were primarily evaluated by means of morphological, biochemical and molecular data. Impedance measurements in a range of frequencies from 400 Hz to 50 kHz were performed using a dedicated set up, including customized Aerosol Jet Printed carbon-based sensors. Results: The trends of RI observed at three different frequencies were able to describe cell growth and differentiation. In order to evaluate which frequencies better correlate with cell differentiation, Principal Component Analysis have been employed and the concordance analysis between RI magnitude and morphological, biochemical and molecular data, highlighted 40 kHz as the optimal frequency to assess Caco-2 cells differentiation process. Conclusion: We demonstrated the feasibility and reliability of applying impedance-based measurements not only to provide information about the monolayer status, but also for cell differentiation monitoring. General significance: This study underlined the possibility to use a dedicated sensor to assess the integrity and differentiation of Caco-2 monolayer, as a reliable non-destructive alternative to conventional approaches. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Barrier integrity; Caco-2 cells; Cell differentiation; Enterocyte-like cells; Impedance-based sensors",Article,Scopus

Present study investigates the potential of oleic acid-functionalized iron-oxide nanoparticles (MN-OA) to enhance the radiation response of fibrosarcoma tumor and elucidates its underlying mechanism. Methods: Various cellular and molecular assays (e.g. MTT, clonogenic, cell cycle analysis, cell death, DNA damage/repair) and tumor growth kinetics were employed to investigate the mechanism of MN-OA induced radio-sensitization. Results: Mouse (WEHI-164) and human (HT-1080) fibrosarcoma cells treated with MN-OA and gamma-radiation (2 Gy) showed a significant decrease in the cell proliferation. Combination treatment showed significant decrease in clonogenic survival of WEHI-164 cells and was found to induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe. The mechanism of radio-sensitization was found to involve binding of MN-OA with HSP90, resulting in down-regulation of its client proteins, involved in cell cycle progression (Cyclin B1 and CDC2) and DNA-double strand break repair (e.g. RAD51 and BRCA1).

Results: Pain (n = 18) and fatigue and sleep disturbance (n = 18) were the most frequently evaluated symptom clinical content categories. Studies accessed ePAT from sources such as Twitter and online community forums or patient portals focused on diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and depression. Fifteen studies used NLP as a primary methodology. Studies reported evaluation metrics including the precision, recall, and F-measure for symptom-specific research questions. Discussion: NLP and text mining have been used to extract and analyze patient-authored symptom data in a wide variety of online communities. Though there are computational challenges with accessing ePAT, the depth of information provided directly from patients offers new horizons for precision medicine, characterization of sub-clinical symptoms, and the creation of personal health libraries as outlined by the National Library of Medicine. Conclusion: Future research should consider the needs of patients expressed through ePAT and its relevance to symptom science.

Circulating miRNAs have increasingly been recognized as biomarkers for detecting and diagnosing those diseases. Few studies have investigated the association of circulating miRNA with the early stages of cognitive impairment, such as mild cognitive impairment, in the general population. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between cognitive function and several serum miRNAs levels related to amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteolysis in a Japanese general population who had never been diagnosed with dementia. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 337 Japanese subjects (144 men, 193 women) who attended a health examination. The short form of the Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE) was used to assess cognitive function. Serum levels of 6 miRNAs (let-7d, miR-17, miR-20a, miR-27a, miR-34a, miR-103a) were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: Multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for lower SMMSE score (SMMSE score < 28) were significantly increased in the lowest tertile of serum miR-20a (OR, 2.08; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09–4.04) and miR-103a (OR, 1.91; 95%CI, 1.00–3.69) compared to the highest tertile. Moreover, serum levels of miR-20a, -27a, and -103a were linearly and positively associated with SMMSE scores after adjustment for confounding factors. Conclusion: Low serum levels of miR-20a, -27a, and -103a are independently associated with cognitive impairment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Circulating microRNA; Cognitive function; Cross-sectional study; General population; Mini-Mental State Examination",Article,Scopus

Incomplete remodeling of the valve can trigger degenerative processes that lead to a myxomatous phenotype that includes loss of PN. However, signaling pathways involved that link valvular-interstitial-fibroblast cells (VICs) to proliferation, migration and actin remodeling functions are unclear. The p21-activated kinases (Paks) have been shown to regulate cytoskeleton rearrangements and cell proliferation/adhesion/migration functions in a variety of cellular contexts, including normal cells and cancer cells. This study shows that Pak1, but not Pak2 and Pak4, is a critical mediator of VIC survival and actin organization, and that the molecular signaling regulating actin-remodeling is initiated upon PN/beta-integrin-induced phosphorylation of the focal-adhesion-kinase (Fak) (Y397). Molecular and pharmacological inhibition of key components of PN/Fak/Akt1 signaling abolished the PN-induced actin polymerization and the activation of mTOR, p70S6K and Pak1. Similarly, blocking mTOR inhibited p70S6K, Pak1 phosphorylation and consequently actin-polymerization. Accordingly, inhibiting p70S6K blocked Pak1 phosphorylation and actin polymerization, and subsequently inhibited adhesion and growth of VICs. Periostin-induced Akt1 activation of Pak1 is independent of Cdc42 and Rac1 GTPases, and Akt1 is both downstream and upstream of Pak1. Further, the PN-Pak1-induced Akt1 protects cells from apoptosis through suppression of transcriptional activation of Forkhead-Transcription-Factor (FKHR).

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are of particular concern as they have been associated with well-established risk factors of HF, but current data are limited. Objectives: We aimed to assess the association between dietary PCB exposure and risk of HF, accounting for dietary intake of long-chain omega-3 fish fatty acids. Design: We used the prospective population-based research structure SIMPLER (previously the Swedish Mammography Cohort and Cohort of Swedish Men) comprising 32,952 women and 36,546 men, free from cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes at baseline in 1997. Validated estimates of dietary PCBs and long-chain omega-3 fish fatty acids [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] were obtained via a food frequency questionnaire at baseline. Incident cases of HF were ascertained through register linkage. Results: During an average of 12 years of follow-up, we ascertained 2736 and 3128 incident cases of HF in women and men, respectively. In multivariable-adjusted models, mutually adjusted for PCBs and EPA-DHA, the relative risk (RR) for dietary PCB exposure was 1.48 (95% CI 1.12–1.96) in women and 1.42 (95% CI 1.08–1.86) in men, comparing extreme quintiles. Corresponding RRs for EPA-DHA intake were 0.71 (95% CI 0.54–0.93) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.63–1.07), respectively. Conclusions: Dietary exposure to PCBs was associated with an increased risk of HF in both women and men. EPA-DHA intake was associated with a lower risk of HF in women, with a similar tendency in men. © 2019 The Authors","Fish; Heart failure; Long-chain omega-3 fish fatty acids; Polychlorinated biphenyls",Article,Scopus

In this study, QSAR models for ERRα agonism and luciferase inhibition were developed for the in silico determination of potential ERRα agonists among common endogenous and exogenous substances from the Human Metabolome Database and EU Pesticides Database. The role of the luciferase inhibition model is to detect potential False Positives among predicted ERRα agonists due to interference with the assays reporter. An Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm was used to find optimal models parameters that are optimal for developing models with the best Balance Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity and Positive Predictive Value. Optimized models were merged to create combined ones in order to overcome the shortcomings of individual models. Combined models were used for prediction and a final prediction call scheme was designed to combine the ERRα agonism and luminescence inhibition predictions into a clear activity evaluation. 16 chemicals are recommended for ERRα agonism testing, most notable being isoflavones glycitein and naringenin, as well as, several metabolites of daidzein and genistein. The importance of the counterscreen assay and literature data in support of testing is discussed.

Magnetite nanoparticles were incorporated by two methods - co-precipitation with porous calcium carbonate during template formation and adsorption onto CaCO 3 particles or microcontainers’ shell. Amount of magnetite loaded and microshells size (4.6 to 6.9 μm) were found to depend on the chosen method for magnetite nanoparticles incorporation. Stability of hollow microshells in saline, phosphate buffer and culturing media was studied. Microcontainers’ susceptibility to magnetic field was investigated in solutions of varied viscosity, and their group movement velocity under constant magnetic field was evaluated by sequential optical microscopy imaging. Cell viability tests with prepared microshells were performed that demonstrated negligible cytotoxicity effect on human dermal fibroblasts cells. With HeLa cells moderate viability inhibition was found at high carriers:cells ratio at early time points which is attributed to more active and receptor-mediated endocytosis of carriers as well as known cytotoxicity of magnetite in some cancer cells. At 24 and 48 h time points HeLa cells proliferation fully recovers.

The multifunctional nanoconjugates were characterized and evaluated using extensive in vitro and in vivo techniques. The nanoconjugates demonstrated excellent heating ability on exposure to alternating magnetic field and near-infrared laser irradiation. The acidic microenvironment of lysozome triggered release of LND from SPANs. Owing to leaching of Fe and Pt contents, SPANs demonstrated ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in U87MG cell line which further enhanced therapeutic effect of SPANs. Significant difference in cell viability suppression was observed in in vitro photothermal, chemo-photothermal and chemo-magnetophotothermal killing of cancer cells using SPANs in U87MG cell lines. Significant difference in heating ability and cell cytotoxicity of SPANs in comparison to alternative magnetic field and NIR irradiation was observed for DUAL-mode exposure of SPANs.

Quantitative proteome analysis of liver tissues was performed by 2-nitrobenzenesulfenyl tagging, two-dimensional-nano high-performance liquid chromatography separation, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry analysis. Diffrenetial proteins were verified by the immunochemistry method. 36 and 44 differentially expressed proteins were identified, respectively, at 24 hr after APAP (200 or 300 mg·kg −1 ) administration. The decrease in the mitochondrial protective proteins Prdx6, Prdx3, and Aldh2 accounted for the accumulation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and aldehydes, impairing mitochondria structure and function. The Gzmf combined with Bax and Apaf-1 jointly contributed to the necrosis. The blockage of Stat3 activation led to the overexpression of unphosphorylated Stat3 and the overproduction of Bax. The overexpression of unphosphorylated Stat3 represented necrosis; the alternation from Stat3 to p-Stat3 in necrotic regions represented hepatocytes from death to renewal.

Methods: Microarray analysis was based on 25 pairs of HCC cancerous tissues and adjacent tissues. The expression levels of CRNDE, miR-203, and BCAT1 in HCC tissues were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The liver cell line L-02 and HCC cell lines HepG2 and Huh-7 were utilized to assess the regulatory eﬀects of CRNDE and miR-203 on HCC progression in vitro.

Cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated using CCK-8 and flow cytometry analysis, whereas cell invasion and migration assay were performed by the Transwell assay. The relationship among CRNDE, miR-203, and BCAT1 was validated by dual luciferase assay. Tumor Xenograft study was established to verify the pathological effect of CRNDE on HCC development in vivo. Results: The expression levels of the CRNDE and BCAT1 were upregulated in HCC tissues and cells, whereas miR-203 was downregulated in HCC. Knockdown of CRNDE or miR-203 overexpression would inhibit HCC cell propagation and metastasis, and induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, miR-203 was negatively correlated with CRNDE, the same as miR-203 with BCAT1.

Several pH-based MRI imaging approaches have been proposed but for these to be useful, disentangling the effects of pH from other parameters which may affect the measured MRI signal is crucial to ensure accuracy and specificity. R 1 relaxation in the rotating frame (R 1 ρ ) is an example of a method that has been proposed to probe pH in vivo using MRI. In this study, we have investigated the relationship between R 1 ρ , pH, and macromolecular density in vitro using phantoms and in human volunteers. Here we show that the rate of R 1 ρ relaxation (=1/T 1 ρ ) varies with pH but only in the presence of macromolecules. At constant pH, phantom macromolecular density inversely correlated with R 1 ρ . R 1 ρ imaging of the normal human brain demonstrated regional heterogeneity with significant differences between structurally distinct regions, which are likely to be independent of pH. For example, R 1 ρ was higher in the basal ganglia compared to grey matter and higher in grey matter compared to white matter.

In HCC patients, the frequency of Vδ2 T cells was significantly lower than in controls. γδ T cells that were harvested directly ex vivo possessed very limited capacity to eliminate Zol-loaded HCC cell lines, even at a high effector to target ratio. In vitro expansion with Zol could significantly increase the capacity of γδ T cells to eliminate HCC cell lines. But even with in vitro expansion, the γδ T cells from HCC patients presented significantly lower cytotoxic capacity than the γδ T cells from healthy individuals. The expression of IL-2 and IL-21 by γδ T cells was significantly lower in HCC patients than in control volunteers. Supplementing recombinant human IL-2 and IL-21 in the in vitro expansion culture increased the cytotoxic capacity of γδ T cells. In addition, the frequency of PD-1 + γδ T cells was significantly higher in HCC patients than in controls ex vivo, and was significantly elevated after in vitro expansion.

Recently, we have shown that crocin binds to purified tubulin at the vinblastine site, depolymerizes microtubules and induces a mitotic block in cultured cells. Here, we extend our previous suggestion and explore the cellular effects of crocin to further understand its mechanism of action. In a kinetic study, we observed that the crocin-induced depolymerization of microtubules preceded both DNA damage and reactive oxygen species generation indicating that depolymerizing microtubules is the primary action of crocin. Crocin also inhibited the growth of cold-depolymerized microtubules in HeLa cells indicating that it can inhibit microtubule dynamics. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, crocin was found to suppress the spindle microtubule dynamics in live HeLa cells. Further, crocin treatment resulted in activation of spindle assembly checkpoint proteins, BubR1 and Mad2. Similar to other microtubule-targeting agents, crocin also perturbed the localization of end-binding protein EB1 from the growing microtubule ends and enhanced the acetylation of remaining microtubules. Further, crocin was found to bind to purified tubulin with a dissociation constant of 12 ± 1.5 μM. The results suggested that crocin exerted its antiproliferative effect primarily by inhibiting the assembly and dynamics of microtubules. Importantly, the combination of crocin with known anticancer agents like combretastatin A-4, cisplatin, doxorubicin or sorafenib, exerted a strong synergistic cytotoxic effect in HeLa cells indicating that crocin may enhance the effectiveness of other anticancer agents. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Combination therapy; Crocin; Microtubule dynamics; Microtubule-targeting agent; Tubulin",Article,Scopus

Ototoxicity leads to dose reduction during the cisplatin chemotherapy and results in inadequate treatment of malignant tumors. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of ferulic acid on cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. Methods: House Ear Institute-Organ of Corti 1 (HEI-OC1) cells were exposed to 30 μM of cisplatin for 24 h with or without pretreatment with ferulic acid. Cell viability was determined using the WST assay. Apoptotic cells were identified using TUNEL assay. Western blot analysis was performed to examine the change in expression of cleaved caspase, cleaved poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and catalase. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by flow cytometry. Real-time PCR analyses were performed to examine the mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes including glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (Gclc), glutathione peroxidase 2 (Gpx2), catalase, and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). Phalloidin staining of the organ of Corti was performed to determine hair cell survival or degeneration. Results: Pretreatment with ferulic acid before cisplatin exposure significantly increased cell viability, levels of antioxidant enzymes, and hair cell survival. In addition, pretreatment with ferulic acid significantly reduced apoptotic cells, levels of cleaved caspase, levels of cleaved PARP, and intracellular ROS production. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that ferulic acid inhibited cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity by preventing ROS formation and inducing the production of endogenous antioxidants and indicated that ferulic acid might be used as a protective agent against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Apoptosis; Cell death; Cisplatin; Ferulic acid; Ototoxicity",Article,Scopus

Reversion Inducing Cysteine Rich Protein with Kazal Motifs (RECK) is a cell surface expressed, membrane anchored protein, and its overexpression inhibits cancer cell migration. We hypothesized that minocycline inhibits platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced human aortic smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration via RECK upregulation. Our data show that the BB homodimer of recombinant PDGF (PDGF-BB) induced SMC migration and proliferation, effects significantly blunted by pre-treatment with minocycline. Further investigations revealed that PDGF-BB induced PI3K-dependent AKT activation, ERK activation, reactive oxygen species generation, Nuclear Factor-κB and Activator Protein-1 activation, microRNA (miR)-221 and miR-222 induction, RECK suppression, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP2 and 9) activation, effects that were reversed by minocycline. Notably, minocycline induced RECK expression dose-dependently within the therapeutic dose of 1–100 μM, and silencing RECK partially reversed the inhibitory effects of minocycline on PDGF-BB-induced MMP activation, and SMC proliferation and migration. Further, targeting MMP2 and MMP9 blunted PDGF-BB-induced SMC migration. Together, these results demonstrate that minocycline inhibits PDGF-BB-induced SMC proliferation and migration by restoring RECK, an MMP inhibitor. These results indicate that the induction of RECK is one of the mechanisms by which minocycline exerts vasculoprotective effects. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Migration; Mitogenesis; MMP; PDGF; RECK; Restenosis; Vascular proliferative diseases",Article,Scopus

Moreover, abnormal expression of UDG is related to various cancers and other serious diseases. Therefore, it is essential to accurately and sensitively monitor UDG activity. In this work, a ratiometric fluorescence method using poly-(thymine) DNA template copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) as the output signals is developed for simple, selective, and sensitive detection of UDG. A double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) consisting of a uracil-containing single chain and a trigger sequence is designed as a substrate dsDNA. Meanwhile, another dsDNA comprising 30 pairs of A-T bases ((AT) 30 dsDNA) is designed to be partially complementary to the trigger chain. The (AT) 30 dsDNA itself has no blunt or recessed 3′ end and cannot be cut by exonuclease III (Exo III). With the Exo III-assisted amplification, adding UDG results in the success synthesis of red-emissive Cu NCs, while the dsDNAs in the system are hydrolyzed and the fluorescence signal of DAPI is weak. In contrast, without addition of UDG, the fluorescence intensity of Cu NCs is low, while the DAPI emits significantly enhanced fluorescence signal. The proposed method presents a detection limit of 5.0 × 10 −5 U mL −1 and can be applied to the HeLa cell lysate sample with satisfactory results. Additionally, the kinetic parameter is studied and the UDG inhibition effect is evaluated. In summary, this work provides a potential platform for DNA repair enzyme-related analysis and clinical diagnosis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","DAPI; Exo III-assisted amplification; Poly-(thymine) templated copper nanoclusters; Ratiometric fluorescent sensor; Uracil-DNA glycosylase",Article,Scopus

Accumulating evidence demonstrated that promoter methylation of tumor-suppressor genes is implicated in the pathogenesis of melanoma. In the current study, we performed a meta-analysis to identify promising methylation biomarkers in the diagnosis of melanoma. We carried out a systematic literature search using Pubmed, Embase, and ISI web knowledge database and found that gene promoter methylation of 50 genes was reported to be associated with the risk of melanoma.

The combination of these modalities, traditionally done using intensity-based registration algorithms, leads to a more accurate diagnosis and treatment, due to the capability of co-localizing lesions and susceptibles areas between the two image modalities. In this work, we present the first attempt to register breast MRI and X-ray mammographic images using intensity gradients as the similarity measure. Specifically, a patient-specific biomechanical model of the breast, extracted from the MRI image, is used to mimic the mammographic acquisition. The intensity gradients of the glandular tissue are directly projected from the 3D MRI volume to the 2D mammographic space, and two different gradient-based metrics are tested to lead the registration, the normalized cross-correlation of the scalar gradient values and the gradient correlation of the vectoral gradients. We compare these two approaches to an intensity-based algorithm, where the MRI volume is transformed to a synthetic computed tomography (pseudo-CT) image using the partial volume effect obtained by the glandular tissue segmentation performed by means of an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. This allows us to obtain the digitally reconstructed radiographies by a direct intensity projection. The best results are obtained using the scalar gradient approach along with a transversal isotropic material model, obtaining a target registration error (TRE), in millimeters, of 5.65 ± 2.76 for CC- and of 7.83 ± 3.04 for MLO-mammograms, while the TRE is 7.33 ± 3.62 in the 3D MRI. We also evaluate the effect of the glandularity of the breast as well as the landmark position on the TRE, obtaining moderated correlation values (0.65 and 0.77 respectively), concluding that these aspects need to be considered to increase the accuracy in further approaches. © 2019 The Authors","Breast cancer; MRI; Multimodal registration; X-ray mammography",Article,Scopus

Mitochondrial matrix pyridine nucleotides are potent regulators of the PTP, but the role of extramitochondrial nucleotides is unclear. Methods: The PTP opening was explored in isolated mitochondria and mitochondria in permeabilized differentiated and undifferentiated cells in the presence of added NAD(P)(H) in combination with Mg 2+ , adenine nucleotides (AN), and the inhibitors of AN translocase (ANT), voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), and cyclophilin D. Results: Added NAD(H) and AN, but not NADP(H), inhibited the PTP opening with comparable potency. PTP suppression required neither NAD(H) oxidation nor reduction. The protective effects of NAD(H) and cyclosporin A were synergistic, and the effects of NAD(H) and millimolar AN were additive. The conformation-specific ANT inhibitors were unable to cancel the protective effect of NADH even under total ANT inhibition. Besides, NAD(H) activated the efflux of mitochondrial AN via ANT. VDAC ligand (Mg 2+ ) and blockers (G3139 and 4,4′-diisothiocyano-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid) potentiated and attenuated the protective effect of NAD(H), respectively. However, in embryonic and cancer (undifferentiated) cells, in contrast to isolated differentiated hepatocytes and cardiocytes, the suppression of PTP opening by NADH was negligible though all cells tested possessed a full set of VDAC isoforms. Conclusions: The study revealed a novel mechanism of PTP regulation by external (cytosolic) NAD(H) through the allosteric site in the OM or the intermembrane space. General significance: The mechanism might contribute to the resistance of differentiated cells under different pathological conditions including ischemia/reperfusion. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","ATP; Differentiated cells; External site; NADH; Permeability transition pore; Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase",Article,Scopus

Few studies have discussed best practice with respect to diagnosis and treatment in children. Objective: To present our institution's experience with the evaluation and management of pediatric mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the head and neck. Methods: Retrospective chart review of patients under 20 years of age diagnosed with mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the head and neck between 1998 and 2017. Data assessed includes demographics, clinical presentation, imaging examinations, histopathology, treatment, complications, local recurrence, distant metastasis, and follow-up. Results: Sixteen patients (10 female, 6 male) were identified with a median age of 12.9 (IQR: 10.9–15.0) years. Tumors were located within the parotid gland (n = 11, 68.8%), accessory lobe of the parotid gland (n = 2, 12.5%), palate (n = 2, 12.5%), and submandibular region (n = 1, 6.3%). In 9 patients (56.3%) a neoplastic etiology was suspected based on the clinical and/or radiographic findings and confirmed pathologically on biopsy or excision. All patients were treated surgically and five patients required adjuvant radiotherapy. One patient had recurrence requiring re-excision. Seven patients (43.8%) had transient facial paresis post-operatively and one had Frey syndrome. Median follow-up time was 59.7 months (IQR: 18.9–99.3). Conclusion: The malignant nature of mucoepidermoid carcinoma requires comprehensive, multidisciplinary management. Imaging and tissue sampling by fine needle aspiration give clinicians the best insight into location and nature of the mass.

The upgraded program of HIRFL aimed to provide all ions from protons to uranium for higher beam intensity. As one of subprojects upgrade program in HIRFL, the low-level radio frequency (LLRF) system is also completely redesigned to better stabilize the beam acceleration parameters during the machine operation. The purpose of this article is to describe the design and implementation of the new fully digital LLRF system for six sets of radio frequency (RF) systems at the HIRFL. All components, including the quadrature demodulation, phase and amplitude detectors, phase shifter, and proportional integral (PI) loop filter, were designed in detail and realized in field programmable gate array (FPGA). A special synchronous RF source was designed to provide a phase reference for the different RF systems. A new tuning system was designed to ensure that the RF system remains in a good working state. An economical compensation method for the temperature drift in the pick-up cables was designed to improve the control accuracy of the system. The new LLRF systems have passed a 24 h high power test on the HIRFL cavities. The phase stabilization control accuracy was |Δϕ|≤0.2 o , and the amplitude fluctuation was |ΔA|≤2∗10 −3 . Compared with the original analog system, the control precision and stability have been improved by an order of magnitude. The extraction beam energy of SFC was measured, and its stability is better than 4.3∗10 −3 , after this LLRF system is applied successfully. © 2019","Digital down conversion; LLRF; Phase modulation suppression; PI filter; Temperature drift compensation",Article,Scopus

The fraction of killed cells after each treatment can quantify the therapeutic effect and plays as a helpful tool to evaluate the chemotherapy treatment schedules. In the present study, an image-based spatio-temporal computational model of a solid tumor is provided for calculation of interstitial fluid flow and solute transport. Current model incorporates heterogeneous microvasculature for angiogenesis instead of synthetic mathematical modeling. In this modeling process, a comprehensive model according to Convection-Diffusion-Reaction (CDR) equations is employed due to its high accuracy for simulating the binding and the uptake of the drug by tumor cells. Based on the velocity and the pressure distribution, transient distribution of the different drug concentrations (free, bound, and internalized) is calculated. Then, the fraction of killed cells is obtained according to the internalized concentration. Results indicate the dependence of the drug distribution on both time and space, as well as the microvasculature density. Free and bound drug concentration have the same trend over time, whereas, internalized and total drug concentration increases over time and reaches a constant value. The highest amount of concentration occurred in the tumor region due to the higher permeability of the blood vessels. Moreover, the fraction of killed cells is approximately 78.87% and 24.94% after treatment with doxorubicin for cancerous and normal tissues, respectively. In general, the presented methodology may be applied in the field of personalized medicine to optimize patient-specific treatments.

Hormone remission was associated with decreased degrees of pre-operative internal carotid artery (ICA) contact and Knosp score (p ≤ 0.02) on all sequences except for Knosp score on T2WI. On receiver operating characteristic analysis, the area under curve for differentiating endocrine remission ranged from 0.88 to 0.92 for Knosp score and 0.85–0.93 for ICA contact, depending on sequence. Conclusion: Extent of pituitary adenoma cavernous sinus invasion as measured by degrees of ICA contact and Knosp score is associated with postoperative endocrine outcomes. Given improved image quality, inclusion of CE-CISS may be helpful for pre-surgical planning. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","CISS/FIESTA; Knosp score; Pituitary adenoma; VIBE/FAME/LAVA",Article,Scopus

Cultivated limbal epithelial transplantation is the current treatment of choice for restoring the loss or dysfunction of LESCs. To perform this procedure, a substratum is necessary for in vitro culturing of limbal epithelial cells and their subsequent transplantation onto the ocular surface. In this work, we evaluated poly-L/DL-lactic acid 70:30 (PLA) films functionalized with type IV collagen (col IV) as potential in vitro carrier substrata for LESCs. We first demonstrated that PLA-col IV films were biocompatible and suitable for the proliferation of human corneal epithelial cells. Subsequently, limbal epithelial cell suspensions, isolated from human limbal rings, were cultivated using culture medium that did not contain animal components. The cells adhered significantly faster to PLA-col IV films than to tissue culture plastic (TCP). The mRNA expression levels for the LESC specific markers, K15, P63α and ABCG2 were similar or greater (significantly in the case of K15) in limbal epithelial cells cultured on PLA-col IV films than limbal epithelial cells cultured on TCP. The percentage of cells expressing the corneal (K3, K12) and the LESC (P63α ABCG2) specific markers was similar for both substrata. These results suggest that the PLA-col IV films promoted LESC attachment and helped to maintain their undifferentiated stem cell phenotype. Consequently, these substrata offer an alternative for the transplantation of limbal cells onto the ocular surface. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Collagen IV; Corneal epithelium; Limbal stem cells; Polylactic acid; Tissue engineering",Article,Scopus

Obtaining comprehensive clinical follow-up can be difficult and time-intensive for proton centers. Here we evaluate what factors affect maximum follow-up time among MGH Pediatric Proton Consortium Registry (PPCR) participants. Patients and methods: Enrollment in the PPCR was offered to any patient <22 years receiving protons. Patients were excluded from analysis if they were taken off study due to death or withdrawal. Distance from MGH was calculated by the great-circle formula. We utilized both univariate and multivariate analyses to determine risk factors associated with follow-up time. Results: 333 PPCR patients enrolled between 10/2012 and 03/2017 were included. Median follow-up was 2.4 years (<1–5.5), and median distance away from the proton center was 256.4 km (<1.6–16,949.6). Distance from MGH significantly predicted follow-up time: patients living outside the Boston Metropolitan Statistical Area, >121 km from the proton center, had average follow-up that was 0.53 years less compared to those living within 121 km (p = 0.0002). Loss in average follow-up was also associated with Medicaid insurance, treatment delay due to insurance, and non-White race. Those co-enrolled on a proton trial or seen at a facility had significantly increased follow-up by almost one year (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Patients living further from treating proton center have shorter follow-up durations. Increased distance from treating centers may adversely affect clinical outcomes research. Enhanced sharing of medical information among care providers and improved collection methods are needed to effectively evaluate the benefits of proton therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Distance from treatment center; Follow-up; Pediatric oncology; Proton; Radiotherapy; Registry",Article,Scopus

However, performing two imaging modalities may increase radiation exposure by double. Two-dimensional reconstructed images created from DBT with 2DSM, has a potential to replace conventional FFDM in concerning both radiation dosage and image quality. With increasing concerns for individual radiation exposure, studies analyzing radiation dosage in breast imaging modalities are needed. This study compared radiation dosage and image quality between DBT + 2DSM versus FFDM. Methods and materials: 374 patients (mean age 52 years) who underwent both DBT and FFDM were retrospectively reviewed. Radiation dosage data were obtained by radiation dosage scoring and monitoring program Radimetrics (Bayer HealthCare, Whippany, NJ). Entrance dose and mean glandular doses in each breast were obtained for both modalities. To compare image quality of DBT + 2DSM and FFDM, a 5-point scoring system for lesion clarity was assessed. The parameters of radiation dosage (entrance dose, mean glandular dose) and image quality (lesion clarity scoring) were compared. Results: For entrance dose, DBT had lower mean dosage (14.8 mGy) compared with FFDM (21.8 mGy, p-value < 0.0001). Mean glandular doses for both breasts were lower in DBT (Left 1.74, Right 2.1) compared with FFDM (Left 2.85, Right 2.74, p-value < 0.0001). Lesion clarity score was higher in DBT with 2DSM (mean score 4.03) compared with FFDM (3.82, p-value < 0.0001). Conclusion: DBT showed lower radiation entrance dose and mean glandular doses to both breasts compared with FFDM. DBT + 2DSM had better image quality than FFDM, suggesting that DBT with 2DSM has potential as an alternative to FFDM. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","2-Dimensional synthetic mammography; Digital breast tomosynthesis; Full-field digital mammography; Image quality; Radiation dose; Radimetrics",Article,Scopus

However, accurate, efficient, and replicable models of quantifying adiposity have yet to be developed and clinically implemented. We propose a novel semiautomated radiologic method of measuring the visceral fat area (VFA) using computed tomography scan analysis. Materials and methods: We obtained a cohort of 100 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma, with a median age of 60.9 y (age range: 35-87 y) and an average body mass index of 28.8 kg/m 2 ± 6.56 kg/m 2 . The semiautomated quantification method of adiposity was developed using a commercial imaging suite. The method was compared to two manual delineations performed using two different picture archiving communication systems. We quantified VFA, subcutaneous fat area (SFA), total fat area (TFA), and visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio (V/S ratio) on computed tomography axial slices that were at the L4-L5 intervertebral level. Results: The semiautomated method was comparable to manual measurements for TFA, VFA, and SFA with intraclass correlation (ICC) of 0.99, 0.97, and 0.96, respectively. However, the ICC for the V/S ratio was only 0.44, which led to the identification of technical outliers that were identified using robust regression. After removal of these outliers, the ICC improved to 0.99 for TFA, VFA, and SFA and 0.97 for the V/S ratio. Measurements from the manual methodology highly correlated between the two picture archiving communication system platforms, with ICC of 0.98 for TFA, 0.98 for VFA, 0.96 for SFA, and 0.95 for the V/S ratio. Conclusions: This semiautomated method is able to generate precise and reproducible results. In the future, this method may be applied on a larger scale to facilitate risk stratification of patients using measures of abdominal adiposity. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Abdominal adiposity; Automated method; CT scan; Subcutaneous fat area; Total fat area; Visceral fat area",Article,Scopus

Previous studies have observed lead increases blood pressure over time. However, the role of other metal contaminants and essential micronutrients, which could also adversely affect blood pressure or act as protective factors, is understudied. Objectives: We therefore evaluated the associations of lead, manganese, and selenium with blood and pulse pressure trajectories. Methods: We prospectively followed placebo-assigned participants nested within a randomized trial for the prevention of arsenic-related skin cancer (n = 255). Blood lead, manganese, and selenium were measured at baseline; blood pressure was measured at baseline and at 3 biennial follow-up examinations. Mixed-effect linear regression models were used to estimate associations with average annual changes in systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure. Results: In models simultaneously adjusted for baseline blood lead, manganese, and selenium concentrations in addition to other potential confounders, lead was linearly associated with increases in systolic blood pressure, but not with diastolic blood pressure or pulse pressure. A non-linear association was observed for manganese, such that mid-range concentrations were associated with decreases in systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure. Baseline selenium concentrations in the highest quartile were also associated with longitudinal decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, while null associations were observed with pulse pressure. In exploratory analyses, the combination of mid-range manganese and high selenium concentrations completely offset lead-associated increases in blood and pulse pressure. Conclusions: The results indicate a direct, linear association of lead exposure with systolic blood pressure, and manganese and selenium exposures within certain ranges may have a blood pressure-lowering effect in this population. The findings of this study suggest toxic lead exposures remain a significant public health problem in Bangladesh where high levels are associated with high blood pressure; however, the nutritionally essential micronutrients manganese and selenium appear to confer protection from the hypertensive effects of lead. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bangladesh; Blood pressure; Essential metals; Pulse pressure; Toxic metals",Article,Scopus

Previously, we reported that expression of interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP), also known as interferon regulatory factor-8, is positively correlated with TGF-β type I receptor (TGF-β RI) expression in osteosarcoma patient tissues. In this study, we demonstrated that ICSBP upregulated TGF-β RI and induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-like phenomena in human osteosarcoma cell lines. As determined by soft agar growth of osteosarcoma cells and xenografted mouse models, ICSBP increased tumorigenicity, which was reversed by ICSBP knock-down or a TGF-β RI inhibitor. To test whether ICSBP directly regulates the promoter activity of TGF-β RI, we performed a TGF-β RI promoter assay, an electro mobility shift assay, and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that TGF-β RI promoter was activated in ICSBP-overexpressing osteosarcoma cells. Exploiting serial deletions and mutations of the TGF-β RI promoter, we found a putative ICSBP-binding site at nucleotides −216/−211 (GGXXTC) in the TGF-β RI promoter. Our data suggest that ICSBP upregulates TGF-β RI expression by binding to this site, causing ICSBP-mediated tumor progression in osteosarcoma cells. In addition, we found a positive correlation between ICSBP and TGF-β RI expression in several types of tumors using the cBioportal database. We demonstrated that interferon consensus sequence-binding protein upregulates transforming growth factor-beta type I receptor (TGF-β RI) expression by binding to nucleotides −216/−211 (GGXXTC) in the TGF-β RI promoter, which resulted in increased tumorigenicity and tumor progression in human osteosarcoma cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Interferon consensus sequence-binding protein; Osteosarcoma progression; Promoter activation; Transforming growth factor-beta type I receptor",Article,Scopus

Therefore, the use of amphiphilic nanoplatforms to the transport of these drugs through the bloodstream is a challenge. While the hydrophobic region interacts with the drug, the hydrophilic outer layer enhances its bioavailability and circulation time. Poly (ethylene glycol)-block-poly(ε-caprolactone) PEG-b-PCL micelles are biodegradable and biocompatible, allowing its use as a nanocarrier for drug delivery systems. The stealth property of PEG that composes the outer layer of nanoplatforms, makes the micelle unperceivable to phagocytic cells, increasing the circulation time in the human body. In addition, folic acid functionalization enables micelle selectively targeting to cancer cells, improving treatment efficiency and reducing side effects. In this work, PEG-b-PCL copolymer was synthesized by ring opening polymerization (ROP) of the ε-caprolactone with Poly(ethylene glycol) as a macroinitiator and tin(II) 2-ethyl hexanoate as a catalyst. Functionalization of such micelles with folic acid occurred through the modification of the PEG terminal group. The surface modification of the copolymer micelles resulted in higher critical micellar concentration (CMC), increasing approximately 100 times. The synthesis of the copolymers resulted in molecular weight around 3000 g mol −1 with low polydispersity. The polymer micelles have a hydrodynamic diameter in the range of 100–200 nm and the functionalized sample doesn't show aggregation in the considered pH range. High incorporation efficiency was obtained with a minimum percentage of 85%. The drug release profile and linearization from the Peppas model confirmed the interaction of methotrexate with the hydrophobic segment of the copolymer and its release mechanism by relaxation and/or degradation of the chains, making PEG-b-PCL micelles suitable candidates for hydrophobic drug delivery systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Copolymer micelles; Methotrexate; PEG-b-PCL; Targeted drug delivery",Article,Scopus

In current clinical practice, OAR contouring is performed with low levels of automation. Although several approaches have been proposed in the literature for improving automation, it is difficult to gain an understanding of how well these methods would perform in a realistic clinical setting. This is chiefly due to three key factors – small number of patient studies used for evaluation, lack of performance evaluation as a function of input image quality, and lack of precise anatomic definitions of OARs. In this paper, extending our previous body-wide Automatic Anatomy Recognition (AAR) framework to RT planning of OARs in the head and neck (H&N) and thoracic body regions, we present a methodology called AAR-RT to overcome some of these hurdles. AAR-RT follows AAR's 3-stage paradigm of model-building, object-recognition, and object-delineation. Model-building: Three key advances were made over AAR. (i) AAR-RT (like AAR) starts off with a computationally precise definition of the two body regions and all of their OARs. Ground truth delineations of OARs are then generated following these definitions strictly. We retrospectively gathered patient data sets and the associated contour data sets that have been created previously in routine clinical RT planning from our Radiation Oncology department and mended the contours to conform to these definitions. We then derived an Object Quality Score (OQS) for each OAR sample and an Image Quality Score (IQS) for each study, both on a 1-to-10 scale, based on quality grades assigned to each OAR sample following 9 key quality criteria. Only studies with high IQS and high OQS for all of their OARs were selected for model building. IQS and OQS were employed for evaluating AAR-RT's performance as a function of image/object quality. (ii) In place of the previous hand-crafted hierarchy for organizing OARs in AAR, we devised a method to find an optimal hierarchy for each body region. Optimality was based on minimizing object recognition error. (iii) In addition to the parent-to-child relationship encoded in the hierarchy in previous AAR, we developed a directed probability graph technique to further improve recognition accuracy by learning and encoding in the model “steady” relationships that may exist among OAR boundaries in the three orthogonal planes. Object-recognition: The two key improvements over the previous approach are (i) use of the optimal hierarchy for actual recognition of OARs in a given image, and (ii) refined recognition by making use of the trained probability graph. Object-delineation: We use a kNN classifier confined to the fuzzy object mask localized by the recognition step and then fit optimally the fuzzy mask to the kNN-derived voxel cluster to bring back shape constraint on the object. We evaluated AAR-RT on 205 thoracic and 298 H&N (total 503) studies, involving both planning and re-planning scans and a total of 21 organs (9 – thorax, 12 – H&N). The studies were gathered from two patient age groups for each gender – 40–59 years and 60–79 years. The number of 3D OAR samples analyzed from the two body regions was 4301. IQS and OQS tended to cluster at the two ends of the score scale. Accordingly, we considered two quality groups for each gender – good and poor. Good quality data sets typically had OQS ≥ 6 and had distortions, artifacts, pathology etc. in not more than 3 slices through the object. The number of model-worthy data sets used for training were 38 for thorax and 36 for H&N, and the remaining 479 studies were used for testing AAR-RT. Accordingly, we created 4 anatomy models, one each for: Thorax male (20 model-worthy data sets), Thorax female (18 model-worthy data sets), H&N male (20 model-worthy data sets), and H&N female (16 model-worthy data sets). On “good” cases, AAR-RT's recognition accuracy was within 2 voxels and delineation boundary distance was within ∼1 voxel. This was similar to the variability observed between two dosimetrists in manually contouring 5–6 OARs in each of 169 studies. On “poor” cases, AAR-RT's errors hovered around 5 voxels for recognition and 2 voxels for boundary distance. The performance was similar on planning and replanning cases, and there was no gender difference in performance. AAR-RT's recognition operation is much more robust than delineation. Understanding object and image quality and how they influence performance is crucial for devising effective object recognition and delineation algorithms. OQS seems to be more important than IQS in determining accuracy. Streak artifacts arising from dental implants and fillings and beam hardening from bone pose the greatest challenge to auto-contouring methods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,Article,Scopus

Herein, we show that lnc-DILC is upregulated in gallbladder CSCs and GBC patients’ tissues. Knockdown of lnc-DILC attenuates the self-renewal, tumorigenicity, proliferation and metastasis of gallbladder CSCs. Mechanistically, lnc-DILC promotes gallbladder CSCs expansion via Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Special Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor FH535 diminishes the discrepancy of self-renewal, growth and metastasis between lnc-DILC interference GBC cells and their control cells.

However, most photosensitizers are administered intravenously with very few reports about pulmonary applications. To address this issue, an inhalable formulation consisting of nanoparticles loaded with photosensitizer (i.e. curcumin) was developed. The nanoparticles were prepared using nanoprecipitation method. Dynamic light scattering measurements of the curcumin loaded nanoparticles revealed a hydrodynamic diameter of 181.20 ± 11.52 nm. In vitro irradiation experiments with human lung epithelial carcinoma cells (A549) showed a selective cellular toxicity of the nanoparticles upon activation using LED irradiating device. Moreover, curcumin nanoparticles exhibited a dose-dependent photocytotoxicity and the IC 50 values of curcumin were directly dependent on the radiation fluence used. The nanoparticles were subsequently spray dried using mannitol as a stabilizer to produce Nano-in-Microparticles with appropriate aerodynamic properties for a sufficient deposition in the lungs. This was confirmed using the next generation impactor, which revealed a large fine particle fraction (64.94 ± 3.47%) and a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 3.02 ± 0.07 μm. Nano-in-Microparticles exhibited a good redispersibility and disintegrated into the original nanoparticles upon redispersion in aqueous medium. The Langmuir monolayer experiments revealed an excellent compatibility of the nanoparticles with the lung surfactant.

In this study, we explored the clinical significance of Histone demethylase KDM5B gene and its effects on paclitaxel (PTX) sensitivity in EC. Method: First, we found that KDM5B expression significantly higher in EC tissues and cell lines. The elevated KDM5B expression was associated with high pathological grade and low PTX sensitivity. The functional role of KDM5B in PTX-resistant Ishikawa-R and HEC1A-R cells were examined by gene silencing experiments. Results: Knockdown of KDM5B resulted in the re-sensitization towards paclitaxel in both resistant cell lines. In addition, we also identified that microRNA-29c-3p (a tumor suppressor) was significantly lower in the EC cells and linked to the low PTX sensitivity of EC. The up-regulation of miR-29c-3p using exogenous mimic molecules markedly increased PTX sensitivity in both cell lines and reduced expression of KDM5B while the inhibitor of miR-29-3p resulted in the opposite effects. Notably, we also demonstrated that the level of miR-29c-3p was inversely correlated to the invasive, colony-forming abilities and PTX resistance in both cell lines. We also identified that miR-29c-3p has a binding site in the 3′UTR of the KDM5B gene, establishing a link of this signaling axis. In conclusion, high-expression of KDM5B is associated with the poor response to PTX in EC patients. Silencing of KDM5B led to the reversal of PTX resistance through miR-29c-3p/KDM5B pathway in EC. Conclusion: Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism by which EC cells acquire paclitaxel resistance and potential this signaling as a theronostic marker for this malignancy. © 2019","Endometrial carcinoma; KDM5B; miR-29c-39; Paclitaxel resistance; Theronostic marker",Article,Scopus

In neutral solution and without UV light irradiation, the azobenzene component on functional stalks was in trans form, and combined with α-CD to block the mesoporous channels and prevent the cargo from escaping. Upon adjusting the solution pH to acid range, the acid-sensitive hydrazone bonds rapidly hydrolyzed, resulting in the disconnection between pseudorotaxanes and MSNs. The encapsulated cargo molecules were released simultaneously from MSNPs 1 due to the removal of supramolecular switches. On the other hand, when the neutral solution was irradiated with UV light at 365 nm, trans-azobenzene converted to cis, disassociating with α-CD to activate the switches and release the cargo.

Cancer pathogenesis has been associated with genetic alterations that may lead to inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is frequently deleted or inactivated in various tumors. A recently discovered variant of PTEN, PTEN-Long (PTEN-L), results from an alternative translation initiation site located upstream of the canonic AUG and generates a protein of 576 amino acids instead the expected protein of 403 amino acids. A 16 bp perfect palindromic motif centered on the PTEN-L CUG 513 start codon is required for translation initiation. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of PTEN-L gene rs12573787 is located on the first exon respect to the CUG initiation site. In this case-control study we evaluated the association of genetic variants in PTEN-L with CML risk and therapy response in the Argentine population. The allele A of SNP rs12573787 was found to be associated with CML risk OR (95% CI) 1.71 (1.11–2.63) p = 0.016, which resulted consistent by multivariate analysis adjusted by gender and age. According to previous evidence that CML is more frequent in males, we found that the genetic risk of CML was confined to this gender. Unexpectedly, we also found this association confined to CML patients older than 45 years old. To our knowledge, this is the first time that PTEN-L rs1257378 was studied in CML suggesting that the variant A allele is a risk factor for CML development but, no association with the failure to TKIs treatment was found. © 2019","BCR-ABL1; Chronic myeloid leukemia; Polymorphism; PTEN-Long",Article,Scopus

However, the use of these NPs still runs into limitations mainly because of the low efficiency of environmental friendly synthesis methods and lack of size standardization. When NPs are release in the environment, they can be transformed by oxidation, adsorption or aggregation. These modification shows a dual role in toxic response of AgNPs. The adsorption of natural organic matter from environment on AgNPs, for example, can decrease their toxicity. Otherwise oxidation occurred in the environment is also able to increase the release of toxic Ag+ from NPs. Thus, the current review proposes an integrated approach of AgNP synthetic methods using bacteria, fungi, and plants, AgNP cytotoxic and genotoxic effects as well as their potential therapeutic applications are also presented. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","AgNPs; Cytotoxicity; Environmental transformation; Genotoxicity; Green chemistry; Therapeutic approaches",Review,Scopus

Ubiquitous humic acid (HA) can act as electron acceptor and be reduced by bacterial under such conditions, and the reduced form of humic acid (RHA) plays an important role in the photolysis contaminants. In this study, anaerobic 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) photodegradation was performed along with biodegradation by Shewanella putrefaciens mediated by HA. The mechanism of such coupled photolysis and biodegradation of EE2 was thus elucidated. The removal rate in such coupled degradation in the presence of 10 mgC L−1 of HA at pH 8.0 was greater than that of either photolysis or biodegradation alone. HA which had been reduced in a double-chamber microbial fuel cell showed better promotion to EE2 photodegradation than fresh HA. Reactive species scavenging experiments indicated that hydroxyl radical and excited triplet states of HA were primary contributors to EE2 photodegradation in anaerobic conditions. More of them were produced from RHA than from pristine HA. Besides, the degraded EE2 solutions inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 human cancer Cells.

Similarly, human clinical specimens showed highest LIMK2 levels in CRPC tissues compared to other stages, while minimal LIMK2 was observed in normal prostates.

Although DIM has been reported to exhibit anticancer properties against multiple tumor types, the direct target proteins of DIM have not been fully investigated. In the present study, we report that DIM is a novel COX1/2 and ERK1/2 inhibitor that suppresses growth of colon cancer in vitro and in vivo. To identify possible molecular targets of DIM, 11 potential candidate proteins were validated by an in vitro kinase or enzyme assay. We found that DIM directly inhibits COX1/2 and ERK1/2 protein activities in vitro. Additionally, the PGE2 production (COX-mediated metabolite) and phosphorylated RSK expression (ERK1/2 direct downstream kinase) were strongly suppressed by DIM in colon cancer cells. The inhibition of cell growth by DIM is dependent on the expression of COX1/2 or ERK1/2 proteins. Notably, oral administration of DIM suppressed patient-derived xenograft colon tumor growth in an in vivo mouse model. Overall these results suggest that DIM is a potent and dual COX1/2 and ERK1/2 inhibitor that might be used for chemotherapy against colon cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Colon cancer; COX1/2; DIM; ERK1/2; Patient-derived xenograft",Article,Scopus

As a tumor-homing ligand, internalizing RGD peptide (iRGD), composed of a tumor-targeting sequence (RGD) and a cell-penetrating C-end Rule (CendR) motif, is known to facilitate the tumor-specific delivery of payloads that are covalently conjugated on its N-terminal fragment or co-administered without any covalent linkages. However, theranostic uses of the iRGD-based platform remain in its infancy with its full potential unexplored; for instance, detailed mechanism of iRGD fragmentation during internalization, strategies for the tumor-specific release of payloads from iRGD and the role of the C-terminal iRGD fragment in delivery have yet to be revealed. In this study, we designed a dual-channel fluorescent cyclic iRGD (TAMRA-iRGDC-Cy5.5) to track each of the N- and C-terminal fragments separately during the tumor internalization process. It turned out that both fragments undergo translocation into cancer cells together and are localized within endosomal-lysosomal compartments. The resulting co-internalization of both iRGD fragments allowed us to develop a new theranostic peptide platform (Cy5.5-iRGDC-Pt(IV)) by conjugating a fluorescent dye and a cisplatin prodrug on each terminus of cyclic iRGD for simultaneous cancer-targeted imaging and therapy. Compared to a control peptide having a non-iRGD sequence, the Cy5.5-iRGDC-Pt(IV) did not only provide a better tumor imaging contrast but also induced tumor-specific apoptosis leading to efficacious tumor suppression. Besides the outstanding cancer imaging and therapeutic performance, the Cy5.5-iRGDC-Pt(IV) revealed negligible systemic toxicity, holding potential to be applied for theranostic uses. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cancer imaging and therapy; CendR pathway; Cisplatin prodrug; Internalizing iRGD; Theranostic peptide",Article,Scopus

In this study, we took advantage of a natural biomineralization process to create aluminum-containing nanoZIF-8 particles for antigen delivery. Without organic solvents or stabilizing agent, nanoparticles (ZANPs) were synthesized by a mild and facile method with aluminum, model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) and ZIF-8 integrated.

A Toll-like receptor 9 agonist cytosine-phosphate-guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG) was adsorbed on the surface of ZANPs (hereafter CpG/ZANPs) to boost the immune response. After subcutaneous injection in vivo, CpG/ZANPs targeted lymph nodes (LNs), where their cargo was efficiently internalized by LN-resident antigen-presenting cells (APCs). ZANPs decomposition in lysosomes released antigen into the cytoplasm and enhanced cross-presentation. Moreover, CpG/ZANPs induced strong antigen-specific humoral and cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses that significantly inhibited the growth of EG7-OVA tumors while showing minimal cytotoxicity.

Prolyl-4-hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), one member of PHDs family, regulates the stability of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) in response to oxygen availability. During hypoxia, the inhibition of PHD2 permits the accumulation of HIF-1α, allowing the cellular adaptation to oxygen limitation, causing activation of numerous genes, which enhances the angiogenesis, metastasis and invasiveness. Accurate regulation of oxygen homeostasis is essential, and which implies PHD2 may have a regulatory role in the pathogenesis of cancer. Although ample evidence exists for a positive correlation between HIFs and tumor formation, metastasis and poor prognosis, the function of the PHD2 in carcinogenesis is less well understood. Despite their original role as the oxygen sensors of the cell and many of the its functions are clearly conveyed through the HIF system, PHD2 is currently known to display HIF-independent and hydroxylase-independent functions in cancer cells and stroma in the control of different cellular pathways.

Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) allows the tumor cells to acquire increased migratory and invasive properties mediating their dissemination to faraway sites, thus favoring metastasis. With metastatic lung cancer claiming the majority of lung cancer-related deaths, agents targeting the pathways underlying metastasis are translationally promising. In the present study, we have explored the anti-metastatic effects of fisetin in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells A549 and H1299 with emphasis on EMT. The results suggested a significant inhibition in migration and invasion of NSCLC cells under non-cytotoxic concentrations. Furthermore, an attenuation of the EMT was observed in both the cell lines with upregulation in the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin in A549 cells and ZO-1 in H1299 cells with concomitant downregulation of the mesenchymal markers vimentin as well as N-cadherin along with invasion marker MMP-2.

Fisetin decreased the expression of multiple signaling proteins (β-catenin, NF-κB, EGFR, STAT-3) acting upstream to EMT and known to be involved in induction and maintenance of mesenchymal phenotype, which may explain the observed effects. Moreover, fisetin decreased the ability of H1299 cells to form colonies on soft agar and potentiated the cytotoxic effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), erlotinib. Overall, our study suggested the ability of fisetin to serve as a potential therapeutic agent on its capacity to attenuate the EMT program and inhibit migration, invasion and stem cell phenotype of lung cancer cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CD133; CD44; EMT; Fisetin; Invasion; Migration; NSCLC",Article,Scopus

The arrest of cell cycle arrest and inhibition of cellular proliferation were associated with up regulation of p53 along with down regulation of Cyclin B1 and Cdk2 indicating a mitochondrial related induction of apoptosis with ZQT. A reversal of ZQT-induced apoptosis and G0⁄G1 arrest was observed with pifithrin-a pretreatment. ZQT was also found to suppress the progression of tumor growth in mouse xenograft models and prolong survival. In addition, no hepato- or nephro- or cardio-toxicity with ZQT treatment were detected in mice. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the ZQT formula inhibits the growth of NSCLC cells and is a potential agent of complementary and alternative treatment for lung cancer. © 2019","Apoptosis; NSCLC; P53; Traditional Chinese Medicine; Ze-Qi-Tang (ZQT)",Article,Scopus

Oxycodone is used to treat CIBP. However, the lack of understanding of the mechanism of CIBP limits the application of oxycodone. In this study, proteomic profiling of oxycodone-treated spinal dorsal cord of rats with CIBP was performed. Briefly, a total of 3519 proteins were identified in the Sham group; 3505 proteins in the CIBP group; and 3530 proteins in the CIBP-OXY treatment group. The 2-fold cut-off value was used as the differential protein standard for abundance reduction or increase (p < 0.05). Significant differences were found in the abundance of 16 proteins between Sham and CIBP group; 11 proteins in the CIBP group had increased abundance while 5 proteins had reduced abundance. Furthermore, fifteen proteins with differential abundance were identified between the CIBP group and the OXY group. Compared with the CIBP group, there were six increased abundances and nine reduced abundances in the OXY group. In addition, a reduced expression of ADP-ribosylation factor-like 6 binding factor 1 (Arl6ip-1), an endoplasmic reticulum protein that has an important role in cell conduction and material transport, was found in the CIBP group compared with the Sham group. Its expression increased after the administration of OXY. Proteomics results were further verified by Western-blot. Fluorescent staining revealed that Arl6ip-1 co-localized with spinal dorsal horn neurons, but not with astrocytes or microglia. Based on the observed results, we believe that Arl6ip-1 may be a potential drug target for OXY treatment of CIBP rats. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","ADP-ribosylation factor-like 6 binding factor 1; Cancer-induced bone pain; Oxycodone; Proteomics",Article,Scopus

Acute hyperexcitability causes cold-evoked sensory and motor symptoms, which resemble neuromyotonia. An accessible and non-invasive technique for early detection could help select patients for potential treatments. We assessed the use of a simple surface electromyography (sEMG) in patients directly after oxaliplatin infusion. Methods:In patients with colorectal cancer, acute neurotoxicity was evaluated by means of a physical examination, a questionnaire, and sEMG directly after the second and fourth cycle of oxaliplatin. Questionnaires were also assessed 1 day after infusion. Results: 14 patients were measured after the second cycle and 8 patients were also measured after the fourth cycle of oxaliplatin. All patients reported to a variable degree oxaliplatin induced neurotoxicity symptoms: sensitivity to touching cold or swallowing cold items were reported as most severe. Clinical signs of hyperexcitability were observed in 55% of the measurements. Spontaneous activity compatible with neuromyotonia was observed in 82% of the sEMG recordings. Conclusions: Patient reported symptoms, physical examination and simple sEMG are complementary measurements to detect acute oxaliplatin induced neurotoxicity. After further validation, sEMG recording can be used as a simple objective screenings tool to detect nerve hyperexcitability directly after oxaliplatin administration. © 2019 The Authors","Hyperexcitability; Oxaliplatin; Screening; Surface electromyography",Article,Scopus

By employing a stochastic cellular automata model, we simulated the development of tumorous neurospheres in response to transformation of a randomly selected progenitor cell into a brain tumor stem cell. Simulated tumorous neurospheres were distinguished from normal neurospheres by their size, which exceeded that of normal neurospheres typically manifold. A decisive factor that determined whether brain tumor stem cells gave rise to tumorous neurospheres was their ability to escape encapsulation by neighboring cells, which suppressed mitotic activity through contact inhibition. In our simulations, the likelihood of tumorigenesis was strongly negatively correlated with the developmental maturity of the neurospheres in which the transformation of a progenitor cell into a brain tumor stem cell was induced. This likelihood was furthermore modulated by the probability of the progeny of dividing cells to undergo cell death. In developmentally immature neurospheres, the number of normal neurospheres, relative to the number of tumorous neurospheres, increased with increasing cell death probability. Markedly, in developmentally mature neurospheres the opposite effect was observed. This dichotomous effect of cell death on simulated tumor progression provides theoretical support for the seemingly paradoxical finding made by other authors in experimental studies that anti-cancer therapies based on induction of apoptosis may both promote and suppress tumor growth. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Brain tumor stem cells; Neural stem/progenitor cells; Neurosphere assay; Theoretical modeling; Tumor growth",Article,Scopus

In particular emerging experimental evidence has associated alterations to DNA methylation status with healthspan and aging. Mammalian DNA methylation status is maintained by an intricate array of biochemical and molecular processes. It can be argued changes to these fundamental cellular processes ultimately drive the formation of aberrant DNA methylation patterns, which are a hallmark of diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease. In recent years mathematical models have been used as effective tools to help advance our understanding of the dynamics which underpin DNA methylation. In this paper we present linear and nonlinear models which encapsulate the dynamics of the molecular mechanisms which define DNA methylation. Applying a recently developed Bayesian algorithm for parameter estimation and model selection, we are able to estimate distributions of parameters which include nominal parameter values. Using limited noisy observations, the method also identified which methylation model the observations originated from, signaling that our method has practical applications in identifying what models best match the biological data for DNA methylation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CpG dyads; DNA methylation; Gene promoter; Model selection; Parameter estimation",Article,Scopus

Unfortunately these intensive chemotherapeutic regimes, often show disappointing results due to the development of drug resistance and higher nonspecific toxicity on normal tissues. In cancer treatment, it is critically important to minimize toxicity while preserving efficacy. We have previously addressed this issue and proposed a nanoparticle-based combination therapy involving both a molecularly targeted therapy and chemotherapeutic agent for neutralizing antiapoptotic survivin (BIRC5) to potentiate the efficacy of doxorubicin (DOX). Although the particles exhibited strong anticancer effect on the lung carcinoma A549 and the cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, there were lower-level therapeutic outcomes on the colon carcinoma HCT-116, the leukemia Jurkat and the pancreatic carcinoma MIA PaCa-2 cells. Since targeted therapies are one of the key approaches for overcoming drug resistance, tailoring the treatment of cancer cells with distinct characteristics is necessary to improve the therapeutic outcome of cancer therapy and to minimize potential pharmacokinetic interactions of drugs. In the light of this issue, this study examined whether a cascade therapy with low-dose DOX and survivin-targeted tailored nanoparticles is more effective at sensitizing HCT-116, Jurkat and MIA PaCa-2 cancer cells to DOX-chemotherapy than simultaneous combination therapy. The results demonstrated that the sequential therapy with the protocol comprising addition of the nanoparticles after incubation of cells with DOX clearly advanced the therapeutic outcome of related cancer cells, whereas the reverse protocol resulted in a reduction or delay in apoptosis, emphasizing the critical importance of formulating synergistic drug combinations in cancer therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Chemoresistance; Colon cancer; Doxorubicin; Leukemia; Nanoparticles; Pancreatic cancer; Survivin",Article,Scopus

It is suggested that TPA may induce apoptosis of breast cancer cells through mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.

However, its expression patterns and biological roles in human gastric cancers have not yet been characterized. In the current study, we found that Ajuba protein was increased in gastric cancer tissues and in cell lines. High Ajuba expression positively correlated with the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncomine microarray data mining also suggested that Ajuba mRNA upregulation in gastric cancer tissues. We used SGC-7901 and NCI-N87 cell lines for Ajuba overexpression and siRNA knockdown respectively. MTT and colony formation assays indicated that Ajuba overexpression increased proliferation rate and colony formation ability while Ajuba siRNA inhibited proliferation rate and colony formation ability. AnnexinV and JC1 staining showed that Ajuba downregulated cisplatin induced apoptosis while it upregulated mitochondrial membrane potential. Ajuba overexpression also inhibited caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, while Ajuba depletion showed the opposite effects. Notably, Ajuba enhanced glucose metabolism by upregulating glucose uptake, glucose consumption, lactate production and ATP production. We further revealed that Ajuba positively regulated cyclin D1, Bcl-xL and GLUT1 at both mRNA and protein levels. Analysis of TCGA dataset revealed that there were positive correlations between Ajuba and cyclin D1, Bcl-xL, GLUT1 at the mRNA levels. Further investigation demonstrated that Ajuba overexpression inhibited Hippo signaling by upregulating YAP protein expression. Depletion of YAP by siRNA abolished the effect of Ajuba on cyclin D1, Bcl-xL and GLUT1. Together, our study showed that Ajuba was overexpressed in human gastric cancers, where it increased cell growth and chemoresistance.

Methods: Ninety three patients underwent cystoscopy and bladder tumors were biopsied and histologically assessed. Data collected including: patient demographics and clinical characteristics. Biochemical markers: hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1 α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), Malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxy 2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and reduced glutathione (GSH) and molecular marker PDIA3 gene expression were measured. Results: According to the tumor grade and stage, 36 patients were found to have MIBC, 27 patients have non MIBC (NMIBC) and 30 patients have no bladder lesions (control group). PDIA3 gene expression level had the largest contribution to a multivariable model for predicting BC, which achieved 89.0% predictive accuracy. The AUC for discriminating MIBC significantly increased from 0.644 to 0.938 when biochemical markers were replaced by molecular PDIA3 marker in the final model.

The role of neurotransmitter release in the expression of cognitive impairments is not well known. In this work we employed a newly developed behavioral paradigm to measure attentional shifting, a fundamental component of executive function, in rats treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a commonly used cancer chemotherapy agent. We found that one and two weeks of 5-FU treatment significantly impaired attentional shifting compared to baseline, while saline treatment had no effect. Post-mortem analysis of these rats revealed that 5-FU caused a significant overall decrease in dopamine release as well. Collectively, these results demonstrate the feasibility of our attentional shifting paradigm for evaluating the cognitive effects of chemotherapy treatment. Moreover, these results support the need for additional studies to determine if impaired dopamine release plays a role in chemobrain. © 2019","5-fluorouracil; Chemobrain; Dopamine; Executive function; Voltammetry",Article,Scopus

Recently, a few Rho GTPase activating proteins (RhoGAPs) have been identified as tumor suppressors in some human cancers. The present study aimed to explore ARHGAP17 expression in cervical cancer and the possible function in tumor progression. ARHGAP17 expression in cervical cancer cell lines was assessed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. ARHGAP17 expression in cervical cancer tissues and normal tissues was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The cell proliferation was determined using CCK-8 in vitro and subcutaneous xenograft model in vivo. Here, we showed lower expression of ARHGAP17 in cell lines and human cervical cancer samples. Manipulation of ARHGAP17 affected cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of AKT was enhanced in ARHGAP17 silencing cervical cancer cells. ARHGAP17 can elevate P21 and P27 expression level through inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Stepwise investigations demonstrated that ARHGAP17 suppressed malignant phenotype of cervical cancer cells via inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

Whereas somatic late effects have been assessed in many studies, less is known about the impact of childhood cancer on socioeconomic outcomes in survivors. The aim of this article was to evaluate and summarise the evidence on the socioeconomic conditions of childhood cancer survivors and to identify survivors at particular risk of adverse socioeconomic outcomes. An extensive literature search of three electronic databases was conducted. Of 419 articles identified, 52 met the inclusion criteria. All the selected articles were appraised for quality, and findings were summarised in a narrative synthesis. Childhood cancer survivors were at higher risk of adverse socioeconomic outcomes with regard to educational achievement, income and social security benefits than the general population or a sibling comparison group. The risks for unemployment and a lower occupational position were significantly increased only for survivors of a central nervous system tumour. Notably, survivors of central nervous system tumours, survivors treated with cranial radiotherapy and those diagnosed at younger age independent of cancer type were determinants of particular adverse socioeconomic outcomes.

The Potential Renal Acid Load (PRAL) score was used to estimate diet-dependent acid load. Higher scores reflect greater consumption of protein and phosphorus, and lower consumption of potassium, calcium and magnesium. The association between PRAL and breast cancer was evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. We identified 1,614 invasive breast cancers diagnosed at least 1 year after enrollment (mean follow-up, 7.6 years). The highest PRAL quartile, reflecting greater acid-forming potential, was associated with increased risk of breast cancer (HR highest vs. lowest quartile : 1.21 [95% CI, 1.04–1.41], p trend = 0.04). The association was more pronounced for estrogen receptor (ER)-negative (HR highest vs. lowest quartile : 1.67 [95% CI, 1.07–2.61], p trend = 0.03) and triple-negative breast cancer (HR highest vs. lowest quartile : 2.20 [95% CI, 1.23–3.95], p trend = 0.02). Negative PRAL scores, representing consumption of alkaline diets, were associated with decreased risk of ER-negative and triple-negative breast cancer, compared to a PRAL score of 0 representing neutral pH. Higher diet-dependent acid load may be a risk factor for breast cancer while alkaline diets may be protective. Since PRAL scores are positively correlated with meat consumption and negatively correlated with fruit and vegetable intake, results also suggest that diets high in fruits and vegetables and low in meat may be protective against hormone receptor negative breast cancer. © 2018 UICC","breast cancer; diet-dependent acid load; ER-negative breast cancer; potential renal acid load; triple-negative breast cancer",Article,Scopus

We investigated the effect of factorial randomisation to a 6-month lycopene and green tea dietary advice or supplementation intervention on 159 serum metabolite measures in 128 men with raised PSA levels (but prostate cancer-free), analysed by intention-to-treat. The causal effects of metabolites modified by the intervention on prostate cancer risk were then assessed by Mendelian randomisation, using summary statistics from 44,825 prostate cancer cases and 27,904 controls. The systemic effects of lycopene and green tea supplementation on serum metabolic profile were comparable to the effects of the respective dietary advice interventions (R 2 = 0.65 and 0.76 for lycopene and green tea respectively). Metabolites which were altered in response to lycopene supplementation were acetate [β (standard deviation difference vs. placebo): 0.69; 95% CI = 0.24, 1.15; p = 0.003], valine (β: −0.62; −1.03, −0.02; p = 0.004), pyruvate (β: −0.56; −0.95, −0.16; p = 0.006) and docosahexaenoic acid (β: −0.50; −085, −0.14; p = 0.006). Valine and diacylglycerol were lower in the lycopene dietary advice group (β: −0.65; −1.04, −0.26; p = 0.001 and β: −0.59; −1.01, −0.18; p = 0.006). A genetically instrumented SD increase in pyruvate increased the odds of prostate cancer by 1.29 (1.03, 1.62; p = 0.027).

Although fruits and vegetables are abundant in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory constituents, the reported associations between fruit and vegetable intake and pancreatic cancer risk have been inconsistent. Here, we investigated the association between fruit and vegetable intake and pancreatic cancer risk as part of the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. The analysis included 90,185 participants who responded to a medical and lifestyle questionnaire during 1995–1998. Associations between fruit and vegetable intake and pancreatic cancer risk were evaluated with Cox proportional hazards models. Additional analyses were stratified by smoking status and body mass index. During follow-up (median duration, 16.9 years), 577 participants were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In multivariate-adjusted models, pancreatic cancer risk was inversely associated with total fruit intake (highest vs. lowest intake quartile; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57–0.95, p-trend: 0.116) and positively associated with total vegetable intake (HR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.01–1.66, p-trend: 0.151).

For total vegetable intake, the positive association was statistically significant in ever smokers (HR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.01–2.19, p-trend: 0.043) and statistically nonsignificant in never smokers. In summary, total fruit intake and total vegetable intake had inverse and positive associations, respectively, with pancreatic cancer risk.

In this work, a sandwich-type cytosensor was structured to analyze cancer cells based on metal organic framework PCN-224 and DNA tetrahedron linked dual-aptamer. Firstly, the tetrahedral DNA nanostructures linked dual aptamers (AS1411 and MUC1) immobilizing on the gold electrode (GE) surface as bio-recognition elements can capture the MCF-7 cancer cells and improve the density and orientation of surface nanoprobes. Then, the novel metal organic framework PCN-224 homogeneously decorated by Pt nanoparticles was modified by the G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and dual-aptamer. The fabricated nanoprobes were applied to catalyze the oxidation of hydroquinone (HQ) with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) for amplifying the electrochemical signal. The results indicated that the linear response of the aptasensor ranged from 20 to 1 × 10 7 cells/mL and the detection limit was 6 cells/mL. Finally, we performed an electrochemical reductive desorption to break gold–thiol bond and release all compounds on the electrode surface for analyzing the viability of collected cells and regenerating the cytosensor.

In silico analyses and animal models suggest that terbinafine might have an anti-tumor effect. We aimed to explore whether subsequent administration of terbinafine might be associated with a lower mortality rate in patients with prostate cancer. We identified patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between July 2005 and December 2014 from the Swedish Cancer Registry, and linked them to the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register to ascertain subsequent use of terbinafine. A total of 799 patients received oral treatment of terbinafine during the study period with a mortality rate of 18.6 per 1,000 person-years. Compared to patients who did not use terbinafine and adjusting for a range of confounding factors, patients that received oral treatment of terbinafine had a decreased risk of death from prostate cancer (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38–0.73) and a decreased risk of death overall (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52–0.77). To account for indication bias, we further identified 907 patients who received topical use of terbinafine. However, the risk of death from prostate cancer in patients with topical use of terbinafine was 0.92 (95% CI 0.74–1.12) and the risk of death overall was 1.03 (95% CI 0.91–1.17) as compared to the controls, which suggests that there was no association between risk of death in patients with prostate cancer with topical use of terbinafine.

In this study, we showed that SGA suppressed tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. SGA also potentiated cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in lung cancer cells. TGFβ signaling and overexpression of Slug are regarded as the critical events in lung tumor malignancy. Functional studies revealed that SGA inhibited the TGFβ/FAK/AKT axis by inducing lipid-raft-mediated lysosome-dependent TGFβ receptor degradation, resulting in suppressing cancer cell viability and migration. Moreover, SGA elimination of TGFβ-mediated intracellular signaling promoted Slug degradation in H1975 cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that proteasome-dependent Slug degradation was controlled by TGFβ-mediated downstream signaling pathways; however, inhibitors of AKT and GSK3 abolished Slug degradation. Our findings suggested that SGA targets of the TGFβ/AKT/GSK3β axis played a key role in enhancing Slug degradation and suppressing lung cancer cells.

Adjusting parameters to make the membrane stiffer, as is the case with breast cancer cells compared with red blood cells, allows the model to produce reasonable estimates of breast cancer cell trajectories through the channel. In addition, the model produces estimates of quantities not as easily obtained from experiment such as velocity and stress field information throughout the fluid and on the cell membrane. This includes locations of maximum stress along the membrane wall. A sensitivity analysis shows that the model is capable of producing useful insights into various systems involving breast cancer cells. Current results suggest that dynamics taking place when cells are near other objects are most sensitive to membrane and cytoplasm elasticity, dynamics taking place when cells are not near other objects are most sensitive to cytoplasm viscosity, and dynamics are significantly affected by low membrane bending elasticity.

TMAs offer a valuable source of well-characterized biological material. However, because of the small tissue sample size method development was essential to provide the sensitivity and reliability necessary for the analysis. Surface digestion of TMA cores was followed by peptide extraction and shotgun proteomics analysis. About 5 times better sensitivity was achieved by the optimized surface digestion compared to bulk digestion of the same TMA spot and it allowed the identification of over 500 proteins from individual prostate TMA cores. Label-free quantitation showed that biological variability among all samples was about 3 times larger than the technical reproducibility. We have identified 189 proteins which showed statistically significant changes (t-test p-value <.05) in abundance between healthy and cancerous tissue samples. The proteomic profile changed according to cancer grade, but did not show a correlation with cancer stage. Results of this pilot study were further evaluated using bioinformatics tools, identifying various protein pathways affected by prostate cancer progression indicating the usefulness of studying TMA cores to identify quantitative changes in tissue proteomics. Significance: Detailed proteomics analysis of TMAs presents a good alternative for tissue analysis. Here we present a novel method, based on tissue surface digestion and nano-LC-MS measurements, which is capable of identifying and quantifying over 500 proteins from a 1.5 mm diameter tissue section. We compared healthy and cancerous prostate tissue samples, and tissues with various grades and stages of cancer. Tissue proteomics clearly distinguished healthy and cancerous samples, furthermore the results correlated well with cancer grade, but not with cancer stage. Over 100 proteins showed statistically significant abundance changes (t-test p-value <.05) between various groups. This was sufficient for a meaningful bioinformatics evaluation; showing e.g. increased abundance of proteins in cancer in the KEGG ribosome pathway, GO mRNA splicing via spliceosome, and chromatin assembly biological processes. The results highlight the feasibility of the developed method for future large-scale tissue proteomics studies using commercially available TMAs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Label-free quantitation; Mass spectrometry; Prostate cancer; Proteomics; Surface digestion; Tissue microarray",Article,Scopus

In particular, the as-prepared PPT-PRA conjugate can self-assemble into vesicle in water, furthermore, another anti-cancer drug (doxorubicin was chosen as an example) can be loaded in the vesicle for synergistic drug delivery. For better cancer cells targeting, the vesicle was then modified with folic acid (FA).

It combines a specific grating structure photo-imprinted in a telecommunication-grade optical fiber and an overlay made of a thin metal coating on which receptors are grafted, yielding plasmonic coupling. Our optrode targets a type of cytokeratins, overexpressed at the surface of cancer cells. It was assayed ex vivo in resected lung tissues collected from a dozen of patients. Biosensing responses were confirmed by immunohistochemistry, conducted on the same samples. In addition to accurate biosensing, our gratings inherently enable force-sensing features, which also allow a fine positioning of the probe in the tissue. Finally, the in vivo navigation of the bronchoscope-embedded sensor was validated into pig lungs.

Our results show that all compounds have high activity towards cancer cells with low IC 50 values in the micromolar range. We observed that all Ru-PMC compounds are mainly found inside the cells, in contrast with the parental low molecular weight compound Ru1 that was mainly found at the membrane. All compounds induced mitochondrial alterations. PMC3 and Ru1 caused F-actin cytoskeleton morphology changes and reduced the clonogenic ability of the cells. The conjugate PMC3 induced apoptosis at low concentrations comparing to cisplatin and could overcame the platinum resistance of A2780cis cancer cells.

Our study provides a first prospective evaluation of an ApoA2 isoform (“ApoA2-ATQ/AT”), alone and in combination with carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19-9), as an early detection biomarker for pancreatic cancer. We performed ELISA measurements of CA19-9 and ApoA2-ATQ/AT in 156 patients with pancreatic cancer and 217 matched controls within the European EPIC cohort, using plasma samples collected up to 60 months prior to diagnosis. The detection discrimination statistics were calculated for risk scores by strata of lag-time. For CA19-9, in univariate marker analyses, C-statistics to distinguish future pancreatic cancer patients from cancer-free individuals were 0.80 for plasma taken ≤6 months before diagnosis, and 0.71 for >6–18 months; for ApoA2-ATQ/AT, C-statistics were 0.62, and 0.65, respectively. Joint models based on ApoA2-ATQ/AT plus CA19-9 significantly improved discrimination within >6–18 months (C = 0.74 vs. 0.71 for CA19-9 alone, p = 0.022) and ≤ 18 months (C = 0.75 vs. 0.74, p = 0.022). At 98% specificity, and for lag times of ≤6, >6–18 or ≤ 18 months, sensitivities were 57%, 36% and 43% for CA19-9 combined with ApoA2-ATQ/AT, respectively, vs. 50%, 29% and 36% for CA19-9 alone. Compared to CA19-9 alone, the combination of CA19-9 and ApoA2-ATQ/AT may improve detection of pancreatic cancer up to 18 months prior to diagnosis under usual care, and may provide a useful first measure for pancreatic cancer detection prior to imaging. © 2018 UICC","apolipoprotein A2; CA19-9; early detection; isoforms; pancreatic cancer; prospective study",Article,Scopus

The correct diagnosis of this lesion leads to the indication of the most adequate treatments for cancer-affected patients. The diagnosis is made through the visual analysis of tissue samples by pathologists. However, this analysis is susceptible to intra- and inter-pathologists variability in addition to being a complex and time-consuming task. To deal with these challenges, image processing methods are developed for application on histological images obtained through the digitization of the tissue samples. To do so, feature extraction and classification techniques are investigated to aid pathologists and make it possible a faster and more objective diagnosis definition. Therefore, in this work, we propose a method that associates multidimensional fractal techniques, curvelet transforms and Haralick descriptors for the study and pattern recognition of colorectal cancer, which not yet explored in the Literature. The proposed method considered a feature selection approach and different classification techniques for evaluating associations, such as decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, naive Bayes, k* and a polynomial method. This strategy allowed for more precise interpretations regarding the best associations for the separation of groups concerning histological images of colorectal cancer. The proposal was tested on colorectal images from two distinct datasets commonly investigated in the Literature. The best result was reached with features based mainly on lacunarity and percolation obtained from curvelet sub-images, using a polynomial classifier. The tests were evaluated by applying the 10-fold cross-validation method and the result was 0.994 of AUC, which is a relevant contribution to the Literature of pattern recognition of colorectal cancer. The obtained performance with a detailed analysis involving different types of features and classifiers are important contributions for pathologists, specialists interested in the study of this cancer and histological image processing researchers, which aim to develop the clinically applicable computational techniques. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Colorectal cancer; Curvelet transforms; Feature associations; Fractal techniques; Haralick descriptors; Multiresolution features",Article,Scopus

In particular, our approach is centered on the Palm intensity function. This leads to taking an approximate-likelihood technique in fitting point processes models. We consider two Neyman-Scott point processes and a void process, fitting these point process models to the CRC patient data. We find that the parameter estimates of these models may be used to quantify the spatial arrangement of cells.

Here we developed a non-invasive, SDA-based DLS method for the diagnosis of bladder cancer by detecting telomerase activity in human urine. In the presence of telomerase, the telomerase substrate (TS) primer was elongated with repeating sequences of (TTAGGG)n, and the resulting product triggers SDA between the hairpin deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and the Primer. The SDA product can be recognized by the oligonucleotide-modified AuNPs probes, resulting in DLS measurable AuNPs aggregation. The assay displayed a detection limit of 3 MCF-7 cells with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 in a dynamic range of 5–1000 cells. The method was simple, reliable and has been successfully applied in the detection of telomerase in urine with good accuracy, selectivity and reproducibility. Moreover, only urine samples from bladder cancer patients induced a significant change in the average hydrodynamic diameter, indicating practical applicability of the method for the non-invasive diagnosis of bladder cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bladder cancer; Detection; Dynamic light scattering; Gold nanoparticles; Strand displacement amplification; Telomerase activity",Article,Scopus

We demonstrate that ERBB2 heterodimerizes with EGFR to constitutively activate the ErbB signaling pathway in gallbladder cells. Consistent with this, treatment with ERBB2-specific, EGFR-specific shRNA or with a covalent EGFR family inhibitor Afatinib inhibits tumor-associated characteristics of the gallbladder cancer cells. Furthermore, we observe an in vivo reduction in tumor size of gallbladder xenografts in response to Afatinib is paralleled by a reduction in the amounts of phospho-ERK, in tumors harboring KRAS (G13D) mutation but not in KRAS (G12V) mutation, supporting an essential role of the ErbB pathway.

However, the role of PAICS in human lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) requires further study. Methods: In this research, the effects of PAICS on the occurrence and prognosis of LADC were evaluated using integrative bioinformatics analyses. Results: By employing the bioinformatics analyses of several public databases, PAICS, which is overexpressed in the LADC tissues, was identified as a potential tumor-promoting gene in LADC biology. Several relevant clinical studies indicated that the upregulation of PAICS was statistically correlated with a shorter overall survival time. Moreover, the carcinogenic function of PAICS in LADC was validated by the further protein-protein interactions (PPI) and biological process annotation analysis. Mechanistically, we found that the PAICS methylation level was significantly lower in the LADC tissues compared to the normal lung tissues. Furthermore, using the MEXPRESS web tool, we predicted 15 possible DNA methylation sites in the nucleotide sequences of PAICS, which could explain the alteration in the PAICS expression levels in LADC. Conclusions: Our work demonstrates that high levels of PAICS are found in LADC and that this gene may be a potential therapeutic target for this subset of lung cancers. Determining the detailed roles of PAICS in LADC biology may provide useful information for further investigations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Lung adenocarcinoma; Methylation; PAICS; Therapeutic target",Article,Scopus

Here, we describe a simple and cost-effective plasmonic paper as a surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate in combination with magnetic separation for cancer screening. The plasmonic paper was fabricated by immersing plain filter paper into gold nanorod solution and the SERS property of the paper was evaluated using 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) and rhodamine 6 G (R6 G), which showed an enhancement factor (EF) in the range of 10 6 –10 8 . HT-29, a colorectal cancer cell line that highly expresses epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), served as the target cells; non-EpCAM-expressing cells, namely fibroblasts and red blood cells (RBCs), were used as negative controls. Intrinsic SERS spectra of the target and control cells showed distinctive patterns on the plasmonic paper due to differences in their structure and components. A combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and k-nearest-neighbor algorithm (k-NN) was employed to analyze and distinguish the acquired HT-29 and fibroblast SERS spectra, demonstrating a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 84.8% and 82.6%, respectively, whereas the differentiation between HT-29 and RBCs SERS spectra showed a sensitivity and specificity of 96.4% and 100%, respectively. The magnetic separation was applied to capture the target cells from cell mixtures followed by PCA and k-NN analysis. The identification of the captured cells as cancerous cells from the HT-29 and fibroblast mixture indicated an accuracy of 83.7%, while that from a mixture of HT-29 and RBCs was 98.2%. Thus, the simple paper-based SERS substrate with the assistance of magnetic enrichment and multivariate analysis offers a potent new platform for cancer cell detection and screening. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cancer screening; Gold nanorod; Magnetic separation; Plasmonic paper; Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)",Article,Scopus

Therefore, we screened antibodies against BAP31 from a human VH single-domain antibody library and expressed the antibodies intracellularly. It was found that one of the intrabodies (VH-D1) specifically inhibited p27 kip1 proteasome degradation, possibly by blocking the combination of BAP31 with p27 kip1 . VH-D1 displayed therapeutic effects, as it was able to reduce the growth of human gastric cancer (GC) cell xenografts in nude mice. This effect was due to inhibition of the proliferation and subsequent activation of caspase-dependent apoptosis.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted from September 2014 to June 2017. A total of 21 HCCs in 21 patients with cirrhosis were treated with IRE. There were eight subcapsular or exophytic, ten perivascular and three peribiliary tumors. The median tumor size was 26 mm (range 14–40 mm). The technical success of the procedure was recorded. Median follow-up, median time to local recurrence, median local tumor progression-free survival (PFS) and complications were recorded. Results: Technical success was achieved in all the patients. The median follow-up was 10 months (range 2–30 months). The median time to local recurrence and local tumor PFS were 4 months (range 3–4 months) and 7 months (range 3–30 months), respectively. The tumor-related factor that was significantly associated with local PFS was the size. Maximum tumor diameter < 25 mm was significantly associated with local tumor PFS (p = 0.045). Other parameters including tumor location, segmental portal vein thrombosis, baseline alpha-fetoprotein level and underlying etiology did not affect local tumor PFS. Complications were noted in nine patients and were classified as grades 1 and 2. No procedure-related mortality was encountered. Conclusion: IRE is an effective treatment for ablation of small HCCs. Larger prospective studies with strict selection criteria will establish the safety and efficacy of IRE in the treatment of unresectable HCC in patients who cannot undergo thermal ablation. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE).","Hepatocellular carcinoma; Irreversible electroporation; Radiofrequency ablation",Article,Scopus

Xenograft model exhibited that Rk1 significantly repressed tumor growth with low toxicity to major organs. Moreover, Rk1 dramatically inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, promoted LDH release, and induced G 0 /G 1 phase arrest.

Herein, CASC2 and SPRY2 expression was down-regulated in PC tissues and cell lines; the overexpression of CASC2 and SPRY2 could suppress PC cell proliferation, promote PC cell apoptosis, and enhance the sensitivity of PC cells to docetaxel.

However, it remains unclear whether IFITM1 is functionally indispensable in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, using NSCLC cell lines and patient-derived samples, we show that IFITM1 is essentially required for the progression of NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, IFITM1 depletion resulted in a significant reduction in sphere formation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells in vitro; these events were inversely correlated with the ectopic expression of IFITM1. In addition, tumor development was significantly impaired in the absence of IFITM1 in vivo. Mechanistically, epidermal growth factor receptor/sex-determining region Y-box 2 (EGFR/SOX2) signaling axis was compromised in the absence of IFITM1, and the ectopic expression of SOX2 partially rescued the defects caused by IFITM1 depletion. More importantly, using 226 patient-derived samples, we demonstrate that a high level of IFITM1 expression is associated with a poor overall survival (OS) rate in adenocarcinoma but not in squamous cell carcinoma.

Caspases; the key executors of apoptotic cascade are attractive targets for selective induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. Within this approach, various caspase activators were introduced as lead anticancer agents. In the current study, a new series of multifunctional Passerini products was synthesized and evaluated as potent caspase-dependent apoptotic inducers. The synthetic strategy adopted this isocyanide-based multicomponent reaction to possibly mimic the pharmacophoric features of various lead apoptotic inducers, where a series of α-acyloxy carboxamides was prepared from p-nitrophenyl isonitrile, cyclohexanone and various carboxylic acids. Accordingly, the main amide-based scaffold was decorated by substituents with varying nature and size to gain more information about structure-activity relationship. All the synthesized compounds were screened for cytotoxicity against normal human fibroblasts and their potential anticancer activities against three human cancer cell lines; MCF-7 (breast), NFS-60 (myeloid leukemia), and HepG-2 (liver) utilizing MTT assay. Among the most active compounds, 13, 21 and 22 were more potent and safer than doxorubicin with nanomolar IC 50 values and promising selectivity indices. Mechanistically, 13, 21 and 22 induced apoptosis by significant caspase activation in all the screened cancer cell lines utilizing flow cytometric analysis and caspase 3/7 activation assay. Again, 13 and 21 recorded higher activation percentages than doxorubicin, while 22 showed comparable results. Apoptosis-inducing factor1 (AIF1) quantification assay declared that 13, 21 and 22 didn't mediate apoptosis through AIF1-dependent pathway (i.e. only by caspase activation). Physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetic profiles, ligand efficiency metrics and drug-likeness data of all the synthesized compounds were computationally predicted and showed that 13, 21 and 22 could be considered as drug-like candidates. Finally, selected compounds were preliminarily screened for possible antimicrobial activities searching for dual anticancer/antimicrobial agents as an advantageous approach for cancer therapy. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","Anticancer; Apoptotic inducer; Caspase 3/7 activator; Passerini",Article,Scopus

This process also is involved in cancer progression and prognosis. The potential of APA events as novel prognostic biomarkers has been suggested. CCND2 gene, which is overexpressed in various cancer tissues, tends to utilize the proximal APA site and produces a more prominent mRNA isoform with shorter 3’ untranslated region in the cancer cells. In this study, an ultrasensitive detection for CCND2 APA was successfully achieved using electrochemical biosensors constructed by gold nanoparticles-Fe 3 O 4 nanocomposite and p-sulfonated calix[8]arene functionalized reduced graphene oxide as nanocarriers. The detection ranges of CCND2-S and CCND2-L by the constructed biosensors were 10 −18 –10 −11 and 10 −17 –10 −11 M, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) of CCND2-S was 0.176 aM (the RNA concentration at the single-cell level). To the best of our knowledge, this value was the lowest LOD among the reported non-coding RNA detection. In real samples, the results of the electrochemical detection using the constructed biosensors showed that the lung cancer cell H292 expressed considerably higher CCND2-S than CCND2-L. This result was in agreement with those obtained by RT-qPCR method. The electrochemical method had showed simpler operation, accurate quantitation, faster detection, and cheaper supplies compared with traditional methods. Therefore, this technology not only provides an ultrasensitive and feasible method for APA detection, but can also be applied in the prognosis and diagnosis of cancer progression. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation; Calix[8]arene; Electrochemical biosensor; Gold nanoparticles-Fe 3 O 4; Non-coding RNA; Single-cell level",Article,Scopus

An integrated method involving molecular toxicology and mass spectrometry (MS)-based global metabolomics was applied to evaluate the toxicity of TCBPA and TBBPA on cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and metabolic alterations. The results demonstrated that low micromolar levels (0–10 μM) of TCBPA/TBBPA exposure induced cell proliferation and activated the energy metabolism of both glycolysis and amino acid. On the other hand, high micromolar levels (10–50 μM) of TCBPA/TBBPA exposure perturbed the balance between ROS and antioxidative defense process by promoting the ROS generation via the down-regulation of glutathione biosynthesis and up-regulation of nucleotide metabolism.

The GWAS dataset from Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial was used as the discovery, and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression with false-positive report probability for multiple test corrections were performed to evaluate associations between 14,699 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 111 genes and survival of 1,185 NSCLC patients. The identified significant SNPs in a single-locus analysis were further validated with 984 NSCLC patients in the GWAS dataset from the Harvard Lung Cancer Susceptibility (HLCS) Study. The results showed that two independent, potentially functional SNPs in two genes (VWF rs73049469 and ITGB2 rs3788142) were significantly associated with NSCLC survival, with a combined hazards ratio (HR) of 1.22 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07–1.40, P = 0.002] and 1.16 (1.07–1.27, 6.45 × 10 −4 ), respectively. Finally, we performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis and found that survival-associated genotypes of VWF rs73049469 were also significantly associated with mRNA expression levels of the gene.

Metabolic profiles of 15 SPs, including nine dipeptides and six tripeptides were acquired from plasma samples of 140 EOC and 158 benign ovarian tumor (BOT) patients. Partial least square discriminant analysis showed separations between EOC and BOT subjects of different age brackets. Hyp-Leu, Glu-Trp and Phe-Phe were selected as promising predictive SP-biomarkers for better EOC diagnosis compared to conventional biomarkers. Combined Hyp-Leu, Glu-Trp and CA125 presented an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.904, with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.804 and 0.944, respectively. This finding suggested that the combination of these biomarkers performed much better than CA125 alone. Hyp-Leu and Gly-Phe-Trp showed significantly improved performances in the log-rank tests and Kaplan–Meier curves demonstrating their prognostic potential. All SP-biomarkers proved to have excellent stabilities at room temperature. Correlation network analysis implied latent conversions among amino acids, dipeptides and tripeptides during EOC. In conclusion, the selected SPs in combination with CA125 show profound promise for discriminating EOCs from BOTs and for predicting the progression after surgery, which provides invaluable information for clinicians in the precision diagnosis and treatment of EOC. © 2018 UICC","biomarker; epithelial ovarian cancer; metabolic profiling analysis; small peptide",Article,Scopus

Yet, the development of acquired resistance, after prolonged treatments with AIs, represents a clinical major concern. Serendipitous findings indicate that aromatase may be non-competitively inhibited by clinically employed drugs and/or industrial chemicals.

Most PCa cases develop eventually from an androgen-dependent stage to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with AR-signaling still being active. Thus, inhibition of AR remains a well-established promising drug target in CRPC. However, despite the improvements of current treatment for CRPC by targeting the AR, the evolution of adaptive AR-signaling leads to therapy-resistant CRPC. Treatment failure is based mostly on the inability to keep AR under long-term restraint due to adaptive responses of AR-signaling. One underlying mechanism appears to be the increased AR protein stability. Therefore, the regulation of AR protein stability and its degradation is another interesting path that could enhance our knowledge of carcinogenesis and tumor evolution possibly leading to novel therapeutic targets. In this review, we discuss various molecular mechanisms and factors that stabilize AR protein levels directly or indirectly. We summarize novel approaches to interfere with AR stability including targeting the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), heat shock proteins, and co-chaperones as well as E3-ligases using small chimeric molecules. These novel approaches in combination with antiandrogen treatment inhibit PCa growth through the regulation of AR protein levels. © 2018 UICC","androgen receptor; castration resistance; protein stability; receptor degradation; therapy resistance",Review,Scopus

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was utilized to analyze metabolites in both the in vivo and in vitro experimental groups. In vivo, VOCs were analyzed in the blood of mice after cell inoculation and tumor resection. In vitro experiments were performed by comparing changes in VOCs in an HCoEpiC cell group, control group, SW620 cell group and Arsenic trioxide + SW620 group. We observed changes in VOCs in a series of CRC SW620 cells in vivo and in vitro. Among these changes, we found that the concentrations of 8 substances, including acetone, increased with tumor growth. Nine substances were found to be significantly elevated in the SW620 cancer cell group compared with the other groups.

The goal of this study is to identify the non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) which may affect the expression levels of ABCA3; the previously identified prognostic biomarker for multidrug resistance (MDR) in childhood ALL (cALL). Bone marrow samples from 64 cALLs, including 46 de novo and 18 relapsed patients, in addition to 30 non-cancer controls were collected, and ncRNAs were nominated using in silico studies. Quantitative RT-PCR showed low expression profiles of miR-335-3p in cALLs compared with the control group (P = 0.018). Inverse correlation was determined between the miR-335-3p and ABCA3 mRNA expression profiles in cALL patients (r = 0.5019, P = 0.002). Moreover, it was shown that the expression levels of miR-335-3p was downregulated in the drug-resistant samples (MDR group) compared with the drug-sensitive patients (mrd− group), (P = 0.0005, AUC = 0.801). On the other hand, negative correlations were identified between the expression levels of miR-335-3p and the selected LncRNAs, NEAT1 and MALAT1, in the MDR group compared with the mrd− patients (P = 0.009), suggesting a sponge effect for these LncRNAs. The current study showed a potential regulatory role for miR-335-3p in ABCA3 expression targeted by NEAT1 and MALAT1 long non-coding RNAs. This negative impact may possibly contribute to the development of chemoresistance in childhood ALL, and provide an exceptional insight to new therapeutic approaches. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","ABC transporter; ABCA3; Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia; Long non-coding RNA; MALAT1; miR-335-3p; Multidrug resistance; NEAT1",Article,Scopus

Upregulation of ST3Gal1 has been associated with worse prognosis of breast cancer patients. However, the protein substrates of ST3Gal1 implicated in tumor progression remain elusive. In our study, we demonstrated that ST3GAL1-silencing significantly reduced tumor growth along with a notable decrease in vascularity of MCF7 xenograft tumors. We identified vasorin (VASN) which was shown to bind TGF-β1, as a potential candidate that links ST3Gal1 to angiogenesis. LC-MS/MS analysis of VASN secreted from MCF7, revealed that more than 80% of its O-glycans are sialyl-3T and disialyl-T. ST3GAL1-silencing or desialylation of VASN by neuraminidase enhanced its binding to TGF-β1 by 2- to 3-fold and thereby dampening TGF-β1 signaling and angiogenesis, as indicated by impaired tube formation of HUVECs, suppressed angiogenesis gene expression and reduced activation of Smad2 and Smad3 in HUVEC cells. Examination of 114 fresh primary breast cancer and their adjacent normal tissues showed that the expression levels of ST3Gal1 and TGFB1 were high in tumor part and the expression of two genes was positively correlated. Kaplan Meier survival analysis showed a significantly shorter relapse-free survival for those with lower expression VASN, notably, the combination of low VASN with high ST3GAL1 yielded even higher risk of recurrence (p = 0.025, HR = 2.967, 95% CI = 1.14–7.67). Since TGF-β1 is known to transcriptionally activate ST3Gal1, our findings illustrated a feedback regulatory loop in which TGF-β1 upregulates ST3Gal1 to circumvent the negative impact of VASN. © 2018 The Authors.

Because of cost-effectiveness, multigene panel testing is often performed even if the clinical utility of testing most of the genes remains questionable. The purpose of our study was to assess the contribution of rare, deleterious-predicted variants in DNA repair genes in familial breast cancer (BC) in a well-characterized and homogeneous population. We analyzed 113 DNA repair genes selected from either an exome sequencing or a candidate gene approach in the GENESIS study, which includes familial BC cases with no BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and having a sister with BC (N = 1,207), and general population controls (N = 1,199). Sequencing data were filtered for rare loss-of-function variants (LoF) and likely deleterious missense variants (MV). We confirmed associations between LoF and MV in PALB2, ATM and CHEK2 and BC occurrence. We also identified for the first time associations between FANCI, MAST1, POLH and RTEL1 and BC susceptibility. Unlike other associated genes, carriers of an ATM LoF had a significantly higher risk of developing BC than carriers of an ATM MV (OR LoF = 17.4 vs. OR MV = 1.6; p Het = 0.002). Hence, our approach allowed us to specify BC relative risks associated with deleterious-predicted variants in PALB2, ATM and CHEK2 and to add MAST1, POLH, RTEL1 and FANCI to the list of DNA repair genes possibly involved in BC susceptibility. We also highlight that different types of variants within the same gene can lead to different risk estimates. © 2018 The Authors.

The approaches relying on the use of a single chemosensitizer have never resulted in a clinical success. Therefore, the application of drug combinations of two or more compounds with different mechanisms of action might be an alternative approach to increase the success rate. In the present study the cytotoxic and NF-κB inhibition potential of the phenothiazine derivative, MAE-TPR, was evaluated. MAE-TPR was demonstrated to be an effective doxorubicin-resistance modulator in human adenocarcinoma cell line LoVo/Dx. In the presence of MAE-TPR cytotoxicity of doxorubicin was elevated, and its intracellular accumulation increased. Strong synergism occurred between MAE-TPR and Dox. MAE-TPR diminished also the expression of ABCB1 transporter (P-glycoprotein) by affecting NF-κB pathway. Theobromine, a phytochemical from cocoa, which was barely active itself, strongly augmented MDR reversal potency of MAE-TPR. The effect of the combination of phenothiazine derivative with theobromine on cancer cells was studied for the first time in the present work. It was concluded that the use of the proposed combination of two modulators might be a promising strategy for MDR reversal since modulators could be used in concentrations much lower than in case of their single application and in that way the risk of intolerable side-effects could be reduced. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein); Cancer multidrug resistance; NF-κB pathway; Phenothiazine derivative; Synergy; Theobromine",Article,Scopus

Doxazosin is also being evaluated as a treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcoholism, and α1-adrenergic blockers have been linked to neuroprotection in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Cancer and AD have an inverse relationship in many aspects, with several factors that contribute to apoptosis inhibition and proliferation being increased in cancers but decreased in AD. Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric tumor derived from embryonic neural-crest cells, with an overall cure rate of 40%, despite aggressive treatment. Thus, due to the need of new therapeutic strategies against NB and neurodegenerative disorders and the inverse relationship between these diseases, we investigated whether doxazosin may serve as an antitumor and neuroprotective agent. We analyzed the drug's effects on undifferentiated and retinoic acid-differentiated SH-SY5Y human NB cells and on an in vitro model of organotypic hippocampal cultures exposed to amyloid-β. Doxazosin showed antitumor effect on undifferentiated NB cells by induction of apoptosis, necrosis, cell cycle arrest and decrease of p-EGFR Tyr1048 levels. On differentiated cells, doxazosin was less cytotoxic and increased p-EGFR Tyr1048 , p-Akt Ser473 and p-GSK-3β Ser9 levels. Moreover, the drug was able to protect hippocampal slices from amyloid-β toxicity through prevention of GSK-3β activation and of Tau hyperphosphorylation. Therefore, our results show that doxazosin has antitumor activity against undifferentiated NB and is neuroprotective on an in vitro model of Alzheimer's disease. © 2019 IBRO","Alzheimer's disease; amyloid-β; doxazosin; EGFR; neuroblastoma; SH-SY5Y",Article,Scopus

In the present study, we genotyped the rs4073, rs2227306 and rs1126647 single nucleotide polymorphisms within IL-8 gene in 530 individuals including 130 PCa patients, 200 BPH patients and 200 male controls. The rs2227306 alleles and genotypes were distributed equally in the three study groups. The frequency of the A allele of the rs4073 was significantly lower in PCa group compared with BPH group (OR (95% CI) = 0.62 (0.46–0.84), adjusted P value = 0.006). This allele was negatively associated with PCa risk in dominant model (OR (95% CI) = 0.53 (0.34–0.83), adjusted P value = 0.02). When comparing PCa and BPH groups, the rs1126647 was associated with PCa risk in recessive model (OR (95% CI) = 2.14 (1.23–3.72), adjusted P value = 0.02). The A T A haplotype (rs4073, rs2227306 and rs1126647 respectively) was less frequent in PCa group compared with BPH group (OR (95% CI) = 0.4 (0.22–0.75), adjusted P value = 0.03). Consequently, our data demonstrated significant differences in allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies of IL-8 variants between BPH and PCa patients which might imply distinct role for this chemokine in the pathogenesis of these disorders.

Early life energy restriction may inhibit these mechanisms, resulting in shorter height and a reduced postmenopausal BC risk. Women (62,573) from the Netherlands Cohort Study completed a self-administered questionnaire in 1986 when 55–69 years old, and were followed-up for 20.3 years (case–cohort: N subcohort = 2,438; N cases = 3,354). Cox multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for BC risk overall and by estrogen and progesterone receptor subtypes in relation to height and early life energy restriction during the Hunger Winter, War Years, and Economic Depression. Although energy restriction can only influence longitudinal growth in women exposed before and/or during the growth spurt, it may also influence BC risk when occurring after the growth spurt, possibly through different growth processes. Therefore, Cox analyses were additionally conducted according to timing of energy restriction in relation to the growth spurt. Height was associated with an increased BC risk (HR per 5cm = 1.07, 95%CI:1.01–1.13), particularly hormone receptor-positive BC. Energy restriction before and/or during the growth spurt was associated with a decreased hormone receptor-positive BC risk. Energy restriction during the Hunger Winter increased the estrogen receptor-negative BC risk regardless of the timing of energy restriction. In conclusion, height and energy restriction before and/or during the growth spurt were both associated with hormone receptor-positive BC risk, in the direction as expected, indicating critical exposure windows for hormonal growth-related mechanisms. © 2018 UICC","adult-attained height; breast cancer epidemiology; energy restriction; estrogen receptor status; progesterone receptor status",Article,Scopus

In mammalian cells, nine genes encode a family of sequence-related enzymes; six of these PRMTs catalyze the formation of ω-asymmetric dimethyl derivatives, two catalyze ω-symmetric dimethyl derivatives, and only one (PRMT7) solely catalyzes ω-monomethylarginine formation. Purified recombinant PRMT7 displays a number of unique enzymatic properties including a substrate preference for arginine residues in R-X-R motifs with additional flanking basic amino acid residues and a temperature optimum well below 37 °C. Evidence has been presented for crosstalk between PRMT7 and PRMT5, where methylation of a histone H4 peptide at R17, a PRMT7 substrate, may activate PRMT5 for methylation of R3. Defects in muscle stem cells (satellite cells) and immune cells are found in mouse Prmt7 homozygous knockouts, while humans lacking PRMT7 are characterized by significant intellectual developmental delays, hypotonia, and facial dysmorphisms. The overexpression of the PRMT7 gene has been correlated with cancer metastasis in humans. Current research challenges include identifying cellular factors that control PRMT7 expression and activity, identifying the physiological substrates of PRMT7, and determining the effect of methylation on these substrates. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Cancer; Epigenetics; Monomethylarginine; Pluripotency; PRMT7; Protein arginine methylation",Review,Scopus

This peptide was synthetically produced with the disulfide bond restraining its conformation to mimic the reactive loop that inhibits trypsin. PTRY9 complexed to pancreatic bovine trypsin was crystallized in orthorhombic and trigonal space groups, P2 1 2 1 2 1 and P3 2 21, with maximum resolutions of 1.15 and 1.61 Å respectively.

Spectroscopic studies indicated that rifampicin binds to CT-DNA with a binding constant of ~5.22 × 10 5 M −1 . Several independent experiments like CD analysis, competitive displacement experiments and viscosity measurements revealed that rifampicin intercalates into the CT-DNA. Molecular docking studies corroborate this fact and depicted that this drug binds to the GC-rich region of DNA through multiple hydrogen bonding having the relative binding energy of −9.21 kcal mol −1 .

In this work, a simple dual-signal amplification strategy has been used to construct a novel nanosensor on single Au nanowire electrodes (SAuNWEs) for miRNA-16 detection based on the “signal-on” and “signal-off” features during hybridization/de-hybridization process. The ferrocene-labeled aptamer capture probe (Fc-CP-16) is designed to hybridize with thiolated methylene blue-labeled DNA probe (MB-CP) on SAuNWE to form duplex DNA, and the addition of miRNA-16 can lead to the dissociation of duplex structure due to the highly matched sequences between miRNA-16 and Fc-CP-16. The remaining MB-CP can thus tend to recover its hairpin structure at the presence of Mg 2+ through the hybridization of its complementary sequences. During this hybridization/de-hybridization process, the changes of Fc and MB oxidation peaks can be recorded, and there has a linear relationship between the sum of dual-signal changes (ΔI=ΔI MB +|ΔI Fc |) and the logarithm of miRNA-16 concentrations, which can be used to detect miRNA-16. Including miRNA extraction, the dual-signal amplification strategy for miRNA sensing assay was carried out about 2 h for the detection in real samples.

The values of molar conductance of the complexes in DMSO solution at 10 −3 M concentration indicate their non-electrolyte nature. IR spectroscopy has revealed the coordination of deprotonated ligands to metal through nitrogen and oxygen atoms in an N 2 O 2 arrangement. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the hybrid functional of Truhlar and Zhao (M06) with basis set of double zeta quality LANL2DZ to evaluate the cis and trans coordination modes and to ascertain dipole moment, HOMO-LUMO energy gap, chemical hardness, softness and electrophilicity. The magnetic moments and ESR measurements suggest that there is an admixture of S = 5/2 and S = 1/2 spins in Fe(III) complexes. UV–Visible spectra indicate a distorted octahedral geometry around the metal ions. Thermal analyses show the presence of hydrated and coordinated water. The antimicrobial activity was investigated against (G + and G − ) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and fungi (Candida albicans). The iron and zinc complexes were found to be more active against Gram-positive than Gram negative bacteria. They also show considerable growth inhibition against the fungi tested.

The objective of this study was to use fermented food wastes as major sources of protein to replace the fish meal used in fish feeds for culturing jade perch (Scortum barcoo) and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Two experiments (a laboratory and a field trial) were conducted to test the suitability of the fish feeds for the two fish species. In the laboratory trial, six out of seven formulations (six food waste-based formulations and one commercial diet as control) were tested on jade perch whereas four out of the seven formulations were tested on Nile tilapia to study the effects of the diets on the growth performance and serum immunological parameters of fish. The formulations (Diet F and Diet A) with the best growth performance (feed conversion ratio (FCR) of jade perch (1.98) and Nile tilapia (1.28)) while having the lowest amount of fish meal (5%) were selected for field scale feeding trial. In addition, the percentage of fermented food waste ingredient in fish feed (Diet A and Diet F) was about 50% without causing significant effects on the immunity (P &lt; 0.05) of the two fish species when compared with control diet. In the field scale feeding trial, FCR values of jade perch and Nile tilapia fed with Diet F and A were 1.06 and 1.16, respectively, which were similar to the control diet (P &gt; 0.05). Metal/loids concentrations in fish tissue showed that both fish species fed with food waste-based pellets (Nile tilapia) Diet A: As (0.028 mg/kg), Cd (0.011 mg/kg), Cr (0.163 mg/kg), Cu (0.851 mg/kg), Hg (0.141 mg/kg), Pb (0.081 mg/kg) and Zn (30.8 mg/kg)) and jade perch Diet F: As (0.709 mg/kg), Cd (0.026 mg/kg), Cr (0.300 mg/kg), Cu (2.49 mg/kg), Hg (0.318 mg/kg), Pb (1.745 mg/kg) and Zn (40.9 mg/kg) were all below the maximum permissible levels of the local standard (As (AS 2 O 3 ) = 6 mg/kg; Cd = 2 mg/kg; Cr = 1 mg/kg; Pb = 6 mg/kg; Hg = 0.5 mg/kg), while no permissible levels of Cu and Pb are stipulated by the standard.

Optimizing the effectiveness of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in this population is imperative, and microvalve infusion catheters offer a means of such improvement. Methods: All treatment-naive patients with solitary HCC tumors < 6.5 cm who underwent drug-eluting microspheres (DEM) TACE between 04/2015 and 08/2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Eighty-eight included patients underwent DEM-TACE with either standard end-hole catheters (EH) or microvalve infusion catheters (MVI). The EH (n = 70) and MVI (n = 18) cohorts had similar baseline tumor size, laboratory values, and tumor etiologies. Results: Initial objective response rates were significantly higher in MVI vs. EH (100% vs. 76.5%, p = 0.019). There was no difference in adverse events between groups (p = 0.265). MVI patients exhibited lower AST (p = 0.003) and ALT (p = 0.044) at 6 months. Blinded pathological analysis of explanted livers showed greater concentrations of microspheres within the tumor relative to the surrounding tissue in MVI explants (88.7 ± 10.6%) versus the EH explants (55.3 ± 32.7%) (p = 0.002). There was significantly higher percentage tumor necrosis in the MVI group (89.0 ± 2.2%) compared with the EH group (56.1 ± 44.5%) (p = 0.006). Conclusion: In this retrospective study of a single-center cohort, DEM-TACE procedures with MVI were associated with improved tumor response, increased deposition of microspheres within tumor tissue, and higher percentage tumor necrosis at explant relative to those performed using EH catheters. © 2019, The Author(s).","Anti-reflux catheter; Hepatocellular tumor pathology; Liver explant; Liver transplantation; Locoregional therapy",Review,Scopus

Methods: A single-institution retrospective review was performed of 160 patients with NET liver metastases initially treated with TAE using < 100 µm (n = 77) or only ≥ 100 µm (n = 83) spherical particles. For each patient, we evaluated: initial response by mRECIST, time to progression, overall survival, complications, primary site, tumor grade and degree of differentiation, volume of liver disease, extrahepatic disease, NET-related symptoms, comorbidities, Child–Pugh score, performance status, lobar versus selective embolization, and arteriovenous shunting. Results: Initial response was higher for TAE using particles < 100 versus TAE using only particles ≥ 100 μm (64 vs 42%, p = 0.007). Multivariate logistic regression showed that use of particles < 100 μm and liver < 50% replaced with tumor were independent predictors of a better initial response rate. There was no difference in major or minor complications between the two particle size groups. Median overall survival after TAE was 55 months for well- to moderately differentiated NET and 13 months for poorly differentiated or undifferentiated NET. There was no significant difference in survival between TAE patients treated with < 100 versus only ≥ 100-μm particles. Conclusion: NET patients treated with TAE using particles < 100 μm had better initial response, but the same overall survival, compared to TAE using only particles ≥ 100 μm. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE).","Carcinoid; Neuroendocrine tumor; Particle size; Transarterial embolization",Review,Scopus

However, organoid culture technologies often involve the use of biologically-derived materials (e.g. Matrigel™) that do not allow dissection of the independent contributions of the biochemical and biophysical matrix properties to organoid development. Additionally, their inherent lot-to-lot variability and, in the case of Matrigel™ tumor-derived nature limits their applicability as platforms for drug and tissue transplantation therapies. Here, we highlight recent studies that overcome these limitations through engineering of novel biomaterial platforms that (1) allow to study the independent contributions of physicochemical matrix properties to organoid development and their potential for translational therapies, and (2) better recreate the tumor microenvironment for high-throughput, pre-clinical drug development. These studies illustrate how innovative biomaterial constructs can contribute to the modeling of human development and disease using organoids, and as platforms for development of organoid-based therapies.

These nanoplatforms are after that further coated to avoid a potential QDs release. To protect the QDs from potential release or dissolution, two wrapping methods are developed: (i) a further coating with a silica shell having small pores (≤2 nm) or (ii) a tight polysaccharide shell deposited on the surface of these STMS@QDs particles via an original isobutyramide (IBAM)-mediated method. Both wrapping approaches yield to novel luminescent nanoplatforms displaying a highly controlled structure, a high size monodispersity (ca. 200 and 100 nm respectively) and colloidal stability in aqueous solutions. Among both methods, the IBAM-polysaccharide coating approach is shown the most suitable to ensure QDs protection and to avoid metal cation release over three months.

We previously showed that the expression of Hsp70 is regulated by the cytokine signaling transcription factor Stat3, but the role of Stat3 in thermotolerance is not known. In this study, we examined the possible involvement of Stat3 in the acquisition of thermotolerance. We found that severe heat shock-induced morphological changes and decreases in cell viability, which were suppressed by exposure to non-lethal mild heat shock prior to severe heat shock. This thermotolerance development was accompanied by Stat3 phosphorylation and the induction of Hsps such as Hsp105, Hsp70, and Hsp27. Stat3 phosphorylation and Hsp induction were inhibited by AG490, an inhibitor of JAK tyrosine kinase. Consistent with this, we found that mild heat shock-induced thermotolerance was partially suppressed by AG490 or knockdown of Hsp105. We also found that the Stat3 inhibitor Stattic suppresses the acquisition of thermotolerance by inhibiting the mild heat shock-induced Stat3 phosphorylation and Hsp105 expression. These results suggest that the mild heat shock-dependent stimulation of the JAK-Stat signaling pathway contributes to the development of thermotolerance via the induction of Hsps including Hsp105.

This complexity makes it often difficult if not impossible to study their inner workings. In order to address complex research questions more simply structured models (e.g., microorganisms, plants, non-vertebrate animals) are utilized. Findings from these studies can then be translated to more complex systems like mammals. This strategy facilitates the identification of relevant ‘leads’ that can be specifically addressed in the higher organism. In this review studies to elucidate the relevance, modes of action and molecular targets of reactive carbonyl species using simple model systems are discussed. These dicarbonyls are formed during metabolic activity in all organisms as toxic by-products that lead to the dysfunction of essential cellular components by a process termed glycation, resulting ultimately in the generation of advanced glycation end-products. Understanding how both dicarbonyls and advanced glycation end-products are formed, which environmental conditions influence their levels and what cellular pathways they affect is paramount to develop efficient strategies targeting diseases that are related to reactive carbonyl species, like diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer.

It is not established whether embolisation of segment 4 in addition RPVE (RPVE + 4) induces greater hypertrophy of the FRL. Limitations of prior studies include heterogenous populations and use of hypertrophy metrics sensitive to baseline variables. Methods: From 2010 to 2015, consecutive patients undergoing RPVE or RPVE + 4 for CRLM, who had not undergone prior major hepatic resection and in whom imaging was available, were included in a retrospective study. Data were extracted from hospital electronic records. Volumetric assessments of segments 2–3 were made on cross-sectional imaging before and after embolisation and corrected for standardised liver volume. Results: Ninety-nine patients underwent PVE, and 60 met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-eight patients underwent RPVE, and 22 underwent RPVE + 4. Forty-five patients had undergone median 6 cycles of prior chemotherapy. Eighteen patients had FRL metastases at PVE, and 16 had undergone subsegmental metastasectomy in the FRL. Assessments of the degree of hypertrophy (DH) of segments 2/3 were made at median 35 (interquartile range 30–49) days after PVE. RPVE + 4 resulted in a significantly greater increase in DH than RPVE (7.7 ± 1.8% vs 11.3 ± 2.6%, p = 0.011). No confounding association between baseline variables and the decision to undertake RPVE or RPVE + 4 was identified. Median survival was 2.4 years and was not influenced by segment 4 embolisation. Conclusion: RPVE + 4 results in greater DH of segments 2/3 than RPVE in people with CLRM. © 2019, The Author(s).","Colorectal liver metastasis; Future remnant liver; Hepatectomy; Liver regeneration; Portal vein; Therapeutic embolisation",Article,Scopus

The IONCs, were subsequently loaded with the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6), doxorubicin (DOX) and a layer of tetradecanol (PCM, a temperature sensitive phase-change material used as a smart switch for drug release).

Unlike conventional fluorescence based strategies SERS provides narrow spectral bandwidths, fluorescence quenching and multiplexing ability, and fitting attribute with short length probe DNA sequences. Herein, we report a novel and PCR free SERS based DNA detection strategy involving dual platforms and short DNA probes for the detection of endangered species, Malayan box turtle (MBT) (Cuora amboinensis). In this biosensing feature, the detection is based on the covalent linking of the two platforms involving graphene oxide-gold nanoparticles (GO-AuNPs) functionalized with capture probe 1 and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) modified with capture probe 2 and Raman dye (Cy3) via hybridization with the corresponding target sequences. Coupling of the two platforms generates locally enhanced electromagnetic field ‘hot spot’, formed at the junctions and interstitial crevices of the nanostructures and consequently provide significant amplification of the SERS signal. Therefore, employing the two SERS active substrates and short-length probe DNA sequences, we have managed to improve the sensitivity of the biosensors to achieve a lowest limit of detection (LOD) as low as 10 fM. Furthermore, the fabricated biosensor exhibited sensitivity even for single nucleotide base-mismatch in the target DNA as well as showed excellent performance to discriminate closely related six non-target DNA sequences. Although the developed SERS biosensor would be an attractive platform for the authentication of MBT from diverse samples including forensic and/or archaeological specimens, it could have universal application for detecting gene specific biomarkers for many diseases including cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","DNA biosensor; Graphene oxide-gold nanoparticles; Malayan box turtle; Sandwich biosensor; Short-length DNA probe; Surface-enhanced Raman scattering",Article,Scopus

In this work, we first synthesized Au seed particles with a diameter of 15.8 nm using a sodium citrate reduction method, and coated Au seeds with polyvinylpyrrolidone for further growth of solid silica shell/mesoporous silica outer shell onto the Au seeds. After treatment via selective etching to remove solid silica shell, amination of surface of the particles, and filling of PFH into the internal cavity of the spheres with a diameter of 182.1 nm, PDA coating was performed to render the particles with an external shell thickness of 15.1 nm. The formed hybrid particles with a size of 212.2 nm are colloidally stable and exhibit good cytocompatibility, and display excellent PA/US/CT/thermal imaging property due to the co-presence of PDA, PFH, and Au nanoparticles.

In the present study, we focused on the transgenerational effects of DPM in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) exposed in either maternal generation (F0) or consecutive generations (F0-F5). In maternal exposure manner, 0.1 and 1.0 µg/mL DPM significantly increased the germ cell apoptosis at F0 generation, while the number of apoptotic germ cells at F1-F5 generation were gradually recovered back to control level. The brood size were significantly reduced by DPM at F2 generation and recovered to control level at F3-F5 generations. In continuous exposure manner, although 0.1 and 1.0 µg/mL DPM induced significant germ cell apoptosis in F0 generation, there was no difference between F0 and other generations. Continuous exposure to DPM at 0.1 and 1.0 µg/mL impaired the brood size in F2 to F5 generations.

Therefore, it is important to know how the corrosion of a metal device implanted in the human body causes clinically significant problems and it is necessary to develop an in vivo method to examine the condition of the implant. Raman spectroscopy offers the possibility of inserting a Raman probe into the vicinity of the implant to determine the surface condition of the implant and the content of titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) in the surrounding area. For this purpose, trace elements in human body fluids; e. g., peptides, can be used. For the above reasons, in this work the surfaces of Ti plate and TiO 2 (anatase and rutile) nanostructures (TiO 2 NPs) were characterized using ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), Raman, and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopies as well as scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDS) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD).

Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) was used to monitor the geometry of adsorbate, to separate, enrich, and detect a variety of BN fragments in a physiological environment and to determine the type of surface (Ti vs TiO 2 ).

This was a major breakthrough that resulted in the development of new rapamycin analogs as anti-cancer agents, and launched new research that revealed the pre-eminent biological role of mTOR (mammalian or mechanistic TOR). Beyond mediating rapamycin sensitivity, the TOR proteins are nutrient sensing protein kinases, conserved from yeast to man, with a core function in regulating cell growth, metabolism and overall cell survival. There have been many insightful historical accounts of the origins of TOR; however, the complete TOR dossier would benefit from a chapter on the untold story of the simultaneous co-discovery of the yeast TOR proteins by two independent laboratories, one that is inclusive of the discoveries made at the former SmithKline Beecham (legacy GlaxoSmithKline). Accordingly, this comprehensive retrospective retraces the provenance of yeast TOR (circa 1990–1996) and highlights the early groundbreaking publications that revealed the identity of the TOR genes and proteins. It also commemorates key companion papers which helped to clarify yeast TOR gene nomenclature, identified structural motifs in the predicted TOR protein sequences, demonstrated interactions between yeast FKBP12-rapamycin and TOR, characterized mutations responsible for drug resistance, and began to decipher TOR protein function; some of these crucial early studies appeared in this journal (e.g., Koser et al., 1993.

A period of intensive investigation, events are portrayed chronologically and juxtaposed alongside the independent parallel efforts to identify and purify mTOR. Finally, in a broader historical context, TOR and mTOR are examined a posteriori as paragons of multiple discovery, illustrating how this common phenomenon (also known as simultaneous invention) can greatly accelerate problem solving and advance human knowledge in a fast-breaking area of scientific research. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","History; mTOR; Multiple discovery; Rapamycin; TOR; Yeast",Review,Scopus

Meanwhile, relevant deep features can significantly enhance learnable expert and intelligent systems performance and reduce diagnosis time and arduousness. This paper presents a deep learning-based radiomics framework for aided diagnosis of soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. MR Images with histologically confirmed Liposarcoma (LPS) and Leiomyosarcomas (LMS) have been retrieved from the Cancer Imaging Archives database and pre-processed to recuperate ROIs from MR scans with delineated tumors. This study investigates the significance and impact of medical image fusion on deep feature learning based on transfer learning from the natural domain to the medical domain. Towards this end, we propose to fuse T1 with T2FS or STIR modalities using type-2 fuzzy sets in the non-subsampled shearlet domain. Being decomposed, low-frequency sub-images were selected using local energy and type-2 fuzzy entropy, while high frequencies were selected according to the maximum of the absolute value. Experimental results indicated that the proposed fusion framework outperformed the state-of-the-art fuzzy logic-based fusion techniques in terms of entropy and mutual information. Accordingly, we fine-tuned the pre-trained AlexNet deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). First, with the pre-processed dataset, and second with the fused images. As a result, the average classification accuracy using the augmented training data by image rotation and flipping was 97.17% with the raw data and 98.28% with the fused images, which highlighted the usefulness of complementary information for deep feature learning. One crucial concern was to investigate the depth of knowledge transferability. We incrementally fine-tuned the pre-trained CNN to assess the required level that achieves performance improvements in STS classification. Through layer-wise fine-tuning, our study further confirms the potential of middle and deep layers in performance improvement. Moreover, the transferability was concluded better than random weights. With the encouragement of classification results, our aided diagnosis framework may be in the pipeline to assist radiologists in classifying LPS and LMS. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Convolutional Neural Networks; Multi-modal medical image fusion and classification; Soft tissue sarcoma; Transfer learning; Type-2 fuzzy logic",Article,Scopus

We have two applications in mind. The first one is normal-to-abnormal image registration in the presence of tumor-induced topology differences. The second one is biophysical inversion based on single-time patient data. The underlying optimization problem is highly non-linear and non-convex and has not been solved before with a gradient-based approach. Given the segmentation of a normal brain MRI and the segmentation of a cancer patient MRI, we determine tumor growth parameters and a registration map so that if we “grow a tumor” (using our tumor model) in the normal brain and then register it to the patient image, then the registration mismatch is as small as possible. This “coupled problem” two-way couples the biophysical inversion and the registration problem. In the image registration step we solve a large-deformation diffeomorphic registration problem parameterized by an Eulerian velocity field. In the biophysical inversion step we estimate parameters in a reaction–diffusion tumor growth model that is formulated as a partial differential equation (PDE). In SIBIA, we couple these two sub-components in an iterative manner. We first presented the components of SIBIA in “Gholami et al., Framework for Scalable Biophysics-based Image Analysis, IEEE/ACM Proceedings of the SC2017” in which we derived parallel distributed memory algorithms and software modules for the decoupled registration and biophysical inverse problems. In this paper, our contributions are the introduction of a PDE-constrained optimization formulation of the coupled problem, and the derivation of a Picard iterative solution scheme. We perform extensive tests to experimentally assess the performance of our method on synthetic and clinical datasets. We demonstrate the convergence of the SIBIA optimization solver in different usage scenarios. We demonstrate that using SIBIA, we can accurately solve the coupled problem in three dimensions (256 3 resolution) in a few minutes using 11 dual-x86 nodes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Adjoint-based methods; Atlas registration; Biophysically constrained diffeomorphic image registration; Parallel algorithms; Tumor growth",Article,Scopus

In our experiments, we modeled tumor endothelium by culturing a monolayer of murine endothelial cells (2H11) on transwell membrane. We locally disrupted the cultured endothelium to enhance drug penetration by using perfluorocarbon liquid droplets as breaking probes and protoporphyrin IX hybridized liposomes as drug carriers. We also demonstrated an on-demand release of GEM by digitally triggering the break of drug carriers. Moreover, we validated the acoustic tumor endothelium disruption in vivo by monitoring penetration of dye (Evans blue) in solid tumors.

Most of the reported telomerase assays suffer from the repeating thermal cycles, laborious protocols, expensive instruments and the limited sensitivity. To solve these issues, we develop a new telomerase assay based on telomerization-driven release of fluorescent 2-aminopurine. We designed a 2-aminopurine molecular beacon in which the fluorescence of 2-aminopurine is quenched due to stacking interaction effect without the use of extra quenchers. The presence of target telomerase can open the 2-aminopurine molecular beacon, triggering a quadratic signal amplification reaction to digest abundant 2-aminopurine molecular beacons, releasing large amounts of free 2-aminopurine molecules with strong fluorescence emission. Due to the inherent low background signal of 2-aminopurine molecular beacon and the highly efficient telomerization-driven quadratic signal amplification, this method exhibits high sensitivity with a limit of detection equivalent to 1 human lung cancer A549 cell and a large dynamic range of 4 orders of magnitude from 1 to 10000 cells. Moreover, this method can be further applied for telomerase inhibition assay and the discrimination of cancer cells from normal cells, holding great potential in telomerase-related clinical diagnosis and drug discovery. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Fluorescence detection; Lung cancer; Molecular beacon; Signal amplification; Telomerase",Article,Scopus

However, current in vivo tumorigenicity assays can be time-consuming and results can be equivocal, especially for weakly tumorigenic cells. Basement membrane extract (BME) derived from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse tumor, such as Matrigel and Cultrex, consists of laminin, collagen IV, entactin, heparan sulfate, and proteoglycans, as well as biologically active peptides and growth factors. For nearly three decades, BME has been used in cancer research to enhance tumorigenicity assays (both tumor “take” as well as tumor growth are substantially improved). We assessed the feasibility of using BME to facilitate the evaluation of vaccine cell substrate tumorigenicity. Vero cells (WHO 10-87) were serially passaged and banked at every ten passages beginning with p140; for the present study, low-passage Vero cells (Vero LP, originating from cells banked at p140) and high-passage Vero cells (Vero HP, originating from cells banked at p250) were used. In addition, Vero TPX2 and Vero NM1, cell lines established from tumors formed in nude mice by Vero HP cells, as well as other cell lines relevant to vaccine production (HeLa, MDCK, 293, and ARPE-19), were assessed. Female adult athymic nude mice were injected subcutaneously with cells in the absence or presence of BME. We observed that the tumorigenicity of ARPE-19 cells as well as Vero cells below passage 258 (Vero LP and Vero HP; previously characterized as non-tumorigenic or weakly tumorigenic, respectively) was not enhanced by BME.

Here we report a novel FRET strategy based on fluorescence-enhanced p19 proteins-conjugated single quantum dot (QD) with multiplex antenna for one-step, specific and sensitive miRNAs quantitative analysis. It is simple in design and operation, and possesses high sensitivity and selectivity. In the strategy, RNA-binding viral p19 proteins-conjugated quantum dot (p19-QD) with high fluorescence and multiplex antenna was designed, and exploited for the capture recognition element and the donor. In the presence of target miRNAs, the p19-QD would tightly capture the miRNA-21-antimiRNA-21 duplex (dsRNA) formed in solution by hybridization of the specific antimiRNA-21-Cy3 probe (receptor) to the single-stranded miRNA-21 target. The FRET detection system between QD and Cy3 was constructed, and the signal read-out was measured. Conversely, in the absence of target miRNA-21, the p19-QD refuse to capture the free single-stranded antimiRNA-21-Cy3 probe (receptor), the FRET between quantum dot and Cy3 is deterred, thereby providing a low-background signal to improve sensitivity. Benefiting from the high affinity and specificity of p19 protein for duplex RNA and the fluorescence enhancement of donor p19-QD by the passivation and protection from p19 protein, a detection limit as low as 0.6 fM was achieved without employing any amplification techniques and pre-concentration or purification steps. The performance can be achieved by only one-step incubation without additional reagents and washing steps, thus greatly reducing the operating difficulty and saving time. Moreover, the fluorescence-enhanced p19-QD conjugate-based FRET strategy avoids the specific design in the number of the bases for interval in the DNA-QD conjugate-based FRET system using DNA strands as the FRET linker, and improves the FRET efficiency. Furthermore, it has been successfully applied to analyze the content of miRNA-21 in breast cancer cell. The results indicated that, the strategy will become a sensitive and reliable miRNAs quantification method in biomedical research and early clinical diagnostics. © 2018","FRET; Homogeneous assay; MiRNA-21; P19 protein; Quantum dot (QD)",Article,Scopus

Numerous experimental setups have been developed to encapsulate living cells in microbeads using different microfluidic devices and materials. Previous studies have investigated different microfluidic devices and materials for use in cancer treatment, drug delivery, environmental remediation, food production, and cell culture contexts. Some of the current challenges to these setups are maintaining reasonable levels of cell viability, cell leaching, nutrient and oxygen diffusion, and ensuring uniform microbead shape and size distribution. Addressing these issues and identifying the most reproducible and convenient setup enables researchers to efficiently encapsulate living cells and further advance the biomedical field. The efficiency of microencapsulation in terms of cell viability and uniform microbead shape and size distribution are directly related to the type of device used and the cross-linking method applied. Hence, the focus of this review is to assess the effects of using T-junction, flow-focusing, and co-flow microfluidic devices as well as thermal, ionic, and photo cross-linking methods for the microencapsulation of living cells.

The transcriptional level of ROS-generating oxidase NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) is high in CD133 + thyroid cancer cells. Activation of STAT3 through phosphorylation is responsible for high activation of NOX1 transcription in CD133 + thyroid cancer cells. Knock down of NOX1 obviously reduced the level of ROS and inhibited the self-renewal activity and tumorigenicity of CD133 + thyroid cancer cells. Furthermore, knock down of NOX1 reduced the activity of PI3K/Akt pathway. Overexpression of active form of Akt rescued the negative effect of NOX1 knockdown on the self-renewal capability of CD133 + thyroid cancer cells.

In the current study, we evaluated the anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects of 2′-hydroxyflavanone (2HF) and RLIP inhibition in an array of triple-negative BC cell lines and an orthotopic mouse model of breast-to-lung metastasis. Compared to control treatment, RLIP inhibition reduced in-vitro cell viability and suppressed the migratory and invasive potential of BC cells. In-vitro studies showed that 2HF treatment reduced the expression of RLIP, KRAS, pERK, pSTAT3, and pP70S6K. Further, mice orthotopically implanted with lung-seeking luciferase-expressing TMD231 cells were treated with 2HF (50 mg/kg, b.w.), RLIP antisense (RAS; 5 mg/kg, b.w.), RLIP antibody (Rab; 5 mg/kg, b.w.) or a combination of 2HF + RAS + Rab. 2HF-, RAS-, and Rab-treated mice exhibited significantly lower primary tumor weight and reduced lung metastasis compared to control mice.

CBD experiments were performed using the CRC cell lines HCT116 and DLD-1. CBD induced apoptosis by regulating many pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, of which Noxa showed significantly higher expression. To understand the relationship between Noxa and CBD-induced apoptosis, Noxa levels were downregulated using siRNA, and the expression of apoptosis markers decreased. After ROS production was blocked, the level of Noxa also decreased, suggesting that ROS is involved in the regulation of Noxa, which along with ROS is a well-known pro-apoptotic signaling agents. As a result, CBD induced apoptosis in a Noxa-and-ROS-dependent manner.

We hypothesized that microRNA-based negative regulation of PAK4 would reduce L1CAM-induced NSCLC aggressiveness via destabilizing Slug. We found that elevated L1CAM expression was tightly correlated with p53 loss-of-function and reduced NSCLC patient survival. L1CAM suppression reduced NSCLC cell migration and invasiveness in vitro as well as tumor formation and distal metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, p53 restricts L1CAM expression through the β-catenin/Slug pathway, with levels of β-catenin and Slug positively correlating with L1CAM expression in NSCLC tumors. The microRNA miR-193a-3p directly targets PAK4 and suppresses downstream p-Slug and L1CAM expression. Silencing PAK4, Slug, and L1CAM mirrored miR-193a-3p's effects upon the migration and invasiveness of NSCLC cells in vitro. Decreased miR-193a-3p levels correlated with elevated PAK4, p-Slug, and L1CAM levels in NSCLC tumors.

The involvement of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and in particular microRNAs (miRNAs) in post-transcriptional gene regulation is well established. miRNAs are short sequences (18–25 nucleotides) that can bind to the 3 ′UTR sequence of the targeted messenger RNA (mRNA), leading to its degradation or translational repression. Interactions between the ING family and miRNAs have been described in some cancers but also in other diseases. The involvement of miRNAs in ING family regulation opens up new fields of investigation, particularly for targeted therapies.

We propose that in comparison to the wild-type shPD-L1, the further affinity enhancement will confer the molecule with opposite characteristics that augment T-cell activation and immunotherapeutic drug potential. In this study, a new shPD-L1 variant, L3C7c, has been generated to demonstrate ∼167 fold greater affinity than wild-type hPD-L1. The L3C7c-Fc fusion protein demonstrated completely opposite effects of conventional PD-1 axis by promoting redirected T-cell proliferation, activation and cytotoxicity in vitro, as being slightly better than that of anti-PD1-Ab (Pembrolizumab). Moreover, L3C7c-Fc was more effective than Pembrolizumab in enhancing redirected T cells’ ability to suppress Mel624 melanoma growth in vivo. As a downsized L3C7c-Fc variant, L3C7v-Fc improved the anti-tumor efficacy in vivo when combined with dendritic cell vaccines.

We studied the potential of single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) specific for MMR to target proteins to MMR + TAMs. Anti-MMR sdAbs were genetically coupled to a reporter protein, mWasabi (wasabi green, WG), generating sdAb “drug” fusion proteins (SFPs), referred to as WG-SFPs.

Therefore, this study has been designed to analyze heavy metal contaminations in 88 street dusts collected from the 22 high traffic sites and industrial areas of the Southeast Asian Megacity: Dhaka (capital of Bangladesh) using energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectroscopy. This study revealed that the maximum Pb, Cd, Zn, Cr, Ni, As, Mn and Cu contents in the street dust samples were 18.9, 11.6, 239.2, 144.3, 37.1, 8.1, 261.5 and 49.6 mg/ kg respectively in which Ni and Pb concentration were 2 times, and Cd concentration was 200 times higher than the background level in soil; and As concentration was slightly higher than soil background level. The spatial distribution of heavy metal concentrations in street dust samples in Dhaka City was revealed that the hot spot areas of Pb, Ni, Cd and As were mainly associated with heavy traffic and industrial activities. The risk assessment strategies were used for this study for identifying the routes of exposure through oral ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact by the fine particles (~75 μm) of street dust, especially for children based on the US EPA health risk models. Both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks of heavy metals were characterized in street dust samples. Results based on the hazard index (HI), in the case of non-cancer effect, the ingestion of dust particles of children and adults in Dhaka City appeared to be the route of exposure to street dust that results in a higher risk for heavy metals, followed by dermal contact. This study revealed that the inhalation of re-suspended particles through mouth and nose were almost negligible. It was also noticed that children were experiencing the potential health risk due to HI for Cr (1.04), which was slightly higher than the safe level 1, and Cd (0.69) was close to the safe level 1. Reversely, cancer risk for Cr (i.e. 4.27 × 10 −6 ) was fallen within the range of threshold values (10 −4 to 10 −6 ) and As (i.e. 9.59 × 10 −7 ) was close to the upper limit of threshold values (10 −4 to 10 −6 ). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cancer; Health risk assessment; Pollution; Street dust; Toxic elements",Article,Scopus

Rpn10 is the major ubiquitin (Ub) receptor of the 26S proteasome. Mounting evidence shows that Rpn10 is associated with the progression of several tumor types. However, little is known regarding the mechanistic role of Rpn10 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we found that the upregulation of Rpn10 in HCC was associated with poor prognosis. The ectopic overexpression of Rpn10 increased HCC cell proliferation, whereas silencing Rpn10 expression resulted in decreased cell proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that knockdown of Rpn10 induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase in HCC cells. In addition, we found that Rpn10 increased cell proliferation via regulation of the PTEN/Akt pathways. Knockdown of Rpn10 induced suppression of cell proliferation could be reversed by overexpressing active Akt in HCC cells. Rpn10 directly promoted PTEN degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The transcription factor HIF1α directly bound to the Rpn10 promoter and increased its expression in HCC tissue. Moreover, we observed a significant correlation between HIF1α expression and Rpn10 levels in HCC patients and found that the combination of these two parameters was a more powerful predictor of poor prognosis than either parameter alone.

Ectopic expression of miR-BART13 promoted NPC cell proliferation, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and metastasis in vitro, and facilitated xenograft tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Molecularly, NF-κB inhibitor interacting Ras-like 2 (NKIRAS2), a negative regulator of the NF-κB signaling, was identified to be a direct target of miR-BART13 in NPC cells, and NKIRAS2 mRNA and protein expression was inversely correlated with miR-BART13 in NPC tissues, respecitvely.

Despite its low resolution, dynamic light scattering (DLS) is the most common sizing technique since the onset of NEP in pharmaceutical technologies. Considering the limitations of the existing sizing measurements and the challenges posed by complex NEPs both scientists and regulators encourage the combination of multiple orthogonal high-resolution approaches to shed light in the NEP sizing space (e.g. dynamic light scattering, electron microscopy, field flow fractionation coupled to online sizing detectors, centrifugal techniques, particle tracking analysis and tunable resistive pulse sensing). The pharmaceutical and biotechnology developers are now challenged to find their own pragmatic characterisation approaches, which should be fit for purpose and minimize costs at the same time, in a complicated landscape where only a few standards exist. In order to support the community, the European Nanomedicine Characterisation Laboratory (EUNCL) and the US National Cancer Institute Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory (NCI-NCL) have jointly developed multiple standard operating procedures (SOPs) for NEP assessment, including the measurements of particle size distribution, and are offering wide access to their ‘state of the art’ characterisation platforms, in addition to making SOPs publicly available.

Test cases are presented to demonstrate: i) the need for employing at least one high-resolution sizing technique, ii) the importance of selecting the correct sizing techniques for the purpose, and iii) the robustness of utilizing orthogonal sizing techniques to study the physical properties of complex NEP samples. © 2019 The Authors","Morphology; Nanomedicine; Nanoparticles enabled medicinal products; Particle size distribution; Physico-chemical properties; Standard operating procedures (SOPs)",Review,Scopus

We then use this framework to explore models in which resistance is attained by either mutations (irreversible) or plasticity (reversible). Numerical results suggest that punctuated evolutionary assumptions are more consistent with results obtained from murine melanoma models than gradual evolution. Furthermore, in the context of an evolving tumour cell population, sequencing the treatment, for instance applying immunotherapy before BRAF inhibitors, can increase treatment effectiveness. However, drug strategies which showed success within a spatially homogeneous tumour environment were unsuccessful under heterogeneous conditions, suggesting that spatio-environmental heterogeneity may be the greatest challenge to tumour therapies. Plastic metabolic models are additionally capable of reproducing the characteristic resistant tumour volume curves and predicting re-sensitisation to secondary waves of treatment observed in patient derived xenograft (PDX) melanomas treated with MEK and BRAF inhibitors. Nevertheless, secondary relapse due to a pre-adapted subpopulation, remaining after the first wave of treatment, results in a more rapid development of resistance. Our model provides a framework through which tumour resistance can be understood and would suggest that carefully phased treatments may be able to overcome the development of long-term resistance in melanoma. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cancer evolution; Heterogeneity; Melanoma; Spatio-Structural models; Systems biology",Article,Scopus

The mitochondrion has been implicated in the apoptotic process and, recently has been targeted in cancer therapy because of its role in cancer progression. Medicinal plants are used in the treatment of cancer, in particular, Calliandra portoricensis (CP) in the management of prostate cancer in Nigeria ethnomedicine. Aim of the study: This study was designed to investigate the effects of CP on mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis and cell proliferation using prostate cancer cells. Materials and methods: Prostatic LNCaP, DU-145, lung adenocarcinoma and healthy VERO cells were used to assess cell proliferation. Cell cycle analysis was evaluated by flow cytometry. Levels of pro-apoptotic Bax, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Cytochrome C Release (CCR) and activation of caspases 3(C3) and 9 (C9) were determined by ELISA, while mitochondrial integrity was evaluated by Fluorescent Intensity Ratio (FIR). Results: Methanol Fraction of C. portoricensis (MFCP) inhibited proliferation of prostatic LNCaP, DU-145, lung adenocarcinoma and healthy VERO cells with IC50 values of 2.4 ± 0.2, 3.3 ± 0.2, 3.6 ± 0.2 and 17.9 ± 1.6 µg/mL, respectively. The growth inhibition by MFCP correlated with a 3-fold decreased expression of Bcl-2 and a 4-fold increase in Bax levels at 10 µg/mL in LNCaP cells. Furthermore, MFCP caused a 3.5-fold reduction in FIR at 10 µg/mL and induced CCR by 4.2 folds at the same concentration relative to control. The MFCP-induced CCR is associated with activation of C3 and C9 at 10 µg/mL by 4.2 and 5.1 folds, respectively which prompted cancer cells to arrest at S phase. The LC-MS analysis revealed the presence of polyphenols including gallic acid and afzelechin in MFCP. Conclusion: Taken together, MFCP- induced cell death is mediated by alteration of mitochondrial integrity and cell cycle arrest. Hence, methanol fraction of C. portoricensis may be effective for cancer pharmacotherapy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Apoptosis; Calliandra portoricensis; Cancer; Cell proliferation; Cytochrome C; Mitochondria",Article,Scopus

Blume, locally known in Malaysia as “Pecah kaca” or “Jin batu”, has been traditionally used for treatment of various ailments including cancer. We previously demonstrated that a standardized bioactive subfraction of S. crispus, termed as F3, possessed potent anticancer effects in both in vitro and in vivo breast cancer models. Aim of the study: To investigate the potential of F3 from S. crispus to prevent metastasis in breast cancer. Materials and methods: The antimetastatic effects of F3 were first investigated on murine 4T1 and human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell (BCC) lines using cell proliferation, wound healing and invasion assays. A 4T1-induced mouse mammary carcinoma model was then used to determine the expression of metastasis tumor markers, epithelial (E)-cadherin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, mucin (MUC)-1, nonepithelial (N)-cadherin, Twist, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and vimentin, using immunohistochemistry, following oral treatment with F3 for 30 days. Results: Significant growth arrest was observed with F3 IC50 values of 84.27 µg/ml (24 h) and 74.41 µg/ml (48 h) for MDA-MB-231, and 87.35 µg/ml (24 h) and 78.75 µg/ml (48 h) for 4T1 cells. F3 significantly inhibited migration of both BCC lines at 50 μg/ml for 24 h (p = 0.018 and p = 0.015, respectively). Similarly, significant inhibition of invasion was demonstrated in 4T1 (75 µg/ml, p = 0.016) and MDA-MB-231 (50 µg/ml, p = 0.040) cells compared to the untreated cultures. F3 treatment resulted in reduced tumor growth compared to untreated mice (p &lt; 0.01) or mice treated with tamoxifen (p &lt; 0.05). Statistical parameters (absolute count, proportion, intensity and overall scores) indicating upregulation of E-cadherin expression were statistically significant in F3-treated compared to the untreated tumor-bearing mice. Similarly, F3 significantly reduced the expression of MMP-9, MUC1, N-cadherin, Twist, VEGF and vimentin in comparison with the TM (p &lt; 0.01) group Conclusions: Our findings suggest that F3 exerts anti-metastatic effects independent of its cytotoxic effects, and these are supported by the increased expression of E-cadherin concurrent with downregulation of MMP-9, MUC1, N-cadherin, Twist, VEGF and vimentin expression in breast cancer. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","4T1; Anti-invasion; Antimetastasis; Antimigration; MDA-MB-231; Strobilanthes crispus",Article,Scopus

They play diverse roles in cellular recognition and signalling processes, as well as in infections and cancer metastasis. Owing to their specificity, lectins find application in biotechnology and medicine, e.g. for blood group typing, purification of glycoproteins or lipids and as markers that target cancer cells. For some applications, lectins are immobilized on a solid support, or they are conjugated with other molecules. Classical protein conjugation reactions at nucleophilic amino acids such as cysteine or lysine are often non-selective, and the site of conjugation is difficult to pre-define. Random conjugation, however, can interfere with protein function. Therefore, we sought to equip lectins with a unique reactive handle, which can be conjugated with other molecules in a pre-defined manner. We site-specifically introduced non-canonical amino acids carrying bioorthogonal reactive groups into several lectins. As a proof of principle, we conjugated these ‘clickable lectins’ with small molecules. Furthermore, we conjugated lectins with different ligand specificities with one another to produce superlectins. The ‘clickable lectins’ might be useful for any process where lectins shall be conjugated with another module in a selective, pre-defined and site-specific manner. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Modified Sijunzi decoctions have been extensively used to treat cachexia and improve the quality of life of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Aim of the study: This study was aimed to provide comprehensive evidence for the anti-cachectic effect of a modified Sijunzi decoction (Zhen-Qi; ZQ-SJZ) and characterize its anti-cachectic mechanism, especially in cisplatin-induced muscle atrophy. Materials and methods: We employed a Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)-induced cancer cachectic mouse model to demonstrate the anti-cachectic effect of ZQ-SJZ. Moreover, we provided an in vitro C2C12 myotube formation model to investigate the effect of ZQ-SJZ in hampering cisplatin-induced muscle atrophy. Results: The administration of ZQ-SJZ can recover tumor- and/or cisplatin-induced body weight loss, intestinal mucosal damage, as well as forelimb grip strength and myofiber size. The administration of ZQ-SJZ also significantly prolonged the survival of LLC-induced cachectic mice under cisplatin treatment. Mechanistically, ZQ-SJZ increased the levels of myogenic proteins, such as myosin heavy chain (MyHC) and myogenin, and decreased the atrophy-related protein, atrogin-1, in cisplatin-treated C2C12 myotubes in vitro. In addition, cisplatin-induced mitochondria dysfunction could be hampered by the co-administration of ZQ-SJZ, by which it recovered the cisplatin-mediated decrease in PGC-1α and PKM1 levels. Conclusions: The administration of ZQ-SJZ can recover tumor- and/or cisplatin-induced cachectic conditions and significantly prolong the survival of LLC-induced cachectic mice under cisplatin treatment. The profound effect of ZQ-SJZ in hampering tumor- and/or cisplatin-induced cachexia may be due to its modulation of the mitochondrial function and subsequent myogenesis.

Aim: As most previous pharmacological tests used the crude oleoresin and only a few studies so far dealt with enriched fractions or pure chemically defined compounds, the aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties of the Copaifera reticulata oleoresin and to assign traditional uses to specific secondary metabolites. Materials and methods: The oleoresin, as well as its neutral and acidic fractions were tested for their activity against six cancer cell lines, two clinically relevant bacterial strains, and two dermatophytes. Both fractions were analysed by GC-MS and UHPLC-ELSD, respectively. The antibacterial acidic phase was further fractionated by preparative chromatography to purify and characterize the compounds responsible for the observed pharmacological effect. Results: Whereas no cytotoxic activity was detected, the crude oleoresin and its acidic fraction showed antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecium (IC 50 values 4.2 and 4.8 µg/mL, respectively) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, IC 50 values 5.3 and 7.2 µg/mL, respectively). Purification of the acidic fraction of the C. reticulata oleoresin yielded two dicarboxylic diterpene acids and the four main diterpene acids, comprising three different diterpene scaffolds. Interestingly, the activity was not restricted to a particular diterpene-type but rather depended on the compounds’ lipophilicity, with the most active constituent showing IC 50 values of 1.6 (E. faecium) and 2.5 µg/mL (MRSA), respectively. Furthermore, ent-polyalthic acid, the major diterpenoid, was significantly active against dermatophytes with IC 50 values of 6.8 µg/mL (Trichophyton rubrum) and 4.3 µg/mL against (T. mentagrophytes).

Although new generation hormone therapy is a promising strategy, re-occurrence or emergence of drug resistance limits the success. According to the theory of cancer stem cells (CSCs); CSCs are immortal, tumor inducing and self renewing pluripotent cells and multiply as chemotherapy proceeds, making the chemotherapy inefficient. Emerging scientific reports indicate that the mechanisms of drug resistance are the main features that CSCs gain actually. Due to this fact, cancer stem cell markers should be clarified to target CSCs and this will play important role to reverse drug resistance. In this study, MCF-7/Pac, a cell line resistant to microtubule inhibitor paclitaxel and multiple drugs permanently, was used as a reference cell line for drug resistant mammary cancer. It has some properties that breast cancer stem cells possess so it is considerable to isolate breast cancer stem cell-like cells from MCF-7/Pac population. The chemotherapy resistant breast cancer stem–like (BCSC-like) cells were sorted from MCF-7/Pac population by using markers CD44, CD24 and ALDH. At the next step the proteins that are up-regulated in BCSC-like cells were determined by protein array analysis. Additionally the effect of paclitaxel on BCSC-like cell proliferation was determined. The MCF-7/Pac population contains 12.4% BCSC-like cells. The cells bearing BCSC-like cell phenotype exhibited resistance to paclitaxel. The over-expressed growth factors, MMP proteins, Frizzled proteins and IL-23 were found to be related to the BCSC-like cell proliferation.

Herein, we report a newly synthetic triazole analog of Jaridonin, DN3, which exhibits more potent antitumor activity via acting directly on mitochondria. DN3 potently reduced viabilities of gastric cancer cell lines HGC-27 and MGC-803 through inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. But, normal human gastric epithelial cell line GES-1 is more resistant to the growth inhibition by DN3 compared with gastric cancer cells. DN3 induced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) decrease and cytochrome c release in intact gastric cancer cell lines. Meanwhile, the DN3 treatment also caused the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria isolated from cancer cell lines in a mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex (PTPC) mediated manner, but not from mitochondria isolated from normal gastric epithelial cell. The induction of mitochondrial PTPC proteins voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and cyclophilin D (CypD) were also observed in DN3-treated cells. More interestingly, DN3 mediated MMP decrease, release of cytochrome c, the expression of VDAC and CypD and apoptosis were blocked by the pretreatment of VDAC1 inhibitor (4, 4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, DIDS) and CypD inhibitor (cyclosporine A, CsA). In a mouse xenograft model of human gastric cancer, the treatment of 5 mg/kg DN3 led to significant tumor regression without affecting body weight. In conclusion, our findings indicate that DN3 is a potential agent for the treatment of gastric cancer through acting directly on mitochondria, and would be useful for us to design more and better anti-cancer compounds. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Anti-tumor; CypD; Ent-kaurene diterpenoid derivative; Mitochondrion; VDAC1",Article,Scopus

Once spreading out, cell-selective delivery of drug appears especially critical. Here, we report on epidermal growth factor receptor and CD44 dual-targeted hyaluronic acid nanogels (EGFR/CD44-NGs) that afford enhanced targetability and protein therapy for metastatic 4T1 breast cancer in vivo. Flow cytometry in CD44 and EGFR-positive 4T1 metastatic breast cancer cells showed over 6-fold higher cellular uptake of EGFR/CD44-NGs than mono-targeting CD44-NGs. MTT and scratch assays displayed that saporin-loaded EGFR/CD44-NGs (Sap-EGFR/CD44-NGs) was highly potent in inhibiting growth as well as migration of 4T1 cells in vitro, with an IC 50 of 5.36 nM, which was 1.7-fold lower than that for Sap-CD44-NGs. In 4T1-luc metastatic breast cancer model in mice, Sap-EGFR/CD44-NGs exhibited significant inhibition of tumor metastasis to lung at a small dose of 3.33 nmol Sap equiv./kg. Increasing the dosage to 13.3 nmol Sap equiv./kg resulted in further reduced lung metastasis without causing notable adverse effects. These dual-targeted nanogels with improved cancer cell selectivity provide a novel platform for combating breast cancer metastasis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CD44; Epidermal growth factor receptor; Nanogels; Targeted delivery; Therapeutic proteins; Tumor metastasis",Article,Scopus

To explore this question, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the combinatorial effect of inducing autophagosome formation in human cervical cancer cells. Western blotting respectively assayed protein expression of LC3I, LC3II, Beclin-1, Autophagy-related protein 7 (Atg7), Autophagy-related protein 3 (Atg3), NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) and major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A (MICA). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay evaluated natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity in the presence of metformin and nelfinavir in combination or each drug alone. Using tumor xenografts in a nude mouse model, antitumor efficacy of the drug combination was assessed. We found that the drug combination could induce autophagosome formation in human cervical cancer cells. The biomarker proteins of autophagy, including Beclin-1, Atg7 and Atg3, decreased, but the ratios of LC3I/II increased. We also found that this drug combination sensitizes human cervical cancer cells to NK cell-mediated lysis by increasing the protein of SIRT3 and MICA. Moreover, this drug combination markedly induced autophagy of SiHa xenografts in nude mice. Therefore, it can be concluded that metformin, in combination with nelfinavir, can induce SIRT3/mROS-dependent autophagy and sensitize NK cell-mediated lysis in human cervical cancer cells and cervical cancer cell xenografts in nude mice. Thus, our findings have revealed the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumor effects of metformin in combination with nelfinavir in cervical cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Autophagy; Drug combination; Human cervical cancer; Metformin; Nelfinavir",Article,Scopus

However, its potential implication in human cancer is unclear. In this study, we have investigated the expression profile of MTMR14 and its functional impact in liver cancer for the first time. Expression analysis by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that MTMR14 expression is obviously overexpressed in liver cancer, and positively correlated with clinical stage. A loss-of-function study showed that knockdown of MTMR14 promotes cell apoptosis and inhibits cell migration. MTMR14 knockdown also inhibits tumor migration in vivo in liver cancer peritoneal implantation nude mouse model. A molecular mechanistic study by western blot showed that Knockdown MTMR14 causes downregulation of N-cadherin and E-cadherin, and promotes the cleavage and activation of caspase12, caspase9 and caspase3, but excluding caspase8. These results suggest that MTMR14 affects cell migration through N-cadherin and E-cadherin. Additionally, MTMR14 affects cell apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway but not the death receptor pathway.

QSAR models were calculated by CORAL software and optimal descriptors were calculated with SMILES and hydrogen suppressed molecular graph (HSG). The total dataset split into training, invisible training, calibration, and validation set randomly. Analysis of three probes of the Monte Carlo optimization with three random splits was done. Results from three random splits displayed robust, very simple, predictable, and reliable models for training, invisible training, calibration, and validation set with the correlation coefficient (R 2 ) of 0.8142–0.8244, 0.8244–0.8699, 0.8125–0.8627 and 0.8290–0.8686 respectively. As a result, the obtained models help to identify the hybrid descriptors for the increase and the decrease of anticancer activity of chalcones against MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines.

However, their efficacy for cancer therapy is reduced partially because of the serum-instability and incomplete drug release. In this study, a novel disulfide cross-linked liposomes (CLs) assembled from dimeric lipoic acid-derived glycerophosphorylcholine (di-LA-PC) conjugate was developed. The conjugate was synthesized by a facial esterification of lipoic acid (LA) and glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC) and characterized by MS, 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR. Featuring the enhanced serum-stability and intracellular drug release determined by in vitro stability and GSH-responsive behavior, CLs prepared with dried thin film technique following 10 % dithiothreitol (DTT) cross-linking can attain effective delivery of anticancer candidates. Notably, CLs stably encapsulated doxorubicin (Dox) in their vesicular structures and showed a remarkable thiol-sensitive release of payload upon cellular uptake by cancer cells, compared to that of uncross-linked liposomes (uCLs) or Doxil-like liposome (DLLs). The cell viability and apoptosis of Dox-loaded CLs worked the pronounced cytotoxic effects to MCF-7 cells with an IC 50 value of 10.8 μg Dox equiv./mL comparable to free Dox and 2.8-fold higher than DLLs. More importantly, it is demonstrated that the nanoscale characteristics of Dox-loaded CLs could prevent the proliferation of adriamycin-resistant MCF-7/ADR cell line, highlighting their potential in reversal of drug resistance. Furthermore, the preliminary in vivo test (n = 3) showed that disulfide cross-linked liposomal formulation of Dox (Dox-CLs) improved the therapeutic efficacy compared to free Dox and DLLs in a human breast carcinoma xenograft mouse model.

Since targeting excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1) may be a viable strategy to reestablish the therapeutic sensitivity to platinum-based agents in chemoresistant cases, and low ERCC1 level is beneficial to metastatic lung cancer patients undergoing platinum-based chemotherapy, we hypothesized that metastasis-associated process is involved in ERCC1-dependent cisplatin-resistance in lung adenocarcinoma. Methods: We performed an RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis to identify differentially expressed genes in ERCC1-deficient cells co-treated with cisplatin and sodium glycididazole (CMNa). Differentially expressed genes and the hub genes in the cisplatin/CMNa-treated cells were identified by systematic network analysis. Oncomine expression analysis was also performed to evaluate the clinical implication of the identified hub gene. Results: Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF/PDGFR) and focal adhesion genes were downregulated in ERCC1-defective non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells undergoing combined cisplatin/CMNa treatment. Consistent with the finding, cell migration was reduced in these cells. PDGFRB was identified as the hub gene in the process by differential expressed gene network analysis. Importantly, elevated PDGFRB level was observed in advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with metastases. Conclusion: PDGF/PDGFR and focal adhesion signaling may serve as another mechanism in addition to ERCC1-mediated cisplatin-resistance in lung adenocarcinoma. Multiple pro-invasion/pro-migration/proliferation and DNA damage repair pathways may be integrated to confer growth advantages on tumor cells. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Chemotherapy; Cisplatin; CMNa; Drug resistance; ERCC1; Focal adhesion pathways; PDGF/PDGFR pathway; RNA-Seq",Article,Scopus

Cetuximab (CTX), an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, is co-administered with afatinib to improve efficacy. Unfortunately, dose-related adverse reactions caused by combination therapy have affected patient compliance, and have resulted in treatment discontinuation in severe cases. In the present study, afatinib was encapsulated in “liposomes” (LPs) to achieve longer circulation in the blood and an enhanced permeability-and-retention effect in tumors. Concomitantly, CTX was designed to bind to drug-loaded LPs to form “immuno-LPs” for tumor-cell selectivity and therapeutic activity. In vitro, the cellular internalization rate of immuno-LPs was significantly higher than that of LPs (p < 0.05). In vivo, a markedly increased area under the curve and prolonged terminal half-life were detected in rats injected with the two LP formulations, indicating that LP encapsulation protected afatinib from binding to hemoglobin to control the risk of idiosyncratic drug reactions. Compared with free afatinib and LPs, immuno-LPs exhibited strongly enhanced drug delivery and antitumor efficacy in an NSCLC xenograft model, with stronger tumor selectivity and potentially fewer side-effects.

The in vivo study was carried out for the evaluation of tumor incidence, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1α, lipid peroxidation values, glutathione content and catalase activity in mice. The optimized binary ethosomes formulation presented sealed unilamellar shaped vesicles, with vesicles size, entrapment efficiency and flux of 99.89 ± 3.24 nm, 89.23 ± 2.13% and 1.01 ± 0.03 µg/cm 2 /h respectively. The confocal images of rat skin clearly illustrated the deeper penetration of rhodamine B loaded binary ethosomes formulation. Further, the binary ethosomes gel treated rat skin showed substantial increase in C Skin max and AUC 0-8 in comparison to rat skin treated with conventional gel. In vivo study revealed that the mice pre-treated with fisetin binary ethosomes gel caused marked decrease in the levels of TNF-α and IL-1α as compared to the mice exposed to UV only. Further the binary ethosomes gel treated mice group had demonstrated less percentage of tumour incidences (49%) as compared to mice treated with UV only (96% tumour incidence). The novelty of the work lies in successful optimization of formulation using Box-Behnken design and characterization of binary ethosomes carrier of fisetin and demonstration of improved dermal delivery of the same.

Although effective inhibition of various tumor cells was reported in vitro, combination treatment requires improvement in vivo due to uncontrolled ratiometric delivery. In this study, a tumor-targeting lipodisk nanoparticle formulation was developed for ratiometric loading and the transportation of two hydrophobic model drugs, doxorubicin (DOX) and paclitaxel (PTX), in one single platform. Furthermore, a slightly acidic pH-sensitive peptide (SAPSP) incorporated into lipodisks effectively enhanced the tumor-targeting and cell internalization. The obtained co-loaded lipodisks were approximately 30 nm with a pH-sensitive property. The ratiometric co-delivery of two drugs via lipodisks was confirmed in both the drug-resistant MCF-7/ADR cell line and its parental MCF-7 cell line in vitro, as well as in a tumor-bearing mouse model in vivo compared with a cocktail solution of free drugs. Co-loaded lipodisks exerted improved cytotoxicity to tumor cells in culture, particularly to drug-resistant tumor cells at synergistic drug ratios. In an in vivo xenograft mouse model, the anti-tumor ability of co-loaded lipodisks was evidenced by the remarkable inhibitory effect on tumor growth of either MCF-7 or MCF-7/ADR tumors, which may be attributed to the increased and ratiometric accumulation of both drugs in the tumor tissues. Therefore, tumor-specific lipodisks were crucial for the combination treatment of DOX and PTX to completely exert a synergistic anti-cancer effect. It is concluded that for co-loaded lipodisks, cytotoxicity data in vitro could be used to predict their inhibitory activity in vivo, potentially enhancing the clinical outcome of synergistic therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Co-loaded lipodisk; Combination therapy; Doxorubicin; Drug resistance; Paclitaxel; Synergistic anticancer effect; Tumor-targeted ratiometric drug delivery",Article,Scopus

In this report, we provide a detailed account of Thioflavin T (ThT) interacting with a promoter gene (c-Myc) which has relevance in several types of human cancers. Using a variety of spectroscopic techniques, we have shown that the binding of ThT is selective to c-Myc G-quadruplex only, having poor interactions with the duplex DNA sequences. UV–Visible titration experiments show that binding involves stacking interactions which were further corroborated by CD experiments. Fluorescence studies showed that the binding of ThT to c-Myc G-quadruplex results in a large increase in the fluorescence emission spectrum of c-Myc G-quadruplex while the same to duplex DNAs was much poor. Binding of ThT to c-Myc G-quadruplex results in thermal stabilization of the quadruplex DNA by up to 7.4 °C and Job plot experiments demonstrated the presence of 1:1 and 2:1 ligand to quadruplex complexes. Finally, the docking study suggested that ThT stacks with the guanine bases in one of the grooves which is in agreement with the CD studies.

In this study, an analytical method using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and high resolution gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC-HRMS) was developed to measure dioxins and chlorinated derivatives from triclosan in the presence of active chlorine in seawater matrix. Formation yields of dioxins and chlorinated triclosans were assessed at different initial precursor concentrations under dark and UV light irradiation conditions. Results showed that triclosan was rapidly transformed to its chlorinated derivatives, i.e. tetraclosans and pentaclosans, of which the formation yields peaked after 1 h of reaction. UV light was the key factor to promote the formation of dioxins. With the same initial triclosan/active chlorine ratio, the highest yield of dioxins was observed with lower initial concentrations of triclosan under UV irradiation.

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors are an effective treatment in preclinical models and patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-translocated cancers. Four anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors (crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, and brigatinib) have recently been approved. Post-marketing studies provided additional pharmacokinetic information on their pharmacokinetic parameters. The pharmacokinetic properties of approved anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors have been reviewed herein. Findings from additional studies on the effects of drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, and drug–drug interactions have been incorporated. Crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib reach their maximum plasma concentrations after approximately 6 h and brigatinib after 1–4 h. These drugs are primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A with other cytochrome P450 enzymes. They are mainly excreted in the feces, with only a minor fraction being eliminated in urine. Crizotinib, ceritinib, and brigatinib are substrates for the adenosine triphosphate binding-cassette transporter B1, whereas alectinib is not. The different substrate specificities of the transporters play a key role in superior blood–brain barrier penetration by alectinib than by crizotinib and ceritinib. Although the absorption, distribution, and excretion of anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors are regulated by drug transporters, their transporter-mediated pharmacokinetics have not yet been elucidated in detail in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Further research to analyze the contribution of drug transporters to the pharmacokinetics of anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer will be helpful for understanding the mechanisms of the inter-individual differences in the pharmacokinetics of anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",,Review,Scopus

The recommended dose of dabrafenib is 150 mg twice daily (bid) under fasted conditions. After single oral administration of the recommended dose, the absolute oral bioavailability (F) of dabrafenib is 95%. Dabrafenib shows a time-dependent increase in apparent clearance (CL/F) following multiple doses, which is likely due to induction of its own metabolism through cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Therefore, steady state is reached only after 14 days of daily dose administration. Moreover, the extent of this auto-induction process is dependent on the dose, which explains why dabrafenib systemic exposure at steady state increases less than dose proportionally over the dose range of 75–300 mg bid. The main elimination route of dabrafenib is the oxidative metabolism via CYP3A4/2C8 and biliary excretion. Among the three major metabolites identified, hydroxy-dabrafenib appears to contribute to the pharmacological activity. Age, sex and body weight did not have any clinically significant influence on plasma exposure to dabrafenib. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild renal or hepatic impairment, whereas the impacts of severe impairment on dabrafenib pharmacokinetics remain unknown.

Several methods are proposed to tackle the singularity problem, however there are still limitations and gaps. We consider a Bayesian framework to derive a statistic for testing a linear hypothesis on the GCM. Extensive simulations are performed to investigate performance and establish optimality characteristics. We show that the test overcomes the challenge of high-dimensionality and possesses all the desirable optimality characteristics of a good test - it is unbiased, symmetric and monotone with respect to sample size and departure from the null hypotheses. The results also indicate that the test performs very well, possessing a level close to the nominal value and high power in rejecting small departures from the null. The results also show that the test overcomes limitations of a previously proposed test. We illustrated practical applications using a publicly available time course genetic data on breast cancer, where we used our test statistic for gene filtering. The genes were ranked according to the value of the test statistic and the top five genes were annotated. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bayesian methods; gene filtering; Growth curve model; high-dimensional data; longitudinal analysis; time course genetic data",Article,Scopus

Here, we developed an advanced cell-SELEX strategy featuring functionalized graphene oxide (GO) and isothermal rolling circle amplification (RCA) to select aptamers against a prevailing foodborne pathogen, Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) and chitosan (CTS) were grafted onto the sheet-like GO molecules to synthesize a PC-GO material. TEM and FT-IR characterization demonstrated that the PC-GO composites were near-nanometric scale and tethered with PEG and CTS moieties, a property that significantly improved its solubility in biological buffer solutions used in cell-SELEX process. PC-GO could bind with ssDNAs with lower affinities to target cells, therefore the selection efficiency is greatly enhanced. The cell-binding aptamer candidates (CACs) were amplified by 107 fold using complementary ring mediated (CRM-RCA), a created amplification method that generate single-stranded products, which could be directly used in the next round selection. As fueled by PC-GO and CRM-RCA, four highly specific aptamers with lowest Kd value of 10.3 ± 2.5 nM were obtained. Flow cytometry analysis showed that all the four aptamers exhibited more than 75% binding affinity to V. parahaemolyticus than to other foodborne bacteria (less than 18%). Simple procedure, high efficiency, and free from expensive thermal cycler (required by PCR amplification) will enable the established strategy to find its applications in aptamer selecting against fungi, stem and cancerous cells as well. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Aptamer; Cell-SELEX; Graphene oxide; Isothermal amplification",Article,Scopus

Anti-tumor immune responses place cancer cells under selective pressure to lose or downregulate target antigens; therefore, vaccination against virus- or host- “driver” oncogenes are proposed as a strategy to overcome immune escape. Herein, we demonstrate the impact of immunogenic viral antigens on anti-tumor response and immune editing in MOC2-E6E7, a syngeneic murine oral cancer cell line expressing HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins. Using orthotopic syngeneic models, we observed in vivo tumor growth kinetics of MOC2-E6E7 is delayed in immunocompetent mice compared to parental MOC2 tumors. In contrast, tumor growth remained similar in Rag1 -/- mice lacking adaptive immunity. MOC2-E6E7 tumors demonstrated an “inflamed” or immune-activated tumor microenvironment and greater infiltration of CD8 + T cells compared to MOC2. By real-time PCR, we detected downregulation of E6 and E7 genes in MOC2-E6E7 tumors only in immunocompetent mice, suggesting the loss of ectopic viral antigen expression due to immune editing. We then assessed the efficacy of a biomaterials-based mesoporous silica rod (MSR) cancer vaccine targeting HPV-16 E7 in our model. Vaccination induced robust infiltration of antigen-specific CD8 +  T cells, which led to tumor growth delay and modestly prolonged survival in MOC2-E6E7 tumors. Increased efficacy was seen in a separate head and neck cancer tumor model, mEER, which obligately expresses E7 antigen. Collectively, our data highlight the need for both immunogenicity and ‘driver’ status of target antigens to be considered in cancer vaccine design. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","biomaterials; cancer vaccine; head and neck cancer; HPV16 E6 and E7; Immune editing; immunotherapy; mesoporous silica rods",Article,Scopus

Declining T cell function with aging in response to infection and vaccination is well documented, however little is known about aged T cell responses to tumor antigens during cancer progression or how these responses are modulated by standard chemotherapy. We examined T cell responses to cancer in aged mice using AE17sOVA mesothelioma in which ovalbumin (OVA) becomes a ‘spy’ tumor antigen containing one dominant (SIINFEKL) and two subdominant (KVVRFDKL and NAIVFKGL) epitopes. Faster progressing tumors in elderly (22–24 months, cf. 60–70 human years) relative to young (2–3 months, human 15–18 years) mice were associated with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and worsened cancer cachexia. Pentamer staining and an in-vivo cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) assay showed that whilst elderly mice generated a greater number of CD8 + T cells recognizing all epitopes, they exhibited a profound loss of function in their ability to lyse targets expressing the dominant, but not subdominant, epitopes compared to young mice. Chemotherapy was less effective and more toxic in elderly mice however, similar to young mice, chemotherapy expanded CTLs recognizing at least one subdominant epitope in tumors and draining lymph nodes, yet treatment efficacy still required CD8 + T cells. Given the significant dysfunction associated with elderly CTLs recognizing dominant epitopes, our data suggest that responses to subdominant tumor epitopes may become important when elderly hosts with cancer are treated with chemotherapy. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Telomerase is overexpressed in most cancers, but also expressed in some normal cells, raising safety concerns. We hypothesize that ACT with T-helper cell receptors may overcome tumour tolerance, mobilize host immune cells and induce epitope spreading, with limited toxicity. From long term survivors after cancer vaccination, we have isolated telomerase-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) from T-helper cells. Herein, we report the development of transient retargeting of T cells with mRNA-based TCRs. This strategy allows for safer clinical testing and meaningful dose escalation. DP4 is the most common HLA molecule. We cloned two telomerase-specific, DP4-restricted TCRs into the mRNA expression vector pCIpA102, together with the sorter/marker/suicide gene RQR8. Donor T cells were electroporated with mRNA encoding TCR_RQR8. The results showed that both TCR_RQR8 constructs were expressed in >90% of T cells. The transfected T cells specifically recognized the relevant peptide, as well as naturally processed epitopes from a 177aa telomerase protein fragment, and remained functional for six days. A polyfunctional and Th1-like cytokine profile was observed. The TCRs were functional in both CD4+and CD8+recipient T cells, even though DP4-restricted. The findings demonstrate that the cloned TCRs confer recipient T cells with the desired telomerase-specificity and functionality. Preclinical experiments may provide limited information on the efficacy and toxicity of T-helper TCRs, as these mobilize the host immune system. We therefore intend to use the mRNA-based TCRs for a first-in-man trial. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","adoptive cell therapy; cancer; DP4; immunotherapy; long-term survivor; mRNA; retargeted T cell; T cell receptor; T-helper cell; telomerase",Article,Scopus

Thus, we studied a prospective cohort of mNSCLC (n = 61) treated in second or third-line with nivolumab. We analyzed various blood myeloid and lymphoid markers by flow cytometry (176 variables) at baseline, and after 15 and 30 days of therapy. By attempting to link the evolution of peripheral lymphoid, myeloid cells and anti-PD-1 response, we observed that accumulation of lymphoid cells and monocytic MDSC (mMDSC) expressing, respectively, Tim-3 and galectin-9 is implicated in resistance to PD-1 blockade both for patients with primary or acquired secondary resistance to anti-PD-1. In vitro, anti-Tim-3 blocking antibody reverses resistance to anti-PD-1 in PBMC from lung cancer patients and high levels of blood mMDSC negatively impact on anti-PD-1 efficacy. Together, these data underline that the galectin-9/Tim-3 pathway and mMDSC are key mechanisms of primary or secondary resistance to anti-PD-1 and could be a new target for immunotherapy drug combinations. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

To this aim, in recent trials, patients were vaccinated with pools of synthetic long peptides (SLP) (15–30 aa long) composed of a potential class I epitope(s) elongated at both ends with native antigen sequences to also provide a potential class II epitope(s). Using MELOE-1 as a model antigen, we present an alternative strategy consisting in linking selected class I and class II epitopes with an artificial cathepsin-sensitive linker to improve epitope processing and presentation by DC. We provide evidence that some linker sequences used in our artificial SLPs (aSLPs) could increase up to 100-fold the cross-presentation of class I epitopes to CD8-specific T cell clones when compared to cross-presentation of the corresponding native long peptide. Presentation of class II epitopes were only slightly increased. We confirmed this increased cross-presentation after in vitro stimulation of PBMC from healthy donors with aSLP and assessment of CD8-specific responses and also in vivo following aSLP vaccination of HLA*A0201/HLA-DRB0101 transgenic mice. Finally, we provide some evidence that vaccination with aSLP could inhibit the growth of transplanted tumors in mice. Our data thus support the use of such aSLPs in future cancer vaccination trials to improve anti-tumor CD8 T cell responses and therapeutic efficacy. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

We performed a meta-analysis to investigate whether age differences play a role in cancer immunotherapy efficacy based on a large amount of clinical data. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase and MEDLINE for relevant randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was secondary outcome. The interaction test was used to assess the heterogeneity of HR between younger and older groups. Results: In total, 19 clinical randomized trials involving 11157 patients were included. The pooled HR for OS was 0.73 (95% CI 0.69–0.78) and 0.63 (95% CI 0.52–0.73) for PFS in younger patients receiving ICIs treatments, when compared with younger patients treated with controls. For older patients treated with ICIs, the pooled HR for OS compared with controls was 0.64 (95% CI 0.59–0.69) and 0.66 (95% CI 0.58–0.74) for PFS. The difference on OS efficacy between younger and older patients treated with ICIs was significant (P heterogeneity  = 0.025). Conclusions: Immune checkpoint inhibitors significantly improved OS and PFS in both younger and older patients compared with controls, but the magnitude of benefit was clinically age-dependent. Patients ≥65 y can benefit more from immunotherapy than younger patients. Future research should take age difference into consideration in trials and focus on tolerance and toxicity of ICIs in older patients. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","age; Immune checkpoint inhibitor; immunosenescence; overall survival; progression-free survival",Article,Scopus

In cancer, suppressive immune checkpoints are often hyper-activated to ensure an effective evasion of tumor cells from immune surveillance. These immune checkpoints include in part, the B7/butyrophilin-like receptors such as butyrophilin sub-family 3A/CD277 receptors (BTN3A), the B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) belonging to the B7-like receptors and the programmed death protein (PD-1) with its ligand PD-L1. We evaluated the plasma level of these markers in 32 PDAC patients (learning cohort) by ad hoc developed ELISA’s and showed that there are highly correlated. We used ROC curves and univariate analysis to characterize their prognostic relevance in these patients and showed that their plasma level can serve as survival predictor. Plasma level thresholds that correlate with less than six months survival were established for sPD-1 (>8.6 ng/ml), sPD-L1 (>0.36 ng/ml), sBTLA (>1.91 ng/ml), sBTN3A1 (>6.98 ng/ml) and pan-sBTN3A (>6.92 ng/ml). These thresholds were applied in independent validation cohort composed by 27 new samples and could efficiently discriminate short versus long PDAC survivors.

However, the partial objective response highlights a crucial need for relevant, easily evaluable, predictive biomarkers. Here we explore whether in situ assessment of Tbet+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) reflects a pre-existing functional antitumor Th1/Tc1/IFNγ response, in relation with clinicopathological features, microsatellite status and expression of immunoregulatory molecules (PD1, PDL1, IDO-1). Methodology: In two independent cohorts of CRC (retrospective n = 80; prospective n = 27) we assessed TILs density (CD3, Tbet, PD1) and expression profile of PDL1 and IDO-1 by immunohistochemistry/image analysis. Furthermore, the prospective cohort allowed to perform ex vivo CRC explant cultures and measure by Elisa the IFNγ response, at baseline and upon anti-PD1 treatment. Results: The density of Tbet+ TILs was significantly higher in MSI CRC, especially in the medullary subtype but also in a subgroup of MSS (microsatellite stable), and positively correlated with PD1 and PDL1 expression, but not with IDO-1. Finally, a high number of Tbet+ TILs was associated with a favorable overall survival. These Tbet+ TILs were functional as their density positively correlated with basal IFNγ levels. In addition, the combined score of Tbet+ PD1+ TILs coupled with IDO-1 expression predicted the magnitude of the IFNγ response upon anti-PD1. Conclusion: Altogether, immunohistochemical quantification of Tbet+ TILs is a reliable and accurate tool to recapitulate a preexisting Th1/Tc1/IFNγ antitumor response that can be reinvigorated by anti-PD1 treatment. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

In human lung cancer, we have identified a unique microRNA (miR)-based pathway employed by tumor cells to repress detection by immune cells via the NKG2D-MICA/B receptor-ligand system. MICA/B is readily induced by cell transformation and serves as a danger signal and ligand to alert NK and activated CD8 + T cells. However, immunohistochemical analysis indicated that human lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma specimens express little MICA/B while high levels of miR-183 were detected in both tumor types in a TCGA database. Human lung tumor cell lines confirmed the reverse relationship in expression of MICA/B and miR-183. Importantly, a miR-183 binding site was identified on the 3ʹuntranslated region (UTR) of both MICA and MICB, suggesting its role in MICA/B regulation. Luciferase reporter constructs bearing the 3ʹUTR of MICA or MICB in 293 cells supported the function of miR-183 in repressing MICA/B expression. Additionally, anti-sense miR-183 transfection into H1355 or H1299 tumor cells caused the upregulation of MICA/B. Abundant miR-183 expression in tumor cells was traced to transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ), as evidenced by antisense TGFβ transfection into H1355 or H1299 tumor cells which subsequently lost miR-183 expression accompanied by MICA/B upregulation. Most significantly, anti-sense miR-183 transfected tumor cells became more sensitive to lysis by activated CD8 + T cells that express high levels of NKG2D. Thus, high miR-183 triggered by TGFβ expressed in lung tumor cells can target MICA/B expression to circumvent detection by NKG2D on immune cells. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Immune evasion; mirR-183; NK cells; NKG2D-MICA/B; non-small cell lung cancer; T cells",Article,Scopus

Tumor cell-intrinsic activation of the RNA receptor retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) can trigger an immunogenic form of programmed tumor cell death, but its impact on antitumor responses remains largely unexplored. We show that activation of intrinsic RIG-I signaling induces melanoma cell death that enforces cross-presentation of tumor-associated antigens by bystander dendritic cells. This results in systemic expansion and activation of tumor-antigen specific T cells in vivo with subsequent regression of pre-established melanoma. These processes were dependent on the signaling hub MAVS and type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in the host cell. Using melanoma cells deficient for the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7, we demonstrate that RIG-I-activated tumor cells used as a vaccine are a relevant source of IFN-I during T cell cross-priming in vivo.

Several lines of evidence suggest that antibiotic (ATB) usage prior to or within the first month of ICI initiation negatively impacts clinical outcomes. Methods: We examined patients with advanced melanoma treated with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or an anti-CTLA-4 mAb alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Those receiving ATB within 30 days of beginning ICI were compared with those who did not receive ATB. Response rates as determined by RECIST 1.1, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and immune-related toxicities were assessed. Results: Of these 74 patients analyzed, a total of 10 patients received ATB (13.5%) within 30 days of initiation of ICI. Patients who received ATB 30 days prior to the administration of ICI experienced more primary resistance (progressive disease) (0% of the objective response rate compared to 34%), and progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly shorter (2.4 vs 7.3 months, HR 0.28, 95% CI (0.10–0.76) p = 0.01). Overall survival (OS) was also shorter; however, this was not statistically significant (10.7 vs 18.3 months, HR:0.52, 95% CI (0.21–1.32) p = 0.17). The multivariate analysis further supported that ATB administration was associated with worse PFS (HR 0.32 (0.13–0.83) 95% CI, p = 0.02). Conclusion: These findings suggest that ATB use within 30 days prior to ICI initiation in patients with advanced melanoma may adversely affect patient outcomes. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","antibiotics; dysbiosis; gut microbiome; immune check-point inhibition; immunotherapy; Melanoma",Article,Scopus

In CLL, specific functional alterations have been described in circulating CD8 + T cells, yet a global view of the CD8 + T cell compartment phenotype and of its real impact on disease progression is presently elusive. We developed a multidimensional statistical analysis of CD8 + T cell phenotypic marker expression based on whole blood multi-color flow-cytometry. The analysis comprises both unsupervised statistics (hClust and PCA) and supervised classification methods (Random forest, Adaboost algorithm, Decision tree learning and logistic regression) and allows to cluster patients by comparing multiple phenotypic markers expressed by CD8 + T cells. Our results reveal a global CD8 + T cell phenotypic signature in CLL patients that is significantly modified when compared to healthy donors. We also uncover a CD8 + T cell signature characteristic of patients evolving toward therapy within 6 months after phenotyping. The unbiased, not predetermined and multimodal approach highlights a prominent role of the memory compartment in the prognostic signature. The analysis also reveals that imbalance of the central/effector memory compartment in CD8 + T cells can occur irrespectively of the elapsed time after diagnosis. Taken together our results indicate that, in CLL patients, CD8 + T cell phenotype is imprinted by disease clinical progression and reveal that CD8 + T cell memory compartment alteration is not only a hallmark of CLL disease but also a signature of disease evolution toward the need for therapy. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

In our previous study, we found that estrogen receptors (ERs) have a close connection with NLRs in the inflammatory response. Here, ERs are first identified as NLRs transcription regulation factors, both regulate NLRs expression and promote inflammasome co-localization. Furthermore, we identified that NLRP3 was differentially expressed in colon normal and cancer cells, selective ERα antagonist could significantly decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines expression, suppress proliferation and promote apoptosis by inhibited NLRP3 expression and inflammasome activity. In short, the research demonstrates that ERs participate in the NLR-associated signaling pathway in cancer by directly regulating NLRs.

Due to late diagnosis, most CRC patients missed the proper timing for radical operation, which led to the high mortality in CRC. Therefore, identifying new prognostic and therapeutic targets is important. Long non-coding RNAs are reported as essential regulators for tumor progression, including in CRC. LncRNA SUMO1P3 has been documented as an oncogene promoting proliferation, cell cycle, and metastasis in several cancers, but its role in CRC has never been unveiled. The purpose of our study is to interrogate the functions and mechanism of SUMO1P3 in colorectal cancer. We validated the upregulation and the prognostic significance of SUMO1P3 in CRC. The loss-of-function assays suggested that SUMO1P3 provoked CRC cell proliferative ability, and retarded apoptotic ability. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 3 (CPEB3) has been newly acknowledged as a tumor suppressive gene in several cancers, and has been revealed to present low expression in CRC. We predicted through UCSC database and validated by ChIP assay that EZH2, a crucial regulator of trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), bound to CPEB3 promoter. Further, we validated that SUMO1P3 epigenetically repressed CPEB3 through EZH2. Finally, rescue assays indicated that SUMO1P3 provoked proliferation, cell cycle, and retarded apoptosis through CPEB3. Consequently, current study showed that lncRNA SUMO1P3 promoted cell proliferative ability and inhibited apoptotic ability in CRC by epigenetically silencing CPEB3, providing a novel prognostic marker for CRC patients. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Colorectal cancer; CPEB3; EZH2; SUMO1P3",Article,Scopus

We revealed that FOXO1 directly inhibits Nampt expression via binding to FOXO1 binding domains in the 5′-flanking region of the nampt gene. Nampt expression was increased by insulin and downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, which was inhibited by FOXO1 overexpression.

This approach aims to restore down-regulated miRNAs using synthetic miRNA mimics. However, it remains a critical issue that miRNA mimics are unstable and transient in cells. Here, we first show that miRNA mimics are rapidly degraded by a mechanism different from Tudor-staphylococcal/micrococcal-like nuclease (TSN)-mediated miRNA decay, which degrades endogenous miRNAs, and newly identified 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L as key factors responsible for the degradation of miRNA mimics in human cells. Our results suggest that the OAS1 recognizes miRNA mimics and produces 2′-5′-oligoadenylates (2–5A), which leads to the activation of latent endoribonuclease RNase L to degrade miRNA mimics. A small-molecule inhibitor that blocks RNase L can stabilize miRNA mimics. These findings provide a promising method for the stabilization of miRNA mimics, as well as for the efficient miRNA replacement therapy. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Curcumin; miRNA mimics; Oligoadenylate synthetase; RNase L",Article,Scopus

However, the molecular mechanism and regulatory purpose of SMDT1 remain largely unexplored, especially no study was reported in cancer. Here, we firstly reported that how SMDT1 exerted its role through mediating mitochondrial dynamic in PDAC malignancy. In this study, by screening online of subunit of MCU complex, we confirmed that SMDT1 expression was significantly positive correlated with PDAC prognosis. The GEO datasets showed decreased SMDT1 expression in PDAC tumor compared with non-tumor tissues. SMDT1 overexpression could notably inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis. Further analysis demonstrated that up-regulated SMDT1 in ASPC1 and Canpan1 cells led to increased accumulation of pro apoptotic protein BAX and decrease in anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bclx. And more releasing of cytochrome c located in cytosolic. Mechanistically, in the morphological analysis of mitochondria, more fragmented mitochondria were presented in SMDT1 overexpression cells by promting the phosphorylation of Drp1, increasing Fis and decreasing MFN1. Meanwhile, more Drp1 was translocated on the mitochondrial from the cytoplasm in up-regulated SMDT1 cells. On the basis of the evidence above we deduce that SMDT1-driven change in mitochondrial dynamics mediated cells apoptosis in PDAC.

Wild-type MV evolved to counter the innate immune system by avoiding both type I interferon (IFN) induction and inhibiting IFN signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway. However, virus replication is significantly inhibited in IFN-pretreated cells. Similarly, MV vaccine derived strains are inhibited by IFN pretreatment, but vaccine strains also induce IFN. Despite the significant progress in understanding the interactions between MV and the IFN pathway, the IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) that inhibit MV replication remain largely unknown. The aim of this study is to identify specific ISGs that mediate restriction of MV. In this study, we report that Radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2 (RSAD2) restricts MV infection at the stage of virus release in infected 293T cells. Furthermore, attenuated MV strains are currently being developed as a novel treatment for solid and hematological malignancies. Therefore, we tested the impact of RSAD2 expression in an oncolytic virotherapy context using a MV permissive ovarian cancer line (SR-B2). As measured in 293T cells, MV release was also impaired in SR-B2 cells transduced to express RSAD2 in vitro. Additionally, oncolytic MV therapeutic efficacy was impaired in SR-B2 cells transduced to express RSAD2 in vivo. Overall, we identify RSAD2 as a novel restriction factor for MV by inhibiting the release of virus. These results provide important information regarding the interaction between MV and the innate immune system, as well as implications for the design of oncolytic MV platforms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Antiviral; Interferon; Interferon stimulated genes; Measles; RSAD2; VIPERIN",Article,Scopus

In such studies, cancer-specific mortality or survival is frequently used as the primary outcome. To determine whether a putative cancer was part of the causal chain of events leading to death, cancer registries primarily rely on death certificates. Hence, they depend on the subjective interpretation of information available to medical examiners at the time of death. Misclassification may occur: studies report misclassification of cancer as a cause of death in 15%–35% of death certificates based on evaluation by expert panels and/or autopsy reports. Further misclassification may occur when coding death causes in the cancer registry. Researchers should be aware of potential misclassification bias when using cancer registry data. Differential misclassification may bias the results towards or away from the null hypothesis, depending on whether there is relative over- or under-reporting of cancer-related deaths in one group. Strategies to improve reporting of cancer-specific survival/mortality include (1) describing the procedure used to identify cancer-specific deaths; (2) considering the use of multiple definitions of cancer-related deaths (strict/liberal definitions of cancer-specific deaths, and/or addition of relative survival as an outcome); and (3) reporting cancer-specific survival/mortality together with the objectively measured parameters overall survival or all-cause mortality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","All-cause mortality; Cancer registries; Cancer-specific mortality; Cancer-specific survival; Overall survival; US SEER database",Note,Scopus

Projecting the future burden of cancer in Canada is essential for health planning and evaluation. We aimed to estimate the future incidence of cancer in Canada to 2042. Methods: Age-sex-region-specific cancer incidence data were obtained for the years 1983-2012 and cancer incidence was projected from 2013 to 2042 for the top five cancer sites. The modelling algorithm combined a mixture of cancer projection methods to select the best-fitted model. When the chosen model produced by the modelling algorithm resulted in estimates that were not consistent with expert opinion, an alternate model was selected that took into consideration historical changes in policy, screening and lifestyle behaviours. Incidence projections were made for Canada and its provinces. Results: Lung cancer incidence is estimated to rise to 14,866 cases in men and 19,162 in women in 2042. Colorectal cancer incidence is estimated to rise to 28,146 in men and 21,102 in women. Cases of bladder cancer are projected to rise to 10,708 and 3,364 in men and women, respectively. Breast cancer incidence is predicted to rise to 40,712 and prostate cancer incidence is projected to rise to 92,949. Conclusion: These cancer incidence projections up to 2042 can be used for planning cancer control strategies and prevention programs. Given the ongoing changes in the prevalence of risk factors and in cancer prevention policies, these estimates should be interpreted with caution. © 2019 The Authors","Bladder cancer; Breast cancer; Canada, projections; Cancer; Colorectal cancer; Incidence; Lung cancer; Prostate cancer; Trends",Article,Scopus

Multivariate Cox hazard models adjusted for established cancer risk factors including smoking were analyzed for lung cancer incidence and cancer mortality among those who were diagnosed with lung cancer. Population attributable risks (PAR) of low CRF (<5 METs) were determined. Results: During 12.7 ± 7.5 years follow-up, 105 (2.1%) participants were diagnosed with lung cancer and 83 (79%) of those died from cancer after 3.6 ± 4.6 years from diagnosis. CRF was inversely and independently associated with cancer outcomes. A 1-MET increase and categories of moderate and high CRF were associated with 10%, 47% and 65% reduction in lung cancer incidence (p = 0.002), and 13%, 58% and 76% reduction in cancer mortality (p = 0.002), respectively. Also, individuals who were diagnosed with lung cancer and were at moderate or high CRF categories at baseline exhibited longer survival time (p < 0.001). The PARs% for lung cancer incidence and cancer mortality were 8.7% and 18.5%, respectively. Conclusions: Higher CRF is associated with lower lung cancer incidence in men. Among individuals who were diagnosed with lung cancer, higher CRF was associated with reduced cancer mortality and longer survival time. These results support the protective benefits of higher CRF in the prevention of lung cancer outcomes.

Cancer stem cells have been reported to be resistant to conventional treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy, which induce selective pressure on tumoral populations resulting in selection and growth of the resistant cells. Therefore, targeting the therapeutic aspects of cancer stem cells in bladder cancer may be promising. In this study, we briefly discuss the biology of bladder cancer and then address the possible relationship between molecular biology of bladder cancer and cancer stem cells. Subsequently, the mechanisms of resistance applied by cancer stem cells against the conventional therapeutic tools, especially chemotherapy, are discussed. Moreover, by emphasizing the biomarkers described for cancer stem cells in bladder cancer, we have provided, described, and proposed targets on cancer stem cells for therapeutic interventions and, finally, reviewed some immunotargeting strategies against bladder cancer stem cells. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cancer stem cells; drug resistance; immunotherapy; transitional cell carcinoma; urinary bladder neoplasms",Review,Scopus

In our results, we found KDM3A expression was significantly increased in colorectal cancer metastatic lesions compared with primary lesions, but had no statistical difference between colorectal cancer tissues and normal colorectal tissues. Moreover, high KDM3A expression was correlated with poor histological differentiation, and advanced clinical stage, N classification, M classification and short overall survival in colorectal cancer patients. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses indicated that high expression of KDM3A served as an independent unfavorable prognostic factor in colorectal cancer patients.

Although breast cancer has not been traditionally considered to be immunogenic, recently there is accumulating and solid evidence on the association between immune system and breast cancer. To mount an effective anti-tumor response, host immunosurveillance must recognize tumor-specific epitopes, thus defining the antigenicity of a tumor. Neoantigens are mutant cancer peptides that arise as terminal products of the expression of somatic cancer mutations. Neoantigens and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins present together to effector cells of the immune system. Neoantigen vaccines have shown promising results in inducing neoantigen-specific T-cell responses. Currently, cancer vaccines are under evaluation in breast cancer to avoid recurrences in patients at high risk despite optimal standard therapy. Given the promise of a very specific long-term antitumor immune response, the development of cancer vaccines continues is of great interest. Combinations of neoantigen vaccines and other immunotherapies are also studied to evade cancer immune escape. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,Scopus

We estimated the proportion of cancer cases and deaths that could be potentially avoided by eliminating or reducing lifestyle risk factors in Brazil. Methods: We obtained the distribution of lifestyle risk factors by sex and age groups from recent representative health surveys in Brazil; relative risks from pooled analyses of prospective studies and meta-analyses; and cancer cases and deaths in 2012 from GLOBOCAN. Results: We found that 26.5% (114,497 cases) of all cancer cases and 33.6% (63,371 deaths) of all cancer deaths could be potentially avoided by eliminating lifestyle risk factors in Brazil. Plausible reductions in these exposures based on policy targets and cancer prevention recommendations could have potentially avoided 4.5% (19,731 cases) and 6.1% (11,480 deaths) of all cancer cases and deaths, respectively. Tobacco smoking accounted for most of the preventable cancer cases and deaths, followed by high body mass index and alcohol consumption.

It is important to identify modifiable predictors in early life that may decrease cancer risks and mortality. The present study aims to investigate the relationship between aerobic fitness in adolescence and the subsequent risk of cancer and cancer-associated mortality. Methods: The study included 1 185 439 Swedish men born between 1950 and 1980 that participated in the military conscription (mean age = 18 years). The results from the aerobic fitness test (W max ) was linked to the risk of cancer and cancer-associated mortality during a 40-years’ follow-up using Cox proportional hazards models. A co-sibling design was employed to take familial factors into account. Results: During a mean follow-up of 27 years 15 093 cases of cancer and 4900 cancer-associated mortalities were registered. Higher W max (per additional 1 SD) was associated with a decreased risk of cancer at 40 years of follow-up (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.91–0.96 for cancer and HR 0.82 95% CI 0.76–0.87 for cancer-associated mortality) but not at 5 years of follow-up (HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.99–1.07; and HR 1.04; 95% CI 0.97–1.12). In the co-sibling model the protective effects of high W max were increased at 40 years of follow-up for cancer (HR 0.91; 95% CI 0.85–0.98) and cancer-associated mortality (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.68–0.89). Conclusions: These findings identify in late adolescence a potentially modifiable predictor of cancer, with higher aerobic fitness associated with a decreased risk of cancer incidence and mortality later in life. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aerobic fitness; Cancer; Cancer mortality; Cancer risk factors; Familial factors",Article,Scopus

Depression may also occur post treatment and may partially mediate the effects of cancer treatment on cognition. Additionally, physical activity has been shown to mitigate treatment effects on cognition and depression. This study examined the role of depression in mediating the effects of cancer treatment on cognitive function (perceived cognitive impairment, PCI; perceived cognitive ability, PCA) in breast cancer survivors and explored the role of physical activity in moderating these effects. Materials and methods: 317 breast cancer survivors were recruited via Army of Women. Participants were 40–75 years old and had stage 0 (in situ) to IIIc breast cancer and were less than 10 years post treatment. Participants completed a demographic and treatment questionnaire, as well as the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function, and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Results: Depressive symptoms significantly contributed to cognitive function in all models. Moderate and vigorous levels of physical activity moderated breast cancer treatment effects on depression and cognition. Chemotherapy, tamoxifen, and anastrozole all demonstrated negative effects on cognition. Conclusion: The results from this study support the importance of examining mediating factors in the effects of cancer treatment on cognition, particularly depression, following cancer treatment. Effects of treatment on cognition in breast cancer survivors are partially explained by changes in depressive symptoms, although chemotherapy may impact cognition independent of depression. Importantly, physical activity may reduce the risk of depression and cognitive impairment in breast cancer survivors. © 2019","Breast cancer; Cancer treatment; Cognition; Depression; Physical activity",Article,Scopus

We hypothesized that regional cancer mortality rates in Taiwan, an ethnically homogeneous society, exhibited no significant variations. Methods: We investigated the trends in Taiwan regional cancer mortality between 1992 and 2014. We analyzed regional age-standardized cancer mortality rates for lung, liver, colon, stomach, oral, breast, and prostate cancers using the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database and Demographic Database. Furthermore, we applied Joinpoint regression analysis to evaluate the trends across different regions. Results: There are clear regional variations in mortality rates for liver, stomach, and oral cancers, but not for lung, colon, breast, and prostate cancers. The regional death rates of oral cancer, especially for eastern Taiwan, not only elevate the fastest (APC = 14.78% per year, P < 0.001) but also show the largest disparities between men and women. Regional death rates for stomach cancer, which declined most rapidly, are converging in both general and gender groups. Liver cancer is the only one with regional variations whose trends do not all go in the same direction. We also demonstrated that northern Taiwan has significant regional advantages with respect to cancer mortality. Conclusions: Some but not all cancers in Taiwan show regional disparities.

However, the potential impact of aging on cancer microenvironment remains poorly understood. Here, we performed a pan-cancer transcriptome analysis to identify aging-specific molecular patterns across 18 cancer types. Strikingly, aging-specific molecular features define human cancers into two types, including the strong and weak aging-effect groups. Significant aging associated molecular signature was observed in 16 cancer types (strong aging-effect group) such as breast invasive carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia. In such 16 cancer types, old patients showed obvious poor survival compared to young patients, but this observation was not found in the weak aging-effect cancers. Aging-associated cancer-relevant molecules significantly enriched in 23 pathways including EMT and KRAS signaling. More interestingly, in cancer microenvironment, aging significantly restrains adaptive immunity, but strikingly, increases the number of infiltrated innate immune cells. Further analysis shows that the expression of immune checkpoints including PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2 and CTLA-4 are mostly correlated with age. In general, cancer cells in elderly patients show a more aggressive phenotype and their surrounding microenvironment is under a more immune suppression status compared to young patients. Our study provides a systematic understanding of aging-associated molecular features in pan-cancer and indicates a clinical requirement to develop aging-specific therapeutic strategies in a majority of cancer types. Furthermore, aging-altered immune cells and immune checkpoints should be considered in cancer immunotherapy. © 2018 UICC","aging; cancer; immune checkpoints; immunotherapy; PD-1",Article,Scopus

The first report established a causal association between smoking and lung cancer, and subsequent reports expanded the list of smoking-attributable causes of death to include other cancers, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and respiratory diseases. For a second level of causes of death, the current evidence is suggestive but not sufficient to infer a causal relationship with smoking. This study draws on 1980–2004 U.S. vital statistics data and applies a cause-specific version of the Preston-Glei-Wilmoth indirect method, which uses the association between lung cancer death rates and death rates for other causes of death to estimate the fraction and number of deaths attributable to smoking overall and by cause. Nearly all of the established and additional causes of death are positively associated with lung cancer mortality, suggesting that the additional causes are in fact attributable to smoking. I find 420,284 annual smoking-attributable deaths at ages 50+ for years 2000–2004, 14% of which are due to the additional causes. Results corroborate recent estimates of cause-specific smoking-attributable mortality using prospective cohort data that directly measure smoking status. The U.S. Surgeon General should reevaluate the evidence for the additional causes and consider reclassifying them as causally attributable to smoking. © 2019 The Author","Cause of death; Mortality; Smoking; United States; Vital statistics",Article,Scopus

Our objective was to describe tonsil cancer incidence trends in low SES regions, and compare observed trends with those for larynx cancer. Materials and methods: Age-adjusted incidence rates and trends for tonsil and larynx squamous cell carcinomas (2000–14) from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER 18) were evaluated using SEER*Stat and Joinpoint 4.5.0.1. Annual percentage changes (APCs) were compared between low and high SES counties. The laryngeal cancer cohort was included as a comparator reflecting a tobacco-related malignancy. Results: Tonsil cancer incidence trends increased at least as much in low SES as in high SES counties (APC/AAPC 4.4, 95%CI 2.4–6.4 versus APC/AAPC 2.9, 95%CI 2.4–3.3). Pairwise comparison confirmed no differences between incidence trends across SES quintiles for tonsil cancer incidence rates. In contrast, age-adjusted incidence rates of larynx cancer decreased in high SES counties (APC/AAPC −2.4, 95%CI −2.4 to −2.0, p < 0.001) and were stable in low SES counties (APC/AAPC −0.9, 95%CI −1.9 to 0.2, p = 0.10). Compared with larynx cancer patients, tonsil cancer patients in low SES regions were significantly more likely to be younger and white. Conclusion: In low SES US counties, tonsil cancer incidence rates increased from 2000 to 2014, while larynx cancer rates did not change, reflecting diverging trends for larynx and tonsil cancers. Tonsil cancer incidence rates are increasing in most US regions regardless of regional socioeconomic status.

Methods and results: PubMed was searched until November 2017 for observational studies investigating any type of PA in association with total mortality, breast cancer mortality and/or breast cancer recurrence among women with breast cancer diagnosis. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using random-effects models for highest versus lowest categories of PA. Ten studies were included in the meta-analysis. During an average follow-up ranging from 3.5 to 12.7 years there were 23,041 breast cancer survivors, 2,522 deaths from all causes, 841 deaths from breast cancer and 1,398 recurrences/remissions. Compared to women in the lowest recreational PA level (lowest quintile/quartile), women in the highest level had a lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.58, 95% CIs: 0.45–0.75; 8 studies), of death from breast cancer (HR = 0.60, 95% CIs 0.36–0.99; 5 studies) and a lower, albeit non-significant, risk of recurrence (HR = 0.79, 95% CIs 0.60–1.05; 5 studies). There was evidence of heterogeneity between the studies evaluating recreational PA and total mortality (Ι 2 = 52.4%) and even higher for breast cancer mortality (Ι 2 = 77.7%) or recurrence (Ι 2 = 66.4%). Conclusion: Highest recreational PA after breast cancer diagnosis was associated with lower all-cause and breast cancer mortality. This finding probably reflects the favorable impact of PA on cardiovascular mortality, and a possible favorable role on breast cancer survival, though reverse causation cannot be excluded. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Breast cancer; Breast cancer survivors; Meta-analysis; Physical activity; Survival; Systematic review",Article,Scopus

Our previous study showed PRSS23 is down-regulated obviously in Hedgehog pathway blocked gastric cancer cells. However, the correlation between PRSS23 and tumor progression of gastric cancer remains unclear. Here, the role and mechanism of PRSS23 in tumor progression of gastric cancer were determined. PRSS23 protein levels were significantly increased in gastric cancer tissues compared with the paired adjacent normal gastric mucosa tissues. The high expression of PRSS23 correlated strongly with both poor differentiated histology and cancer region of sinus ventriculi. Gastric cancer patients with low PRSS23 expression displayed a better prognosis. In gastric cancer cells, PRSS23 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. In xenograft tumor model, PRSS23 knockdown led to dramatic decreases of the average tumor volume and the average tumor weight. In addition, PRSS23 knockdown suppressed gastric cancer growth through inhibiting EIF2 signaling using gene expression microarray analysis. Taken together, our results suggest PRSS23 is highly associated with human gastric tumorigenesis and progression. PRSS23 knockdown could suppress tumor growth of gastric cancer in vitro and in vivo through inhibiting EIF2 signaling, and EIF4E maybe a potential target of PRSS23.

The poor response of pancreatic cancer to conventional therapeutics, especially against cancer stem cells (CSCs), is the primary obstacle to improving patient survival. Emerging evidence indicates that the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) RP11-567G11.1 is up-regulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and that its expression is associated with poor prognosis. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which RP11-567G11.1 influences survival in pancreatic cancer. Methods: We evaluated the expression of RP11-567G11.1 in pancreatic cancer tissues via in situ hybridization. We also constructed RP11-567G11.1 knockdown cell models and used CCK8 and flow cytometry to detect the function of this lncRNA. Western blotting and qPCR were used to detect the expression levels of factors related to RP11-567G11.1. Results: The results illustrated that RP11-567G11.1 was significantly up-regulated in poorly differentiated pancreatic cancer tissues as compared to its expression in non-tumor tissues. Additionally, depletion of RP11-567G11.1 in pancreatic cancer cells inhibited proliferation and cell cycle progression, induced apoptosis, suppressed the stem cell-like phenotype, and increased sensitivity to gemcitabine. Also depletion of RP11-567G11.1 in pancreatic cancer cells inhibited factors downstream of the NOTCH signaling pathway. Conclusion: RP11-567G11.1 plays a crucial role in pancreatic cancer. Importantly, depletion of RP11-567G11.1 boosts the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine, suggesting that this lncRNA is a promising target for pancreatic cancer treatment. © 2019 The Authors","Cancer stem cell; Gemcitabine; Notch signaling; Pancreatic cancer; RP11-567G11.1",Article,Scopus

The role of miR-93 in human cancers is inconsistent and the underlying mechanism on the aberrant expression of miR-93 is complicated. Methods: We first conducted gene enrichment analysis to give insight into the prospective mechanism of miR-93. Second, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical value of miR-93. Finally, a validation test based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to further investigate the role of miR-93 in pan-cancer. Results: Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis results showed that the target genes of miR-93 were closely related to transcription, and MAPK1, RBBP7 and Smad7 became the hub genes. In the diagnostic meta-analysis, the overall sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve were 0.76 (0.64-0.85), 0.82 (0.64-0.92), and 0.85 (0.82-0.88), respectively, which suggested that miR-93 had excellent performance on the diagnosis for human cancers. In the prognostic meta-analysis, dysregulated miR-93 was found to be associated with poor OS in cancer patients. In the qPCR validation test, the serum levels of miR-93 were upregulated in breast cancer, breast hyperplasia, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, nasopharyngeal cancer, hepatocellular cancer, gastric ulcer, endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, laryngeal cancer, and prostate cancer compared with healthy controls. Conclusions: miR-93 could act as an effective diagnostic and prognostic factor for cancer patients.

In Western societies, many of these women are working age, and therefore, potentially desire to return to the work force. We aimed to evaluate the unemployment risk for up to 8 years following a breast cancer diagnosis and identify contributing socio-economic factors. Methods: This historical prospective study included baseline measurements from the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics 1995 National Census, with follow-up to 2011. We retrieved data on employment from the Israeli Tax Authority database and cancer status from the National Cancer Registry. A control group without cancer was selected to match the patients. Analyses were controlled for socio-economic factors and the baseline employment status 2 years prior to diagnosis. Results: We retrieved data for 2341 patients with breast cancer and 6837 age-matched women without cancer. We found an elevated risk of unemployment during the 8 years after breast cancer diagnosis (2-year OR 1.82, 95%CI: 1.59–2.075; 8-year OR 1.26, 95%CI: 1.07–1.47). Age and all examined socio-economic variables were correlated to increased risk of unemployment. The strongest predictor was pre-diagnosis unemployment (2-year OR 18.95, 95%CI: 16.68–21.52; 8-year OR 4.92, 95%CI: 4.07–5.96). Surprisingly, patients with axillary involvement were associated with less risk of unemployment than other patients. Conclusions: Breast cancer survivorship was associated with long-term risk of unemployment. Older patients and patients with lower socio-economic status were at increased risk of unemployment. © 2018","Breast cancer; Cancer survivors; Socioeconomic status; Unemployment",Article,Scopus

Identification of reliable biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic targets is necessary for drug development and cancer treatment. In this study, we identified that the antipsychotic chlorpromazine (CPZ) exhibited potent anti-breast cancer and anti-CSC capabilities. Treatment with CPZ suppressed stemness properties including mammosphere formation, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, and stemness-related gene expressions in breast cancer cells and CSCs. Moreover, CPZ increased the susceptibility of breast cancer MCF7 cells and drug-resistant MCF7/ADR cells when combined with chemotherapies. Mechanistically, we identified that CPZ suppressed yes-associated protein (YAP) through modulating Hippo signaling and promoting proteasomal degradation of YAP. Elevated expression of YAP was confirmed to be crucial for stemness-related gene expressions, and was associated with invasiveness and stem-like signatures in breast cancer patients. Moreover, overexpression of YAP conferred poor outcomes particularly of basal-like breast cancer patients.

CAFs are usually derived from normal fibroblasts (NFs), but the mechanism of the transition in gastric cancer has not yet been fully elucidated. Methods: qRT-PCR and western blot were employed to investigate differences of miR-141 and STAT4 expression respectively. The CAF-like features and wnt/β-catenin pathway related proteins in NF or BMSC were assessed by qRT-PCR or western blot after treated with the conditioned medium from different indicated groups of gastric cancer cells. The invasion and migration ability of AGS cells after transfection were analyzed by Transwell assay and wound healing assay. Dual-luciferase report assay was employed to determine the direct binding of miR-141 to STAT4 3’ UTR. Results: For the first time, the present study found that STAT4 over-expression in gastric cancer cells induced NFs to obtain CAF-like features via activating wnt/β-catenin pathway. Further gain-of-function and loss-of-function analysis revealed that miR-141 not only limited the migration and invasion of the gastric cancer cells, but also inhibited the transition of NFs and BMSC to CAFs. The luciferase assay indicated that miR-141 directly targeted the 3’-UTR predictive sequence of STAT4.

Furthermore, although it is largely recognized that members of the gastrointestinal microbiota are actively involved in drug metabolism, new studies demonstrate additional roles and the potential necessity of the gastrointestinal microbiota in dictating cancer treatment response. Objective: To summarize the current evidence of a mechanistic role for the genitourinary and gastrointestinal microbiome in genitourinary cancer initiation and treatment response. Evidence acquisition: We conducted a literature search up to October 2018. Search terms included microbiome, microbiota, urinary microbiome, bladder cancer, urothelial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, kidney cancer, testicular cancer, and prostate cancer. Evidence synthesis: There is preliminary evidence to implicate the members of the genitourinary microbiota as causative factors or cofactors in genitourinary malignancy. Likewise, the current evidence for gastrointestinal microbes in dictating cancer treatment response is mainly correlative; however, we provide examples where therapeutic agents used for the treatment of genitourinary cancers are affected by the human-associated microbiota, or vice versa. Clinical trials, such as fecal microbiota transplant to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy, are currently underway. Conclusions: The role of the microbiome in genitourinary cancer is an emerging field that merits further studies. Translating microbiome research into clinical action will require incorporation of microbiome surveillance into ongoing and future clinical trials as well as expansion of studies to include metagenomic sequencing and metabolomics. Patient summary: This review covers recent evidence that microbial populations that reside in the genitourinary tract—and were previously not known to exist—may influence the development of genitourinary malignancies including bladder, kidney, and prostate cancers. Furthermore, microbial populations that exist at sites outside of the genitourinary tract, such as those that reside in our gut, may influence cancer development and/or treatment response. There is evidence that the urinary microbiome influences the development of genitourinary malignancies, including bladder, kidney, and prostate cancers. Furthermore, the gastrointestinal microbiota may also influence genitourinary cancer development and/or treatment response via effects on drug metabolism and systemic immunity. © 2019 European Association of Urology","Bladder cancer; Immunotherapy; Kidney cancer; Microbiome; Prostate cancer",Review,Scopus

This treatment modality is not part of standard treatment recommendations, and we hypothesized that adjuvant RT provides a benefit in locally advanced disease. Due to the limited number who receive post-operative RT, a national database was searched to provide sufficient power. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was performed. Inclusion criteria were: non-rectal colon cancer, AJCC 6th or 7th edition T4 and M0, oncologic resection, and 1st cancer site. Patients were excluded for RT prior to or during surgery, or if the sequence of RT was unknown. Using a Cox proportional hazard model, the relative risk of cause-specific mortality for “RT after surgery” versus “No RT” was calculated. Results: 21,789 patients were identified who met the inclusion criteria. Of these, only 1001 received adjuvant RT, and 64% were node-positive (53% RT vs. 65% no RT). When comparing RT vs. no RT, after adjusting for sex, age, N stage, and grade, we determined the relative risk of death from cancer was 0.8849 (95% CI: 0.8008–0.9779; p = 0.0165), suggesting that only 14 patients with T4 disease need receive adjuvant radiation to spare a cancer-related death.

Methods: Hispanics/Latinos diagnosed with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer within 15 months of treatment completion (n = 288) completed questionnaires as part of an NCI-funded project. Results: Hispanic/Latino cancer survivors reported greater unmet needs compared to previously published norms in primarily non-Hispanic/Latino white samples. Across the three cancer types, the two most common unmet needs were in the psychological domain: fear of metastasis (32.6%) and concern for close others (31.3%). However, unmet needs varied by cancer type. Factors associated with greater unmet needs included more recent cancer diagnosis (OR.98 [.96–.99]), younger age (OR.96–.97 [.93–.99]), female gender (OR 2.53–3.75 [1.53–7.36]), and being single (OR 1.82 [1.11–2.97]). Breast cancer survivors reported greater unmet needs than both prostate and colorectal cancer survivors (OR 2.33–5.86 [1.27–14.01]).

Studies have focused on the pathogenesis of breast cancer for decades, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Tripartite motif-containing 11 (TRIM11), a novel oncogene that was recently identified, was reported to function in various types of cancer, including ovarian and lung cancer. In the present study, high expression levels of TRIM11 were detected in breast cancer tissues by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, which suggested that TRIM11 was likely to function in the progression of breast cancer. Downregulation of TRIM11 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis, accompanied by increased phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), p53 and Bcl-2-associated X protein, and decreased B-cell lymphoma 2, phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 (p-JNK1/2) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (p-ERK1/2), whereas the overexpression of TRIM11 completely reversed these effects. Furthermore, TRIM11 downregulation enhanced the pro-apoptotic effect of chemotherapy drugs on breast cancer cells, and high levels of TRIM11 expression were observed in cisplatin- and paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer tissues. These data indicated that TRIM11 is crucial to the development of breast cancer, and TRIM11 downregulation may benefit the treatment of breast cancer by regulating ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 signaling and the expression of apoptosis-associated genes. © 2019 Spandidos Publications.

Many studies have also shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in many biological processes. Therefore, we aimed to explore whether lncRNAs participate in the mechanisms by which metformin affects gastric cancer cells. In the current study, we found that metformin significantly inhibited the cellular functions of gastric cancer cells through Cell Counting Kit-8 and invasion assays. We found that lncRNA H19 was greatly downregulated in gastric cancer cells treated with metformin using lncRNA microassays. Based on bioinformatics analyses of the Oncomine and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases, H19 is shown to be overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues, with increased expression of H19 relating to advanced pathological tumor stage and pathological tumor node metastasis stage, indicating that H19 may be associated with the invasive ability of gastric cancer. We knocked down H19 in AGS and SGC7901 cell lines and found that knocked-down H19 could decrease gastric cancer cell invasion and that metformin could not further decrease invasion after the knock down. Moreover, H19 depletion increased AMPK activation and decreased MMP9 expression, and metformin could not further activate AMPK or decrease MMP9 in H19 knocked-down gastric cancer cells. In summary, metformin has a profound antitumor effect on gastric cancer cells, and H19 is a key component in the process of metformin suppressing gastric cancer cell invasion. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","bioinformatics; gastric cancer; H19; lncRNA; metformin",Article,Scopus

We then used the available data to project the number of new cervical cancer cases for the period 2013–2049. Data on cervical cancer incidence and mortality in Vietnam are limited; two Vietnamese cancer registries have been reported on by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which cover urban populations representing ∼20% of the national population. The reported age-standardized cervical cancer incidence in Hanoi was 6.7 (1993–1997), compared to 28.8 and 14.1 per 100,000 women in Ho Chi Minh City (1995–1998 and 2009–2012, respectively). Cancer mortality data are not uniformly available from cancer registries or mortality surveys in Vietnam because cause of death has not been routinely ascertained. Based on available urban population registry data, estimated rates in the rural population, and forward projection of existing trends, we estimate that without any further intervention, the number of new cases will increase from 6930 (range 5671–8493) in 2012 to 8562 (range 5775–12,762) in 2049, giving a total of 379,617 (range 276,879–542,941) new cases over the period 2013–2049.

The ABC measure includes statements about six general beliefs about cancer and three beliefs about CRC screening. These data were combined with register-based information on CRC screening behaviour, which was obtained from the Danish Colorectal Cancer Screening Database. Multivariate analyses showed that individuals who tended to agree that they would worry about what might be found in the CRC screening (PR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.24–2.23) and individuals who strongly agreed that screening is only necessary if symptoms are present (PR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.05–1.75) were more likely to be non-participants than individuals who strongly disagreed with these beliefs.

Through analyzing information diffusion networks of cancer-related information on Weibo, the results revealed that sender factors played determining roles in affecting information diffusion.

It is now evident that arsenic contamination in food, especially rice and grains, presents a significant exposure to hundreds of millions of individuals worldwide. However, the disease risk from chronic exposure to the low amounts of arsenic found in food remains to be established. Thus, this research estimates the global burdens of disease expressed as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for lung, skin and bladder cancers, as well as coronary heart disease (CHD) attributable to inorganic arsenic in food. To determine foodborne inorganic arsenic exposures worldwide, we used the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates of food consumption in 17 country clusters, in conjunction with the reported measurements of total and inorganic arsenic in different foods. We estimated cancer potency factors for arsenic related bladder and lung cancers, and from US Environmental Protection Agency risk estimates for skin cancer to calculate the cancer incidence in males and females within each of the WHO member states. Summary relative risk estimates and population attributable fractions were developed to estimate the YLD, YLL, and DALYs for arsenic-induced CHD. The findings indicate that, globally, each year the combined DALYs for all cancers attributable to inorganic arsenic in food are approximately 1.4 million with variation in global distribution based on population and food consumption patterns. The global burden of CHD attributable to foodborne inorganic arsenic also varied with WHO region and may contribute as much as 49 million DALYs. However, in contrast to cancer burden, there is a threshold effect for arsenic-associated CHD with no increased risk of heart disease at the expected lower bound of arsenic consumption in food. These estimates indicate that foodborne arsenic exposure causes a significant yet avoidable global burden of human disease. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Arsenic; Cancer; Coronary heart disease; Diet; Disability-Adjusted life year; Foodborne burden of disease",Article,Scopus

It is not clear whether changes in the population at risk (women with intact uteruses) have contributed to an increased uterine cancer incidence. This study aims to assess the effect of changing trends in hysterectomy prevalence on uterine cancer incidence in Scotland. Methods: The population of women aged ≥25 years with intact uteri was estimated using the estimated hysterectomy prevalence in 1995 and the number of procedures performed in Scotland (1996–2015). Age-standardized uterine cancer incidence was estimated using uncorrected (total) or corrected (adjusted for hysterectomy prevalence) populations as denominators and the number of incident cancers as numerators. Annual percentage change in uterine cancer was estimated. Results: Hysterectomy prevalence fell from 13% to 10% between 1996–2000 and 2011–2015, with the most marked decline (from 20% to 6%) in the 50–54-year age group. After correction for hysterectomy prevalence, age-standardized incidence of uterine cancer increased by 20–22%. Annual percentage change in incidence of uterine cancer remained stable through the study period and was 2.2% (95%CI 1.8–2.7) and 2.1% (95%CI 1.7–2.6) for uncorrected and corrected estimates, respectively. Conclusion: Uterine cancer incidence in Scotland corrected for hysterectomy prevalence is higher than estimates using a total female population as denominator. The annual percentage increase in uterine cancer incidence was stable in both uncorrected and corrected populations despite a declining hysterectomy prevalence. The rise in uterine cancer incidence may thus be driven by other factors, including an ageing population, changing reproductive choices, and obesity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cancer; Endometrial; Hysterectomy; Uterine; Womb",Article,Scopus

Indeed, carcinogenesis and malignancy are highly associated with metabolic re-programming, and there is clinical evidence that interrupting a cancer's metabolic program can improve patients’ outcomes. Notably, many of the metabolic adaptations observed in cancer are similar to the same perturbations observed in diabetic patients. For example, metformin is commonly used to reduce hyperglycemia in diabetic patients, and has been demonstrated to reduce cancer incidence. Treatment with PI3K inhibitors can induce hyperinsulinemia, which can blunt therapeutic efficacy if unchecked. While commonalities between metabolism in cancer and diabetes have been extensively reviewed, here we examine a less explored and emergent convergence between diabetic and cancer metabolism: the generation of lactic acid and subsequent acidification of the surrounding microenvironment. Extracellular lactic acidosis is integral in disease manifestation and is a negative prognostic in both disease states. In tumors, this results in important sequela for cancer progression including increased invasion and metastasis, as well as inhibition of immune surveillance. In diabetes, acidosis impacts the ability of insulin to bind to its receptor, leading to peripheral resistance and an exacerbation of symptoms. Thus, acidosis may be a relevant therapeutic target, and we describe three approaches for targeting: buffers, nanomedicine, and proton pump inhibitors. © 2019",,Review,Scopus

Identification of sexual problems and concerns is key to enable appropriate management. Therefore, there is a need for a valid and reliable instrument for evaluating the sexuality of patients. This study aimed to adapt the sexuality scale for women with gynecologic cancer for Turkish patients with gynecologic cancer. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 150 volunteer patients with gynecologic cancer was undertaken in Turkey. The patients completed a semi-structured demographic data form and the sexuality scale for women with gynecologic cancer. We assessed the reliability, language accuracy, and content and construct validities of the Turkish version of the scale. Results: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses showed that the scale had four factors. In the exploratory factor analysis, seven items were discarded from the scale because their load values were <0.3. In the confirmatory factor analysis, the coefficients were higher than 0.3. The total Cronbach's α was 0.72.

Oldenlandia diffusa has been empirically and extensively used as an adjuvant therapy for metastatic breast cancer patients in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with proven efficacy. However, its anti-metastasis mechanism has been poorly revealed. Methods: Multiple molecular biology experiments as well as network pharmacology, bioinformatics analysis were conducted to investigate the anti-metastasis mechanism of Oldenlandia diffusa in breast cancer. Results: We demonstrated that ethanol extract of Oldenlandia diffusa (EEOD) significantly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of high-metastatic breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453, while having no obvious cytotoxic effect on multiple nonmalignant cells. Furthermore, EEOD remarkably suppressed the migration and invasion capacities of the above breast cancer cells by modulating the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. More importantly, EEOD also significantly inhibited breast cancer metastasis in zebrafish xenotransplantation model in vivo. Network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis further demonstrated that EEOD yielded 12 candidate compounds and 225 potential targets, and shared 85 putative targets associated with breast cancer metastasis. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing and experimental validation results suggested that EEOD might inhibit breast cancer metastasis by attenuating the expression of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) as overexpression of Cav-1 could weaken the anti-metastasis efficacy of EEOD. Conclusions: Overall, our findings proved that EEOD could inhibit breast cancer metastasis by attenuating the expression of Cav-1, highlighting the use of EEOD as an adjunctive therapy for metastatic breast cancer patients. This study also provides novel insights into network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis as effective tools to illuminate the scientific basis of TCM. © 2019 The Authors","Bioinformatics analysis; Breast cancer; Caveolin-1; Metastasis; Network pharmacology; Oldenlandia diffusa",Article,Scopus

Methods: We used luciferase reporter assay, real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot to identify sex-determining region Y-box2 (SOX2) as the target gene of miR-145-5p. Their expression levels in breast cancer tissues (n = 122) were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We also applied 3-(4,5-dimethyl- 2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay and flow cytometry to reveal the effect of miR-145-5p on proliferation in breast cancer. Results: miR-145-5p expression is downregulated in breast cancer tissues and negatively correlated with SOX2 expression.

LIF inhibits the proliferation and survival of several myeloid leukemia cells but promotes tumor progression and metastasis in many solid tumors. However, the relationship between LIF and gastric cancer has not been well understood. LIF was downregulated in gastric cancer as detected by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Notably, LIF was downregulated in approximately 70% (56/80) of primary gastric cancers, in which it was significantly associated with advanced clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor overall survival (median 5-year survival = 26 vs. 43 months for patients with high LIF expression and low LIF expression gastric cancer, respectively). To study the potential function of LIF in the downregulation of gastric cancer, we monitored the behavior using proliferation, cell cycle, and flow cytometry analysis. Overexpression of LIF inhibited the gastric cancer cell cycle in the G1 phase. In our experiment, overexpression of LIF by lentivirus upregulated P21 and downregulated cyclin D1. Recombinant human LIF also downregulated P21 and cyclin D1 at various times. A further in vivo tumor formation study in nude mice indicated that overexpression of LIF in gastric cancer significantly delayed the progress of tumor formation.

Cell transfection was used to change the expression of HULC and miR-15a in pancreatic cancer Panc-1 cells. The viability, migration and invasion and apoptosis of Panc-1 cells after relevant transfection were detected using CCK-8 assay, two chamber transwell assay and Guava Nexin assay, respectively. Results found that HULC had a higher expression level, while miR-15a had a lower expression level in pancreatic cancer tissues. Overexpression of HULC promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of Panc-1 cells. Suppression of HULC had opposite effects and dramatically induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, HULC negatively regulated the expression of miR-15a in Panc-1 cells. miR-15a participated in the effects of HULC on Panc-1 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of HULC activated PI3K/AKT pathway in Panc-1 cells by down-regulating miR-15a. In conclusion, HULC exerted oncogenic role in pancreatic cancer.

However, little is known about the role of miR-449b-5p in breast cancer. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression level, biological function and underlying mechanism of miR-449b-5p in breast cancer. Our results showed that miR-449b-5p expression was frequently down-regulated in breast cancer cell lines and tissues. The overexpression of miR-449b-5p significantly inhibited growth and invasion, and induced the cell cycle arrest of breast cancer cells. In contrast, the inhibition of miR-449b-5p showed the opposite effect. Interestingly, bioinformatic analysis predicted that cell cycle-related and expression-elevated protein in tumor (CREPT), an important oncogene in breast cancer, was a potential target gene of miR-449b-5p. The overexpression of miR-449b-5p decreased CREPT expression while miR-449b-5p inhibition promoted CREPT expression in breast cancer cells. Restoration of CREPT expression in miR-449b-5p mimics transfected cells partially reversed the suppressive effect of miR-449b-5p on breast cancer cell growth and invasion. Notably, our results showed that miR-449b-5p overexpression decreased the expression of β-catenin and suppressed the activation of Wnt/β-catenin/TCF-4 signaling via targeting CREPT. In addition, blocking Wnt/β-catenin partially reversed the promotion effect of miR-449b-5p inhibition on breast cancer cell growth and invasion. Overall, these results reveal a tumor suppressive role of miR-449b-5p that restricts the growth and invasion of breast cancer cells through targeting CREPT and inhibiting CREPT-mediated activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Our study suggests that the miR-449b-5p/CREPT/Wnt/β-catenin axis may play an important role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and miR-449–5p may serve as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Breast cancer; CREPT; miR-449–5p; Wnt/β-catenin",Article,Scopus

Paclitaxel is a conventional chemotherapeutic drug used in the clinical treatment of breast cancer. However, the function and mechanism of Beclin1 in paclitaxel-mediated cytotoxicity in breast cancer are not well defined. The present study demonstrated that paclitaxel suppressed cell viability and Beclin1 expression levels in BT-474 breast cancer cells in a dose-and time-dependent fashion. Compared with the control, the knockdown of Beclin1 significantly enhanced breast cancer cell death via the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis following paclitaxel treatment in vitro (P<0.05). In a BT-474 xenograft model, paclitaxel achieved substantial inhibition of tumor growth in the Beclin1 knockdown group compared with the control group. Furthermore, analysis of the publicly available Gene Expression Omnibus datasets revealed a clinical correlation between Beclin1 levels and the response to paclitaxel therapy in patients with breast cancer. Collectively, the present results suggest that Beclin1 protects breast cancer cells from apoptotic death. Thus, the inhibition of Beclin1 may be a novel way to improve the effect of paclitaxel.

ICA inhibited the expression of fuse binding protein 1 (FBP1), a critical regulator of proliferation and tumorigenesis through binding to the c-Myc promoter, as well as β-catenin, a key regulator in ovarian cancer initiation, metastasis, chemoresistance and recurrence. Furthermore, it was indicated that ICA inhibited the migration of SKOV3 cells. In accordance with our previous findings on high FBP1 expression in ovarian cancer, FBP1 was a potential target of ICA in ovarian cancer cells. Based on these results, the present study demonstrated that ICA may be a potential therapeutic agent for ovarian cancer treatment. © 2019 Spandidos Publications.

Activation of the CXCLs/CXCR2 axis activates multiple signalling pathways, including the PI3K, p38/ERK, and JAK pathways, and regulates cell survival and migration. The CXCLs/CXCR2 axis plays a vital role in the tumour microenvironment and in recruiting neutrophils to inflammatory sites. Extensive infiltration of neutrophils during chronic inflammation is one of the most important pathogenic factors in various inflammatory diseases. Chronic inflammation is considered to be closely correlated with initiation of cancer. In addition, immunosuppressive effects of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) against T cells attenuate the anti-tumour effects of T cells and promote tumour invasion and metastasis. Over the last several decades, many therapeutic strategies targeting CXCR2 have shown promising results and entered clinical trials. In this review, we focus on the features and functions of the CXCLs/CXCR2 axis and highlight its role in cancer and inflammatory diseases. We also discuss its potential use in targeted therapies. © 2019 The Authors","Cancer; CXC chemokine receptor 2; CXC chemokines; Inflammation; Targeted therapy",Review,Scopus

The aim of the present study was to determine whether SPAG9 regulates proliferation of liver cancer. Immunohistochemistry and cell immunofluorescence were used to confirm the expression and the localization of SPAG9 in human liver cancer tissues and the liver cancer-derived HepG2 cells. A small interfering RNA (siRNA) designed to target SPAG9 was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000, and proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle progression were analyzed using CCK‑8 assay and flow cytometry; western blotting was used to detect the expression of SPAG9, JNK, p38, MKK3 and MKK6, and co-immunoprecipitation was used to assess the interaction between SPAG9 and JNK. SPAG9 was overexpressed in 16 out of 20 (80%) patients with liver cancer. The protein was localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of liver cancer cells obtained from patients and in HepG2 cells. Depletion of SPAG9 inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells, promoted apoptosis and arrested the cell cycle at the S phase. Moreover, cells deficient in SPAG9 had decreased expression of JNK, p38 and MKK3 compared to HepG2 cells not treated with an siRNA targeting SPAG9. In the present study, SPAG9 was revealed to regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle progression in liver cancer cells through the SPAG9/MKK3/p38 axis.

Chemotherapy is one of the main treatments for breast cancer, but causes a decline in life quality of patients. Self-care is a non-medical intervention and has been reported to improve the life quality of colorectal cancer patients. We aim to explore whether self-care is also effective in breast cancer. Materials and methods: 85 breast cancer patients under chemotherapy participated in this research, among whom 44 patients received the self-care education. The physical and mental conditions of patients before and after chemotherapy were evaluated by Anxiety Inventory, Rotterdam Symptom checklists and QLQ-C30. Results: The result showed that the occurrence rates of symptoms were significantly reduced after self-care measures. Anxiety Inventory and Rotterdam Symptom checklists indicated that self-care measures could improve both the physical and mental conditions of patients. The Global Quality of Life (QoL) from QLQ-C30 questionnaire further confirmed the effectiveness of self-care measures in breast cancer patients. Conclusions: Based on the results, self-care measures are effective in improving the physical and mental conditions of breast cancer patients under chemotherapy.

Breast cancer is influenced by cholesterol membrane content, by affecting the signaling pathways modulating cell growth, adherence, and migration. Furthermore, steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol and these play a key role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Although most findings have reported an inverse association between serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol level and the risk of breast cancer, there have been some reports of the opposite, and the association therefore remains unclear. HDL is principally known for participating in reverse cholesterol transport and has an inverse relationship with the cardiovascular risk. HDL is heterogeneous, with particles varying in composition, size, and structure, which can be altered under different circumstances, such as inflammation, aging, and certain diseases. It has also been proposed that HDL functionality might have a bearing on the breast cancer. Owing to the potential role of cholesterol in cancer, its reduction using statins, and particularly as an adjuvant during chemotherapy may be useful in the anticancer treatment, and may also be related to the decline in cancer mortality. Reconstituted HDLs have the ability to release chemotherapeutic drugs inside the cell. As a consequence, this may be a novel way to improve therapeutic targeting for the breast cancer on the basis of detrimental impacts of oxidized HDL on cancer development. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","breast cancer; high-density lipoprotein function; high-density lipoprotein transporter; reconstituted high-density lipoprotein; therapy",Article,Scopus

The specific mechanism of vemurafenib resistance is not clear in colon cancer. In this study, we demonstrated that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation influenced vemurafenib sensitivity in BRAF V600E mutant colon cancer cells. When vemurafenib was applied to two colon cancer cell lines with the BRAF V600E mutation, STAT3 was continuously activated after 6 hours. Furthermore, BCL-2 was upregulated in RKO colon cancer cells, while STAT3 remained unchanged in HT-29 colon cancer cells. This suggested that STAT3 signaling might be involved in vemurafenib sensitivity. Combining the STAT3 inhibitor STATTIC with vemurafenib further inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis by downregulating STAT3 and BCL-2 expression in RKO cells. Further studies showed that interleukin 6 (IL-6) secretion increased after RKO cells were treated with vemurafenib. STAT3 activation was induced by adding IL-6 to the supernatant, and IL-6 increased STAT3 and BCL-2 expression and antagonized vemurafenib sensitivity in HT-29 cells. Together, these results suggest that STAT3 activation maybe related to vemurafenib sensitivity in colon cancer cells, and that combining STAT3 inhibitors with vemurafenib may be a promising treatment for BRAF V600E mutant colon cancers. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","apoptosis; colon cancer; proliferation; signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; vemurafenib",Article,Scopus

Moreover, predictions that this population is increasing have not been tested. This study provides data on the number and sociodemographic characteristics of parents with cancer and their young children (aged 0–11 years) in the state of Western Australia, and investigates whether long-term trends in this population have increased over time. Methods: Linked administrative data were used to describe parents with malignant cancer and their children aged 0–11 years at the time of diagnosis between 1982 and 2015 in Western Australia. Parents and children were described overall and by year of diagnosis and sociodemographic characteristics. A Poisson regression was used to investigate trends in the number of children affected, accounting for population growth. Incidence counts of parental cancer characteristics were included. Results: Between 1982 and 2015, 15,938 parents were diagnosed with a malignant cancer, affecting 25,901 children. In 2015, 0.28% of children in Western Australia experienced a parent’s diagnosis. The number of children affected increased over time; however, this was accounted for by population growth. The majority of families lived in regional areas and were of high socioeconomic status. Older children and older parents most frequently experienced parental cancer. Skin and breast cancer were the most common diagnoses. Conclusions: A substantial number of families are affected by parental cancer.

Our aim was to describe, for the first time, the distribution of cases by stage at diagnosis and differences in stage-specific survival on a population basis for a range of childhood solid cancers in Australia. Methods: The study cohort was drawn from the population-based Australian Childhood Cancer Registry and comprised children (<15 years) diagnosed with one of 12 solid malignancies between 2006 and 2014. Stage at diagnosis was assigned according to the Toronto Paediatric Cancer Stage Guidelines. Observed (all cause) survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with follow-up on mortality available to 31 December 2015. Results: Almost three-quarters (1256 of 1760 cases, 71%) of children in the study had localised or regional disease at diagnosis, varying from 43% for neuroblastoma to 99% for retinoblastoma. Differences in 5-year observed survival by stage were greatest for osteosarcoma (localised 85% (95% CI = 72%–93%) versus metastatic 37% (15%–59%)), neuroblastoma (localised 98% (91%–99%) versus metastatic 60% (52%–67%)), rhabdomyosarcoma (localised 85% (71%–93%) versus metastatic 53% (34%–69%)), and medulloblastoma (localised 69% (61%–75%) versus metastases to spine 42% (27%–57%)). Conclusion: The stage-specific information presented here provides a basis for comparison with other international population cancer registries.

Results: Participants reported using 0.93 (±1.20) CAM activities (e.g., yoga), 0.62 (±0.71) resources (e.g., the library), and 1.62 (±1.34) services (e.g., monthly support groups), although also reported experiencing 0.74 (±0.81) barriers (e.g., transportation) to accessing these offerings. Perceived benefits were interrelated, where those perceiving CAM offerings to improve their understanding of their health needs also perceived improved emotional health (χ 2 = 27.93, P &lt; 0.001) and better self-care (χ 2 = 30.90, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Greater utilization of CAM offerings was also associated with greater perceived benefits. These results highlight the benefits of CAM therapies for cancer patients’ well-being. Integration of CAM therapies in standard cancer care should be encouraged to complement cancer treatment. © 2019","Cancer centers; Complementary and alternative medicine; Emotional health; Self-management",Article,Scopus

However, little is known regarding its involvement and potential mechanism in human breast cancer. In this study, we explored the effect of MEG3 on the growth of human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 in vitro and in vivo, and sought to elucidate the potential signaling mechanisms. Ectopic overexpression of MEG3 using a lentiviral vector Lv-MEG3 significantly inhibited breast cancer cell growth in vitro and a cancer xenograft growth in vivo. MEG3 overexpression led to marked increase of apoptosis in breast cancer cells as determined using flow cytometry and fragmented DNA labeling. Moreover, ectopic expression of MEG3 increased the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress–related proteins required for unfolded protein response, including glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), and activated transcription factor 6 (ATF6), as well as proapoptotic proteins CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and caspase-3. Finally, MEG3 overexpression markedly increased nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) expression, NF-κB translocation to the nucleus, and p53 expression, whereas pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB completely abolished MEG3-induced activation of p53. Together, these results suggest that MEG3 inhibits breast cancer growth and induces breast cancer apoptosis, partially via the activation of the ER stress, NF-κB and p53 pathways, and that NF-κB signaling is required for MEG3-induced p53 activation in breast cancer cells.

The expressions of messenger RNA and microRNAs in breast cancer tissues and adjacent tissues were analyzed by the Cancer Genome Atlas microarray analysis. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was conducted to find out the expression levels of miR-99a-5p and CDC25A. The expression levels of proteins (CDC25A, ki67, cyclin D1, p21, BAX, BCL-2, BCL-XL, MMP2, and MMP9) were determined by Western blot analysis. The relationship between miR-99a-5p and CDC25A was predicted and verified by bioinformatics analysis and dual luciferase assay. After transfection, cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis of breast cancer tissues were, respectively, observed by cell counting kit-8 assay, transwell assay, and flow cytometry (FCM). Furthermore, the relationship among miR-99a-5p, CDC25A, and cell-cycle progression was determined by FCM assay. The nude mouse transplantation tumor experiment was performed to verify the influence of miR-99a-5p on breast cancer cell in vivo. The expression of miR-99a-5p in breast cancer tissues and cells was significantly downregulated, whereas CDC25A expression was upregulated. MiR-99a-5p targeted CDC25A and suppressed its expression in breast cancer cells. Overexpression of miR-99a-5p and decreased expression of CDC25A could suppress breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion and facilitate apoptosis. Cell-cycle progression was significantly activated by downregulated miR-99a-5p and upregulated CDC25A.

Notch plays an important role in the maintenance of CSC in many cancers including cervical cancer. Previously, we have reported the role of Fused Toes Homolog (FTS) in conferring radioresistance in cervical cancer cells in vitro and human subjects. The present study investigated the regulatory role of FTS in Notch signaling and maintenance of CSC upon irradiation of cervical cancer cells. The expression of Notch1, 2, 3, cleaved Notch1 and its downstream target Hes1, and spheroid formation was increased by irradiation. Silencing of FTS prevented the radiation-induced increase in the expression of Notch signaling molecules and spheroid formation. Immunoprecipitation showed FTS binds Notch1 and Hes1. Also in silico structural analysis identified putative residues responsible for the binding between FTS and Notch1. Spheroid formation and the expression of CSC markers, Nanog, Oct4A and Sox2 were greatly reduced by combining silencing of FTS and radiation. Taken together, these results suggest that FTS is involved in the regulation of irradiation-induced Notch signaling and CSC activation and can be used as a target to increase radiosensitivity in cervical cancer. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cancer stem cells; Cervical cancer; Fused Toes Homolog; Notch; Radiation",Article,Scopus

Papaya fruit has a massive cell wall disassembling during ripening that naturally changes its pectin structure. Our work shows that different points in the ripening time of papaya fruit exhibit pectins (chelate-soluble fractions; CSF) that can or cannot inhibit galectin-3. The fraction that inhibits galectin-3 (3CSF) also diminishes the proliferation of colon cancer cell lines, and it is derived from an intermediate point of papaya ripening.

Many strategies of cancer treatment such as chemotherapy are developed and used nowadays. However, for the cancer chemotherapy resistance, reduction of the limitation of cancer chemotherapy efficacy is one of the aims of several oncology teams. Moreover, the cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6-cyclin D-retinoblastoma protein-E2F pathway is an important mechanism for cell cycle control and its dysregulation is one of the key factors for cancers development including cervical cancer. Ribociclib is one of the selective CDK4/6 inhibitors and is a new therapeutic approach showing promise as a good strategy of therapy in many human cancers. However, there are not the studies regarding the investigation of effects of Ribociclib in cervical cancer yet. In the present study, by western blotting and immunofluorescence assay, we found respectively that CDK4, CDK6 and cyclin D1 are highly expressed and are mostly localized in the nucleus with some localized in the cytoplasm of cervical cancer cell lines. Moreover, Ribociclib induced cell cycle arrest in G0-G1 phase and cell apoptosis, and inhibited C33A cell proliferation in dose – dependent manner following by decreased expression of certain related genes such as CDK4, CDK6, E2F1, P-Rb, and increased Bax expression. In C33A xenografts, Ribociclib inhibited tumor growth associated with decreased expressions of CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, Rb and Ki-67, and also significantly increased tumor cell apoptosis. However, we didn't find side effect of Ribociclib concerning heart, liver and kidney perturbation and any Ribociclib anti-tumor effects on HeLa in vitro and in vivo which may be due to Hela cell infection by HPV. Based on our findings, the Rb-E2F pathway can be considered as an important factor in human cervical cancer pathogenesis and as a mechanism of Ribociclib, a potential strategy of treatment for the improvement of new therapeutic measures for the treatment of HPV-negative cervical cancer which application for HPV-positive cervical cancer is desired in further study. © 2019","CDK4; CDK6; Cell apoptosis; Cell cycle; Cervical cancer; Ribociclib",Article,Scopus

As a consequence of multidrug resistance, cancer treatment must rely on a host of chemotherapeutic agents and chemosensitizers to achieve remission. To overcome these problems, a series of biodegradable triblock copolymers of PEG, guanidinium-functionalized polycarbonate and polylactide (PEG-PGC x -PDLA y ) is designed as chemotherapeutic agents. These copolymers self-assemble into micellar nanoparticles, and are highly effective against various cancer cell lines including human breast cancer (BCap37), liver cancer (HepG2), lung cancer (A549) and epidermoid carcinoma (A431) cell lines as well as MDR Bats-72 and Bads-200 cancer cells that were developed from BCap37. Multiple treatments with the polymers at sub-lethal doses do not induce resistance. The polymers kill cancer cells by a non-apoptotic mechanism with significant vacuolization and subsequent membrane disruption. In vivo antitumor efficacy is evaluated in a metastatic 4T1 subcutaneous tumor model. Treatment with stereocomplexes of PEG-PGC 43 -PLLA 19 and PEG-PGC 43 -PDLA 20 at a dose of 20 mg/kg of mouse body weight suppresses tumor growth and inhibits tumor metastasis in vivo.

The 5-year distant failure-free survival (DFFS) rate was also significantly different among four groups (84.6% vs. 61.4% vs. 54.2% vs 48.6%; p < 0.001). Although adjuvant chemotherapy did not affect 5-year DFFS in the entire cohort, adjuvant chemotherapy significantly reduced the distant failure rate in patients with PNI+ patients (44.9% vs. 54.6%, p = 0.048), not LVI+ patients (65.0% vs. 56.1%, p = 0.487). Conclusion: Compared to LVI, PNI is a more significant prognostic factor in stage II–III rectal patients treated by preoperative CRT and TME surgery. The status of PNI rather than LVI could be an indicator for identifying patients who could benefit from adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Adjuvant chemotherapy; Lymphovascular invasion; Perineural invasion; Rectal cancer",Article,Scopus

MAM represent both a hot spot in cancer onset and progression and an Achilles’ heel of cancer cells that can be exploited for therapeutic perspectives. Over the past years, an increasing number of cancer-related proteins, including oncogenes and tumor suppressors, have been localized in MAM and exert their pro- or antiapoptotic functions through the regulation of Ca 2+ transfer and signaling between the two organelles.

However, following paclitaxel-platinum based chemotherapy, tumor recurrence occurs in most ovarian cancer patients. Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer and represents genetic variation fueling tumor adaptation to cytotoxic effects of anticancer drugs. In this study, our Kaplan-Meier analysis including 263 ovarian cancer patients (stages I/II) revealed that high Polo-like kinase (PLK) 1 expression correlates with bad prognosis. To evaluate the role of PLK1 as potential cancer target within a combinatorial trial, we induced strong mitotic arrest in ovarian cancer cell lines by synergistically co-targeting microtubules (paclitaxel) and PLK1 (BI6727) followed by pharmaceutical inhibition of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC/C) using proTAME. In short- and long-term experiments, this triple treatment strongly activated apoptosis in cell lines and primary ovarian cells derived from cancer patients. Mechanistically, BI6727/paclitaxel/proTAME stabilize Cyclin B1 and trigger mitotic arrest, which initiates mitochondrial apoptosis by inactivation of antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, followed by activation of caspase-dependent effector pathways. This triple treatment prevented endoreduplication and reduced CIN, two mechanisms that are associated with aggressive tumors and the acquisition of drug resistance. This “two-punch strategy” (strong mitotic arrest followed by blocking mitotic exit) has important implications for developing paclitaxel-based combinatorial treatments in ovarian cancer. © 2019 The Authors",,Article,Scopus

Aim: To study the prevalence of ANA in patients with cervical intraepithelial lesion and invasive cervical cancer. Methods: A total of 205 women who underwent screening for cervical cancer or treatment at the Erasto Gaertner Cancer Hospital in Curitiba - Brazil, were enrolled in the study. Based on their latest cervical colposcopy-guided biopsy results, they were divided into four groups: CIN-I: 19.4%; CIN-II: 24.0%; CIN-III: 24.0%; and invasive cancer: 32.4%. As control were studied 68 healthy controls. ANA was searched by immunofluorescence in Hep-2 cells evaluating the pattern and titer. Results: Controls had 4/68 (5.8%) of ANA positivity and patients with CIN and invasive cancer had 15.1% (p = 0.001). Patients with CIN-I and CIN-II had the same prevalence of ANA as controls (p = 1.0 and p = 0.11 respectively), but not those with CIN-III (p = 0.03) and invasive cancer (p = 0.05).

It has been found to crosstalk with two other major developmental pathways, Hedgehog and Notch, in many embryological development cascades and in maintaining stemness of stem cells Research has shown that all the three pathways are potent in inducing tumorigenesis, driving tumor progression and aiding epithelial to mesenchymal transition in malignant cells, apart from maintaining cancer stem cells population inside the tumor tissue. Cancer stem cells are thought to aid in the process of tumor relapse, as they survive therapy by displaying drug resistance and then repopulating tumor tissues. Hence the role of these crosstalks in cancer is under intensive research. Inhibition of all the three pathways individually have resulted in tumor regression, but not optimally, as treatment failure and cancer relapse have been found to occur. Hence, instead of targeting a single pathway, targeting the crosstalk network could be a better alternative to conventional cancer treatment. Also, elimination of both tumor cells as well as cancer stem cells implies a reduced chance of relapse. Drugs developed to target these crosstalking networks, when used in combinatorial therapy, can potentially increase the efficacy of the therapy to a very large extent. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cancer stem cells; Combination therapy in cancer; Crosstalk; Hedgehog; Notch; Wnt",Review,Scopus

Patients’ characteristics and sequencing data were summarized with descriptive statistics and compared using chi-square test. Among 131 HGSOC patients, 23 had BRCA1 (17.6%) while 5 had BRCA2 (3.8%) mutation. In addition, 9 (6.9%) pathogenic mutations were detected in other genes including BRIP1 (n = 2;1.5%), CHEK2 (n = 2;1.5%), NBN (n = 3;2.3%) and RAD51C (n = 2;1.5%). Factors that predicted for BRCA1/2 mutations were: breast and ovarian cancers in the same patient (p = 0.031), young age of EOC (p = 0.029), menstrual status (p = 0.004) and family history of cancer (p < 0.0001). However, these factors did not predict for mutations in other cancer susceptibility genes. Applying established referral criteria for genetic testing in Serbia will help identify BRCA1/2 mutation carriers but will not help identify mutations in other cancer susceptibility genes. Until better predictors emerge we should be performing wider genetic testing of EOC in order to identify all mutation carriers. © 2019, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Japan Society of Human Genetics.",,Article,Scopus

Method: A population-based web survey for adolescent and young adult cancer survivors including a matched control group. Adolescent and young adult cancer survivors from the population-based Swedish National Cancer Registry from four of the six register holders at Regional Cancer Centers in Sweden. Controls were randomly identified from the Swedish National Population registry, from the same register holders. Result: Of 729 eligible participants, 540 completed the survey i.e. 74% participation rate. The study population included 285 adolescent and young adult cancer survivors and 255 matched controls. None of the participants answered that the survey had a very negative impact on them and a minority of 43 (7.9%) of the 540 responded that they were mildly negatively affected by their participation in the study.

The development of outpatient chemotherapy has increased the working population of patients undergoing cancer therapy. Consequently, a significant number of breast cancer survivors experience physical, psychological, and social problems. This study aimed to clarify differences in concerns among patients with breast cancer receiving outpatient chemotherapy according to their employment status. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with breast cancer undergoing outpatient chemotherapy were recruited. A questionnaire was used to survey the attributes, employment status, and levels of concern in these patients based on the Cancer-chemotherapy Concerns Rating Scale (CCRS). Data from three groups (employed full time, employed part-time, and unemployed) were analyzed using multiple comparison tests. Results: The patients' mean age was (55.1 ± 9.9) years. According to the CCRS findings, the following three parameters differed between the three groups: scores for the items 'I always think about my disease' (employed vs. unemployed, P = 0.005) and 'I can't work (housework/schoolwork)' (employed full time vs. part time, P = 0.045), and scores for the 'self-existence' subscale (employed vs. unemployed, P = 0.024). Conclusions: This study revealed the characteristics of concerns in patients with breast cancer according to their employment status. Being able to continue working is considered to enhance the social health of these patients.

RAI3 immunostaining was typically absent or weakly detectable in the membranes in benign esophageal tissues. RAI3 staining was higher in malignant than in benign esophagus epithelium. High-levels of RAI3 staining were found in 79.2% of interpretable EACs and 55.9% of ESCCs.

Mismatch repair deficiency was associated with tumor development and progression therefore, current study was aimed to investigate MLH1 and MSH2 expression in breast cancer and correlate patients’ clinicopathological factors with status of mismatch repair genes. Material and methods: Breast cancer tissues with adjacent normal tissue along with clinical details were collected during surgery from 80 cases. Immunohistochemistry was performed with primary and secondary antibodies for expressional analysis. Results were analyzed using SPSS version 24. Results: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that both MLH1 and MSH2 were crucial in maintaining DNA repair system and loss of these 2 mismatch repair proteins may lead to adverse outcomes in breast cancer. Statistically significant association was found between loss of MLH1 (P = 0.0004; odds ratio 13.8; 95% confidence interval 4.6-41.1), MSH2 (P = 0.0002; odds ratio 14.0; 95% confidence interval 4.7-42.2) and breast cancer. Statistical analysis demonstrated that MLH1 and MSH2 deficiency may lead breast cancer progression to advanced stage, correlated with tumor focality (MLH1 P = 0.001; MSH2 P = 0.002) and chemotherapy (MLH1 P = 0.01; MSH2 P = 0.04). Presence of CK7, GATA 3, and E cadherin tends to increase in mismatch repair deficient breast cancer. Whereas, no association of mismatch repair deficiency was observed with age, tumor grade, positive lymph nodes, menopause, and ER and/or PR status. Conclusion: Loss of mismatch repair proteins in breast cancer highlights its potential role in DNA repair mechanisms and helps tumor cells to become resistant against chemotherapeutic drugs.

Therefore, we investigated Hispanic mothers’ willingness to communicate with dependent children about her actual or hypothetical advanced cancer diagnosis. Methods: Two focus groups (n = 6 participants) and three one-on-one interviews (n = 3) were conducted in either Spanish or English among adult, Mexican-American mothers with a current cancer diagnosis of any stage residing in US-Mexico border communities. Participants reported their perceived concerns, parenting challenges, and openness to discussing an incurable cancer diagnosis with a dependent child. Audio files were transcribed into English and qualitatively coded using content analysis. Results: Participants, most with breast cancer, ranged in age from 25 to 47. Five had considered the possibility of their own death from advanced cancer and three had previously discussed this with their children. While many expected their children would carry on well without them, seven expressed concern for the emotional/spiritual well-being of their children. Mothers anticipated physical and time-based parenting challenges but wanted the opportunity to focus on themselves and their children in advance of death. All but one would be willing to discuss an advance cancer diagnosis with dependent children; four expressed the value of doing so or the potential harm of abdicating this responsibility.

In 2018, according to national cancer institute, about 609,640 people are expected to die from cancer and about 1,735,350 new patients are expected to be diagnosed with this lethal disease. Nanotechnology has played a significant role in almost every field of life including medical sciences. A controlled and sustained release of drug is much desirable and beneficial when one has to deal with cancer as such drugs do also harm to normal cells. General anticancer drugs, used in chemotherapy, are associated with severe side effects due to high dosage requirements. With the help of nanotechnology, great outcomes for instance, anticancer drug loaded nanofibers, have been achieved in cancer therapy requiring less amount of drug as drug is preserved in these nanofibers for prolonged time. Electrospun nanofibers have very large surface area, controllable pore size and tunable drug release profiles which make these nanofibers promising candidates in medical field. To promote green synthesis of nanofibers, researchers have also used water as an effective solvent instead of toxic chemicals and reduced the environmental burden. This green approach of nanofibers fabrication has a good potential to be used in regenerative medicine including cancer therapy because of environmental friendly characteristics. Though, there are numerous research reports available on the application of nanofibers. To the best of our knowledge, no review paper has been reported solely on the applications of nanofibers for cancer therapy. Therefore, this review paper describes some electrospun nanofibers of pure polymer, blends and block copolymers that have been reported for successful cancer therapy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cancer therapy; Electrospinning; Nanofibers; Polymers",Review,Scopus

In 2018, there were over two million new cases of women breast cancer. Particularly, we tried to extract chitosan from crayfish Procambarus clarkii, Crustacea: Cambaridae, by N-deacetylation of chitin. The chemical structure of chitosan was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Also DDA was calculated from FT-IR and ultraviolet spectrophotometry data. Chitosan nanoparticles were prepared using a ball-milling technique. The as-prepared chitosan nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering as well as zeta potential. The cytotoxicity of chitosan and its nanoparticles (50 and 100 μg/mL) against human breast cancer (SK BR3 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines) was evaluated. MTT assay asserts the significant inhibitory action of both chitosan and its nanoparticles on the proliferation of human breast cancer cells in vitro. Chitosan nanoparticles had more anti-proliferative effects on MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 cell lines than its corresponding chitosan. Although, chitosan nanoparticles, that has higher DDA, had a higher cytotoxic activity against human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 cell lines in vitro. Eventually, chitosan and its nanoparticles can be considered as a promising natural compounds in human breast cancer treatment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Chitosan; Crayfish; Human breast cancer; Nanoparticles; Procambarus clarkii",Article,Scopus

Cancer cells can fuse with many cell types, including stromal cells, epithelial cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been reported to migrate and incorporate into tumor sites during cancer progression. However, the underlying mechanism of stem cell fusion in tumor metastasis has not been fully deciphered. In this research, we established a cell fusion model between lung cancer cells and MSCs in vitro. We found that the hybrid cells showed enhanced metastatic capacity with increased expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, whereas the proliferation ability was inhibited and cell cycle was blocked in the G 0 /G 1 phase with elevated expression of p21, p27, and p53. Moreover, the hybrid cells lost epithelial morphology and exhibited an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) change with downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of N-cadherin, Vimentin, α-SMA and Fibronectin1. Meanwhile, the expressions of EMT transcription factors, including Snail1, Slug, Twist1, Zeb1, and Zeb2, were also increased in hybrid cells. More important, the fusion hybrids acquired stem cell-like properties, which exhibited increased expression stem cell transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Kif4 as well as Bmi1.

Previously, overexpression of the long noncoding ribonucleic acid (RNA) (lncRNA) HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) has been found to be associated with the invasion and metastasis capacities of several epithelial cancers, including cervical cancer. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of HOTAIR in cervical cancer resistance to radiotherapy, we investigated cellular autophagy and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in radioresistant human cervical cancer HeLa cells when HOTAIR was suppressed. HOTAIR levels were quantified in cancerous and noncancerous cervical tissues obtained from 108 patients with cervical cancer. Next, we inhibited HOTAIR by RNA interference and activated the Wnt signaling pathway by LiCl in radioresistant HeLa cells to investigate the regulatory mechanisms for the HOTAIR mediating Wnt signaling pathway. We determined that the upregulated HOTAIR may contribute to cervical cancer progression. We found that the short interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of HOTAIR disturbed the Wnt signaling pathway, reduced autophagy, inhibited EMT, decreased cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis in radioresistant HeLa cells. It is worthy to note that the combination treatment of siRNA-HOTAIR and LiCl demonstrated that the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is responsible for the beneficial effect of HOTAIR knockdown in enhancing sensitivity to radiotherapy in radioresistant HeLa cells. Together, our results revealed an important role of HOTAIR in regulating cervical cancer resistance to radiotherapy. Functional suppression of HOTAIR could enhance sensitivity to radiotherapy by reduction of autophagy and reversal of EMT through the suppression of the Wnt signaling pathway. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","autophagy; cervical cancer; epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT); HOTAIR; proliferation; Wnt signaling pathway",Article,Scopus

Cancerous transformation has several causes one of which is dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) expression. Exosomes can transfer miRNAs to neighboring and distant cells. Thus, exosomal miRNAs can transfer cancerous phenotype to distant cells. We used gene expression omnibus (GEO) datasets and miRNA target prediction tools to find overexpressed miRNA in breast cancer cells and their target genes, respectively. Exosomes were extracted from MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells and characterized. Overexpression of the miRNAs of MDA-MB-231 cells and their exosomes were analyzed using quantitative Real-time PCR. The target genes expression was also evaluated in the cell lines. Luciferase assay was performed to confirm the miRNAs: mRNAs interactions. Finally, MCF-7 cells were treated with MDA-MB-231 cells’ exosomes. The target genes expression was evaluated in the recipient cells. GSE60714 results indicated that miR-9 and miR-155 were among the overexpressed miRNAs in highly metastatic triple negative breast cancer cells and their exosomes. Bioinformatic studies showed that these two miRNAs target PTEN and DUSP14 tumor suppressor genes. Quantitative Real-time PCR confirmed the overexpression of the miRNAs and downregulation of their targets. Luciferase assay confirmed that the miRNAs target PTEN and DUSP14. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with MDA-MB-231 cells’ exosomes resulted in target genes downregulation in MCF-7 cells. We found that miR-9 and miR-155 were enriched in metastatic breast cancer exosomes.

This study aimed to explore the regulatory relationship among lncRNA NCK1-AS1, miR-134-5p, and MutS protein homolog 2 (MSH2), so that the resistance against cisplatin in cervical cancer treatment could be better understood. Comprehensive lncRNA profiling analysis was performed to screen lncRNAs differentially expressed in cervical cancer. The expression patterns of miR-134-5p, NCK1-AS1, and MSH2 were evaluated in cancerous tissues and adjacent normal tissues obtained from 75 cervical cancer patients. Subsequently, anti-NCK1-AS1 small interfering RNA, miR-134-5p mimics, and miR-134-5p inhibitors were transfected into cervical cancer cells, and the effects of these transcripts on cisplatin resistance and cell apoptosis were investigated. The regulatory relationship among NCK1-AS1, miR-134-5p, and MSH2 was identified using a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, and the results were further validated by RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Based on the microarray data of GSE63514 and GSE27678, NCK1-AS1 was upregulated in cervical cancer. Increased expression of NCK1-AS1, MSH2, and decreased expression of miR-134-5p were observed in cervical cancer tissues. In addition, NCK1-AS1 competitively bound to miR-134-5p to regulate MSH2. Therefore, si-NCK1-AS1 and miR-134-5p mimic both reduced MSH2 activity and increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis in cervical cancer cells.

Methods: A case-cohort study was conducted, based on 2165 female breast cancer survivors recruited from “Leumit” healthcare fund, who were diagnosed with primary nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer between 2002 and 2012. A 20% random subcohort was sampled at baseline, and all CVD cases were identified. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by weighted Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Of 2165 breast cancer survivors, 466 developed CVD over a mean follow-up of 5.7 years. The crude cumulative incidence of CVD accounting for death as a competing risk was 33.6% (95% CI, 29.6–37.6%) at 13 years of follow-up. Lifestyle components, collected post-CVD incidence, indicated a higher prevalence of poor nutrition and physical inactivity in CVD patients. In multivariable analyses, CVD was positively associated with radiotherapy without chemotherapy compared to no radiotherapy or chemotherapy (HR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.17–7.38; p =.022), outpatient visits (HR per average 10-annual visits, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.50–2.31; p <.001), employment transition between breast cancer diagnosis and treatment: job loss versus no change (HR, 29.62; 95% CI, 12.72–68.97; p <.001), and inversely associated with education (HR per 1-year increment, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75–0.94; p =.003). Conclusions: Radiotherapy administered as an adjuvant treatment for breast cancer elevates the risk of CVD. Preventive strategies should be directed to surveillance for radiotherapy-related CVD dysfunction.

During tumour development, all sFRP (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) genes are hypermethylated, causing transcriptional silencing. sFRPs have an ability to sensitize tumour cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, enhancing cell death. Reduced Wnt signalling is associated with loss of cancer stem cell (CSC) viability. We investigated the possible involvement of methylation-mediated silencing of the sFRP gene family in CSCs derived from breast, prostate, and ovarian tumour cell lines. Real-time RT-PCR studies indicated that loss or downregulation of sFRP (1-5) expression in tumours is associated with promoter hypermethylation. Additionally, CSCs derived from all tumour cell lines with sFRP (1-5) promotor hypermethylation expressed sFRP (1-5) mRNA after treatment with 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza), especially sFRP4, implying that DNA methylation is the predominant epigenetic mechanism for sFRP (1-5) silencing. Furthermore, post-translational modification (PTM) in total and histone proteins was observed post 5-Aza and sFRP4 treatment. Protein levels of Wnt downstream signalling components (GSK3β active β-catenin, and phospho β-catenin) and epigenetic factors of histones (acetyl histone H3, and H3K27me3) affecting PTM were analysed. Our findings suggest that downregulation of sFRP4 expression in endocrine-related cancers can be attributed to aberrant promoter hypermethylation in conjugation with histone modification, and indicate the important role of methylation-induced gene silencing of sFRP4 in survival and proliferation of CSCs derived from these cancers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cancer stem cells; DNA methylation; Epigenetics; Histone modification; Secreted fizzled-related protein; Wnt signalling pathways",Article,Scopus

The morbidity and mortality associated with advanced disease, as well as the emergence of multi-drug resistant variants, highlights the urgency to develop novel therapeutic agents. Artesunate (ART) is a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin from the Chinese herb sweet wormwood. ART is widely used in the treatment of malaria and is well tolerated by patients. Importantly, ART also has anti-cancer activities and may therefore represent a less toxic alternative to conventional chemotherapy. In this study, we demonstrate a dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect of ART on the growth of triple-negative MDA-MB-468 and HER2-enriched SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells, which was the result of both anti-proliferative and cytotoxic activities. ART inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent G2/M arrest and ROS-independent G1 arrest. ART-treated MDA-MB-468 and SK-BR-3 cells also experienced apoptotic cell death, which was both ROS- and iron-dependent. ART-induced oxidative stress caused the loss of mitochondrial outer membrane integrity and damage to the cellular DNA of MDA-MB-468 and SK-BR-3 cells. In addition, exposure to low-dose ART sensitized MDA-MB-468 and SK-BR-3 cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.

Cancer cells reprogram their metabolic pathways to increase nutrients uptake, which has already been a hallmark of cancer. But the effect of TPT on metabolism in gastric cancer remains unknown. Purpose: To investigate the effect of TPT on metabolism in gastric cancer. Methods: ATP production was measured by ATP Assay kit. Glucose and glutamine uptake were measured by Glucose (HK) Assay Kit and Glutamine/Glutamate Determination Kit respectively. To detect glutathione (GSH) concentration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, GSH and GSSG Assay Kit and ROS Assay Kit were adopted. Apoptosis rates, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were determined by flow cytometry and protein levels were analyzed by immumohistochemical staining and western blotting. Results: TPT increased ATP production. TPT promoted glucose uptake possibly via up-regulation of hexokinase 2 (HK2) or glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression, while decreased glutamine uptake by down-regulation of ASCT2 expression. ASCT2 inhibitor GPNA and ASCT2 knockdown significantly suppressed the growth of gastric cancer cells. Inhibition of ASCT2 reduced glutamine uptake which led to decreased production of GSH and increased ROS level. ASCT2 knockdown induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway and weakened anti-cancer effect of TPT. Conclusion: TPT inhibits glutamine uptake via down-regulation of ASCT2 which causes oxidative stress and induces apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway.

We assessed the long-term outcomes of breast cancer ≤2 cm treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and stratified according to an immunohistochemically (IHC)-based subtype definition. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted from a prospectively collected database. Included patients had pT1, any N, M0 breast cancer after BCS (without anti-HER2 therapy) and available information on estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2 status, Ki-67 index. Five IHC-defined subtypes were identified: luminal A-like (ER and/or PR-positive/HER2-negative/Ki-67 < 20%), luminal B-like/HER2-negative (ER and/or PR-positive/HER2-negative/Ki-67 ≥ 20%), luminal B-like/HER2-positive (ER and/or PR-positive/HER2-positive/any Ki-67 value), HER2-positive/nonluminal (ER and PR-negative/HER2-positive), and triple-negative (ER and PR-negative/HER2-negative). Results: We analyzed 184 (65%) luminal A-like, 57 (20%) luminal B-like/HER2-negative, 17 (6%) luminal B-like/HER2-positive, 6 (2%) HER2-positive/nonluminal, and 18 (7%) triple-negative patients. Median follow-up was 112 (interquartile range 94-125) mo. The cumulative 5- and 10-y local recurrence (LR) rates were 1.5% and 4%, respectively. The cumulative 5- and 10-y distant recurrence (DR) rates were 3% and 8%, respectively. The Cox regression revealed that HER2-positive/nonluminal subtypes had the highest risk of LR (P = 0.0025). The luminal B-like/HER2-positive subtypes had the highest risk of DR (P = 0.0019). HER2 positivity carried a higher risk of DR in women with luminal breast cancer who completed 5 y of adjuvant hormonal therapy (P = 0.02). Conclusions: The IHC-defined subtype impacts on the prognosis of breast cancer ≤2 cm after BCS, determining significant differences in LR and DR rates. In the pre–“anti-HER2 therapy” era, patients with HER2-positive/nonluminal or luminal B-like/HER2-positive subtype had worse long-term outcomes than those with luminal A-like subtype. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Breast; Cancer; Immunohistochemistry; Outcome; Phenotype",Article,Scopus

In the present study, the Ras homologue GTPase activation protein 6 (ARHGAP6), which belongs to the Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) family, was found to have low expression in tumor tissues from patients with lung cancer, accompanied by high expression of matrix metal-loproteinase-9 (MMP9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In A549 and H1299 cells, upregulation of ARHGAP6 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis and reduced the levels of MMP9, VEGF and p-STAT3, while the levels STAT3 were unchanged, as demonstrated by CCK-8, migration and invasion assays as well as western blot analysis. In addition, interleukin 6 (IL-6)-induced migration, invasion and MMP9 and VEGF expression, and STAT3 signaling activity were suppressed by ARHGAP6 upregulation. Based on these data, we concluded that ARHGAP6 is critically important in lung cancer progression and that upregulation of ARHGAP6 benefits the treatment and prevention of lung cancer, possibly through the suppression of MMP9, VEGF and STAT3 signaling activation. © 2019 Spandidos Publications.

We reported here that cRGD target liposome delivery system was capable to promote the immunogenic cell death through enhanced potency of a thymidine conjugate post UVA activation as a cancer vaccine. Liposomes and cRGD target liposomes were found to significantly increase the cellular accumulation of the thymidine conjugate and subsequently translated into enhanced cytotoxic potency after UVA activation. More importantly, cRGD target liposomes of the thymidine conjugate markedly promoted the early detection of immunogenic cell death markers including ATP, HMGB1 and calreticulin. Subsequent in vivo vaccination−challenge study confirmed effective tumor growth inhibition by the cRGD liposomal thymidine conjugate and UVA treated cancer cells as the cancer vaccine.

In this study, we explored whether XIST can affect cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis in bladder cancer. The influences of XIST on the cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis were detected in bladder cancer cells. The effect of XIST on the migration of bladder cancer cells was examined by cell migration assay. Through RNA immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, the binding relationship between XIST and TET1 and the regulatory mechanism of TET1 on p53 were examined. Western blot was performed to detect p53 after knockdown or overexpression of XIST. We found that knockdown of XIST suppressed cell migration and proliferation in vitro.

This conspicuous effort has led to the development of successful immunotherapy treatment strategies, whose medical impact has been recognized by the awarding of 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to the two pioneers of check point inhibitor research, Tasuku Honjo and James Allison. Despite these promising achievements, the differences in the clinical response rate in different cancer patients and the high risk of toxicity of immune-based therapies represent crucial challenges. More remarkably, the causes responsible for different outcome (success vs failure) in patients with tumor having same histotype and clinical characteristics remain mostly unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small regulatory noncoding RNA molecules representing the most studied component of the dark matter of the human genome, are involved in the regulation of many pathways of cancer and immune cells. Therefore, understanding the role of miRNAs in controlling cancer immunity is necessary, as it can contribute to reveal mechanisms that can be modulated to improve the success of immunetherapy in cancer patients.

This study explores and describes experiences of everyday life of young children with cancer, over a three year period from diagnosis. Method: This is a longitudinal, inductive interview study with young children with cancer, and their parents. Interviews from shortly after diagnosis, six and 12 months after diagnosis have been reanalysed. Interviews with the same children and their parents from 18 to 36 months after diagnosis have been analysed for the first time in the present paper. A longitudinal temporal analysis at category level for five synchronic data sets forms the basis for the results. Results: The child living with cancer over a three year period is described as a child apart, striving to live an everyday life. This description is built on three categories: I want to be a child like any other, I need security and control and I feel lonely and left out. Young children with cancer actively strive to understand their illness, participate in care and live an ordinary everyday life- but with ongoing feelings of social isolation and loneliness. Conclusions: Young children with cancer need access to and ongoing contact with peers and preschool.

Endometrial cancer is among the most prevalent with 63,320 estimated new cases and approximately 11,350 deaths, followed by ovarian cancer with an estimate of 22,000 new cases and 14,000 deaths annually. Obesity is one of the most modifiable risk factors. Providers should engage in a multifaceted approach to patient education and healthcare to decrease the projected cases of obesity-related cancers. Background: The literature demonstrates a significant link between obesity and the development of certain malignancies such as endometrial, pancreatic, and renal cancer. Specific mechanisms found to play a role in the development of these malignancies include alterations of the metabolic pathway attributed to lipid accumulation as well as a chronic inflammatory process. Obesity also predisposes patients to other medical comorbidities as well as a poorer prognosis once a diagnosis of cancer is established. Factors contributing to poorer prognosis include challenges with treatment planning, specifically pertaining to inappropriate chemotherapy dosing and delivery of radiation therapy. Surgical approach and perioperative management are similarly challenging in obese patients and are associated with increased risk of complications. Conclusion: Obesity is a modifiable factor which is associated with an increased risk of cancer and poorer outcomes. Providers should educate patients on all health hazards of obesity, including increased risk of cancer, and encourage them to participate in a structured weight loss plan. © 2018","Cause-specific mortality; Challenges of obesity; Obesity epidemic; Obesity-related cancers; Postmenopausal breast cancer",Short Survey,Scopus

However, its expression and potential functional role(s) in lung cancer progression have not been fully understood. To evaluate the relationship between the expression of TRIM32 and the prognosis of patients with lung cancer, an independent data set (The Human Protein Atlas website) was introduced. The expression and function analysis of TRIM32 in lung cancer cell lines were also performed by using cell counting kit-8, flow cytometry, transwell, real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Our data showed that TRIM32 was overexpressed in lung cancer tissues and cell lines and was associated with a poor prognosis. TRIM32 silencing inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, and the activation of janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. The results showed knockdown of TRIM32 in NCI-H446 cells also inhibited cell growth in nude mice in the xenograft model. Additionally, TRIM32 overexpression promoted lung cancer cell proliferation and motility and mediated the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 were inhibited by JAK2/STAT3 signaling inhibitor (AG490). Taken together, our findings suggest that TRIM32 may regulate lung cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, and motility through activating the JAK2/STAT3-signaling pathway and may be a novel and promising target for lung cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","apoptosis; JAK2/STAT3; lung cancer; motility; TRIM32",Article,Scopus

Previous study has demonstrated that knockdown of EpCAM inhibits breast cancer cell growth and metastasis via inhibition of the Ras/Raf/ERK signaling pathway and matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9). Although glycosylation is believed to be associated with the function of EpCAM, the contribution of N-glycosylation to this function remains unclear. We constructed the N-glycosylation mutation plasmid of EpCAM and used it to treat breast cancer cells. Loss of N-glycosylation at all three sites EpCAM had no effect on its level of expression or membrane localization. However, mutation at glycosylation sites significantly reduced the ability of EpCAM to promote epithelial to mesenchymal transition in breast cancer. N-glycosylation mutation of EpCAM led to decrease phosphorylation of Raf, ERK, and Akt, and inhibited the Ras/Raf/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrated that N-glycosylation mutation of EpCAM-mediated invasion and metastasis of breast carcinoma cells required the downregulation of MMP-9 via inhibition of these two signaling pathways. Our results identified the characteristics and function of EpCAM glycosylation.

Recent developments in cancer immunotherapy have shown exciting therapeutic promise for metastatic patients. While most therapies target T cells, other immune cells, such as monocytes, hold great promise for therapeutic intervention. In our study, we provide primary evidence of direct engagement between human monocytes and tumor cells in a 3D vascularized microfluidic model. We first characterize the novel application of our model to investigate and visualize at high resolution the evolution of monocytes as they migrate from the intravascular to the extravascular micro-environment. We also demonstrate their differentiation into macrophages in our all-human model. Our model replicates physiological differences between different monocyte subsets. In particular, we report that inflammatory, but not patrolling, monocytes rely on actomyosin based motility. Finally, we exploit this platform to study the effect of monocytes, at different stages of their life cycle, on cancer cell extravasation. Our data demonstrates that monocytes can directly reduce cancer cell extravasation in a non-contact dependent manner. In contrast, we see little effect of monocytes on cancer cell extravasation once monocytes transmigrate through the vasculature and are macrophage-like. Taken together, our study brings novel insight into the role of monocytes in cancer cell extravasation, which is an important step in the metastatic cascade. These findings establish our microfluidic platform as a powerful tool to investigate the characteristics and function of monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages in normal and diseased states. We propose that monocyte-cancer cell interactions could be targeted to potentiate the anti-metastatic effect we observe in vitro, possibly expanding the milieu of immunotherapies available to tame metastasis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cancer cell extravasation; Cancer immunotherapy; Cancer metastasis; Microfluidic models; Monocyte extravasation; Monocyte to macrophage differentiation",Article,Scopus

To define the useful prognostic markers for progression, we analyzed the immunohistochemical expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN), Her2/neu, and E2F1 in 60 cases of NMIBC who underwent TURBT and adjuvant intravesical bacillus-Calmette-Guérin (BCG). Their predicting role for tumor recurrence, progression, recurrence-free survival (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was analyzed. High FASN expression was observed in 56.7% (34/60) of NMIBC cases, and FASN expression was significantly associated with the tumor size, grade, and tumor stage (p = 0.003, p < 0.001, p < 0.0001 respectively). Positive Her2/neu was noted in 18.3% (11/60) of the cases, and its expression was significantly associated with the tumor size, histologic grade, and tumor stage (p = 0.001, p = 0.002, p = 0.011 respectively). High E2F1 expression was detected in 40% of the cases, and it was associated with tumor size, histologic grade, and tumor stage (p < 0.001 for each). Analysis of follow-up period revealed that NMIBC with high FASN, positive Her2/neu, and high E2F1 expression exhibited a potent relation with tumor progression, shorter RFS, and poor PFS. Conclusions: High FASN, Her2/neu, and E2F1 are considered as adverse prognostic factors of tumor recurrence and progression in NMIBC and these patients should be followed carefully. Therefore, we suggest that FASN, Her2/neu, and E2F1 should be considered and evaluated during the selection of the appropriate management strategy for NMIBC patients. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","E2F1; FASN; Her2/neu; Immunohistochemistry; Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer; Prognostic markers",Article,Scopus

As a novel tumor suppressor, depletion of NCOA5 is associated with the development of a variety of tumors, but its function in cervical cancer is currently unclear. In this study, we addressed how expression of NCOA5 changed in the development of human cervical cancer and its association with clinicopathological features, prognosis, and biology characteristics of cervical cancer. Analysis of the microarrays in the Oncomine database indicated that NCOA5 expression was lower in human cervical squamous cell carcinoma tissues than that in normal cervical tissues. That was corroborated by our experiments using fresh tissues: the expression levels of NCOA5 messenger RNA and protein were both significantly decreased in cervical cancer tissues compared with paired adjacent nontumor tissues (P < 0.01). Low expression of NCOA5 is associated with the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage (P = 0.043) and histological grade (P = 0.018) of human cervical cancer. In addition, patients possessing low NCOA5 expression had poorer prognosis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that low NCOA5 expression may be an independent prognostic factor for poorer overall survival in cervical cancer. Further, downregulation of NCOA5 expression results in a significant increase in proliferation, migration, and invasion of HeLa cells. Data of xenograft tumor on BALB/c nude mice manifested that HeLa cells with low NCOA5 expression tend to form larger tumors than negative control ones. In contrast, overexpression of NCOA5 expression leads to the opposite results. Finally, we found that NCOA5 might affect the biological function of human cervical cancer cells by mediating the notch3 signaling pathway. These findings suggest that NCOA5 acts as a tumor suppressor to inhibit tumorigenicity, migration, and invasion, and thus represents a potential novel prognostic marker for overall survival in cervical cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cervical cancer; notch3; nuclear receptor coactivator 5; oncogenesis; Oncomine database; poor prognosis",Article,Scopus

TAMs have become increasingly recognised as a cancer therapy target, such as in combination therapy with an immunity checkpoint inhibitor. However, the clinical and prognostic features of TAMs, and the relationship between TAMs and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), remain unexplored in oesophageal cancer. Methods: Using a non-biased database of 305 resected oesophageal cancer preparations, we evaluated the expression of two M2-like macrophage markers (CD163 and CD204) and PD-L1 on tumour cells by immunostaining. Through in vitro assays, we examined how TAMs influence phenotypic malignancy and PD-L1 expression. Results: High density of CD163 (n = 160) or CD204 (n = 146) was associated with significantly worse overall survival than low expression (log rank P = 0.0025 and 0.018 for CD163 and CD204, respectively). The prognostic effect of TAMs was not significantly modified by any clinical factors (P > 0.05 for all interactions). High TAM density was significantly associated with increased PD-L1 expression. In in vitro assays, cell invasion and migration ability were significantly more upregulated in oesophageal cancer cell lines cocultured with activated macrophages than in control cell lines. Coculture with activated macrophages elevated the PD-L1 expression in cancer cells. Conclusions: High TAM density in oesophageal cancer tissues was associated with shorter survival, suggesting a prognostic biomarker role for TAMs. TAMs also increase PD-L1 expression in tumour cells. Given the significant interest in cancer immunotherapies targeting TAMs and PD-L1, the current findings should have considerable clinical implications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Oesophageal cancer; PD-L1; Prognosis; TAM",Article,Scopus

The purpose of this study is to describe colorectal cancer incidence patterns and trends in the province 2004–2013. Methods: Data on CRC cases were obtained from the Golestan Population-based Cancer Registry (GPCR). The GPCR is a high-quality cancer registry that collects data on primary cancers according to internationally accepted standard protocols. Age-standardized Incidence rates (ASR) were calculated and the 10-year trend quantified using the average annual percentage change (AAPC) from Joinpoint regressions. Results: The overall ASR of CRC were higher in men (14.8 per 100,000 person-years) and the urban populations (35.4), relative to women (11.5) and the rural populations (17.1), respectively. The overall incidence rate was observed to significantly increase 2004–2013 in men (AAPC = 7.3; 95%CI: 2.9–11.8) and women (AAPC = 6.6; 95%CI: 2.7–10.6). The analysis also showed that urban areas (AAPC = 8.1; 95%CI: 2.4–14.1) had a relatively more rapid increase in rates compared to rural areas (AAPC = 6.9; 95%CI: 2.2–11.7). Conclusions: CRC incidence rates in Golestan have been rising during the most recent decade, with a higher incidence and more rapid increases among men and the urban populations.

Lung cancer survivors have more symptom distress and lower function compared with other cancer survivors; however, few interventions are available to improve health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). Lifestyle risk reduction interventions have improved HR-QOL in other cancer survivors. The purpose of this study was to explore lung cancer survivor perspectives on making behavioral changes in the context of a lifestyle risk reduction intervention. Methods: Twenty-two lung cancer survivors participated in interviews after completing the Healthy Directions (HD) intervention. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using inductive content analysis. Demographic and clinical characteristics were gathered through a survey and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Five main themes were identified: (1) the diagnosis was a motivator for behavior change, (2) participants had to deal with disease consequences, (3) the coach provided guidance, (4) strategies for change were initiated, and (5) social support sustained behavioral changes. Other important subthemes were the coach helped interpret symptoms, which supported self-efficacy and goal setting, and survivors employed self-monitoring behaviors. Several participants found the recommended goals for physical activity were difficult and were discouraged if unable to attain the goal. Findings underscore the need for individualized prescriptions of physical activity, especially for sedentary survivors. Conclusions: Lung cancer survivors described the benefits of coaching to enhance their engagement in behavioral change.

Methods: NCI cancer program status for each department of surgery was identified with publically available data, whereas SSO membership was determined for every faculty member. Academic output measures such as NIH funding, publications, and citations were analyzed in subsets by the type of cancer center (NCI comprehensive cancer center [CCC]; NCI cancer center [NCICC]; and non-NCI center) and SSO membership status. Results: Of the surgical faculty, 2537 surgeons (61.9%) were from CCC, whereas 854 (20.8%) were from NCICC. At the CCC, 22.7% of surgeons had a history of or current NIH funding, compared with 15.8% at the NCICC and 11.8% at the non-NCI centers. The academic output of SSO members was higher at NCICC (52 ± 113 publications/1266 ± 3830 citations) and CCC (53 ± 92/1295 ± 4001) compared with nonmembers (NCICC: 26 ± 78/437 ± 2109; CCC: 37 ± 91/670 ± 3260), respectively, P < 0.05. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that SSO membership imparts an additional 22 publications and 270 citations, whereas NCI-designated CCC added 10 additional publications, but not citations. Conclusions: CCCs have significantly higher academic output and NIH funding.

Recent evidence highlights the power of the tumor microenvironment to dictate CSC functionality and spatiotemporal regulation that gives rise to tumor heterogeneity. This microenvironmental regulation of CSCs parallels that of normal tissues, whereby resident stem cells reside within specialized microenvironments or ‘niches’, which provide the cellular and molecular signals that wire every aspect of stem cell behavior and fate. The extracellular matrix (ECM), along with its sequestered growth factors, is a fundamental component of the stem cell niche. Pathological ECM remodeling is an established hallmark of cancer, with the ECM a key mediator of metastasis and drug resistance. In this review, we discuss the controversial identity of CSCs and new understanding of the impact of tumor microenvironment on CSC function and phenotype. We outline parallels between development, wound repair and cancer to discuss how changes in ECM dynamics influence stem cell function during normal physiological processes and pathological states, as well as the transition between the two in the form of precancerous lesions. We then explore examples illustrating the molecular circuits partnering cancer cells with stromal cells and how this communication involving ECM imparts a CSC phenotype and promotes chemoresistance. Understanding the mechanisms underlying CSC functionality and chemoresistance, along with mathematical modeling approaches and advancing technologies for targeting the undruggable proteome, should open opportunities for cancer breakthroughs in the future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Breast cancer; Cancer; Chemoresistance; CSCs; Drug resistance; ECM; EMT; Epidermolysis bullosa; Extracellular matrix; Glioblastoma; Ovarian cancer; Squamous cell carcinoma; Stem cells; Tumor microenvironment",Article,Scopus

Sinomenine has been reported to exhibit anti-tumor effect on various cancers, but the function of Sinomenine in prostate cancer remains unclear. The study aimed to explore the effect of Sinomenine on proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion in prostate cancer cells. Methods PC3 cells were stimulated by different concentrations of Sinomenine, then cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis were examined by CCK-8, BrdU, Transwell and flow cytometry, respectively. Subsequently, miR-23a mimic and miR-23a inhibitor were transfected into PC3 and LNCaP cells, cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were reassessed in these transfected cells. The related factors of cell cycle, apoptosis, metastasis and PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT signal pathways were measured by western blot. Results Sinomenine significantly suppressed cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis and inhibited migration and invasion, as well as down-regulated Cyclin D1, CDK4, Bcl-2, MMP-2, MMP-9, Vimentin protein levels and up-regulated p16 and Bax protein levels in PC3 cells. Additionally, Sinomenine decreased the expression level of miR-23a, and overexpression of miR-23a reversed the effects of Sinomenine on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion in PC3 and LNCaP cells. Further, Sinomenine inactivated PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT signal pathways by regulation of miR-23a. Conclusions The data suggested that Sinomenine could suppress cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and promote apoptosis of prostate cancer cells through regulation of miR-23a.

Despite this, it is recognised that a range of patients’ psychological and emotional needs remain unmet, both at the time of treatment and into survivorship. Using data from two distinct cohorts of women: those treated with radiotherapy for breast cancer historically, and women treated more recently, this study sought to identify and explore those needs and concerns that have continued to persist, despite advances in treatment and care. Method: Data from N = 13 semi-structured interviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. An heuristic framework was applied to extract themes common to both participant cohorts. Results: Participants’ data evidenced an enduring vulnerability amongst cancer patients that has not diminished with new treatment pathways. Themes common to both cohorts highlighted the ongoing importance of personal factors such as resilience, and strategies to help retain a sense of normality. Extrinsic support was important too, especially high quality communication by healthcare professionals and having access to ongoing emotional support from others, particularly when active treatment ends. Participants’ suggestions for future service development included the provision of ongoing continuity of care and greater access to emotional support services. Conclusions: This study highlights the psychological needs and concerns of breast cancer patients that have persisted, despite the many advances in patient-centred care. Findings are of value to nurses and other healthcare professionals in highlighting the ongoing importance of recognising, acknowledging and addressing patients’ concerns and needs, even within current cancer care pathways. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Breast cancer; Cancer late-effects; Cancer survivorship; Qualitative; Radiotherapy",Article,Scopus

We examined the association between MD adherence and pancreatic cancer incidence by pooling data from the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS, 120,852 subjects) and the Dutch cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-NL, 40,011 subjects). MD adherence was assessed using alternate and modified Mediterranean diet scores (aMED and mMED, respectively), including and excluding alcohol. After median follow-ups of 20.3 (NLCS) and 19.2 (EPIC-NL) years, 449 microscopically confirmed pancreatic cancer (MCPC) cases were included in study-specific multivariable Cox models. Study-specific estimates were pooled using a random-effects model. MD adherence was not significantly associated with MCPC risk in pooled and study-specific analyses, regardless of sex and MD score. Pooled hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for high (6–8) compared to low (0–3) values of mMED excluding alcohol were 0.66 (0.40–1.10) in men and 0.94 (0.63–1.40) in women. In never smokers, mMED excluding alcohol seemed to be inversely associated with MCPC risk (nonsignificant). However, no association was observed in ever smokers (p heterogeneity = 0.03). Hazard ratios were consistent across strata of other potential effect modifiers. Considering MD scores excluding alcohol, mMED-containing models generally fitted better than aMED-containing models, particularly in men. Although associations somewhat differed when all pancreatic cancers were considered instead of MCPC, the overall conclusion was similar. In conclusion, MD adherence was not associated with pancreatic cancer risk in a pooled analysis of two Dutch cohorts. © 2018 The Authors.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey of adult haematological cancer outpatients was conducted. Participants completed two pen-and-paper questionnaires: the first examined demographics and disease characteristics; the second, completed four weeks later, asked about the cancer information received. Participants indicated whether they received the information they needed about medical procedures and self-management, experiences regarding doctor-patient communication, and self-efficacy in seeking information and support. Where possible, items were derived from Australian psychosocial cancer care guidelines. Results: Two hundred and ninety-three (84%) patients consented to participate, with 170 (58%) completing both questionnaires. Most participants reported receiving information in accordance with guidelines. Areas identified as requiring improvement included difficulty recalling information (28%); information overload (26%); insufficient opportunity to ask questions (23%); and insufficient information about managing anxiety related to medical procedures (20%). Conclusion: While many haematological cancer patients report receiving adequate information, there is room for improvement. Implementation of evidence-based strategies, such as decision aids or audiotapes of the consultation, may help to improve information experiences.

Little is known, however, about the phototoxic properties of curcumin, as a natural phenolic compound, against different types of cancers. It is generally accepted that cellular damage occurs during photo treatment. There is a limitation in using of curcumin as a drug due to its low solubility, but nanoparticles such as anionic nanoclays or layered double hydroxide (LDH) could overcome it. The aim of this study was to investigate cellular responses to curcumin-LDH nanoparticles after photodynamic treatment of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. For this purpose, the MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line treated with curcumin-LDH nanoparticle and then irradiated (photodynamic treatment). After irradiation, lactate dehydrogenase assay, clonogenic cell survival, cell death mechanisms such as autophagy and apoptosis were determined. Cell cycle distribution after photodynamic therapy (PDT) and also intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were measured. The result showed that curcumin-LDH–PDT has a cytotoxic and antiprolifrative effect on MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Curcumin-LDH–PDT induced autophagy, apoptosis, and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in human breast cancer cell line. Intracellular ROS increased in MDA-MB-231 cancer cell line after treatment with curcumin-LDH along with irradiation. The results suggest that curcumin-LDH nanoparticle could be considered as a novel approach in the photodynamic treatment of breast cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","apoptosis; autophagy; curcumin-layered double hydroxide nanohybrid; photodynamic therapy; reactive oxygen species; triple-negative breast cancer",Article,Scopus

Moreover, attempts to utilize these alterations for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment have been made. The prostate cancer metabolism and biosynthesis of amino acids are particularly focused on anaplerosis more than on energy production. Other crucial requirements on amino acids pool come from the serine, one‑carbon cycle, glycine synthesis pathway and folate metabolism forming major sources of interproducts for synthesis of nucleobases necessary for rapidly proliferating cells. Considering the lack of some amino acids biosynthetic pathways and/or their extraordinary importance for prostate cancer cells, there is a widespread potential for targeted therapeutic applications with no effect on non-malignant cells.

However, the underlying molecular mechanism of the unparalleled carcinogenic power of HPV16 compared to other types of high-risk (HR)-HPV including HPV18 remains elusive. The PDZ binding motif (PBM) of high-risk HPV E6 plays an important role in neoplasia and progression of cervical cancer. HPV16 E6 rather than HPV18 E6, interacted with NHERF1 by its PBM region, and induced degradation of NHERF1. NHERF1 retarded the assembly of cytoskeleton by downregulation of ACTN4, thereby inhibited the migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells in both cell and mouse model. HPV16 E6 was confirmed to enhance actin polymerization with increased ACTN4 level by downregulation of NHERF1, and result in enhanced migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells. GSEA analysis of cervical cancer specimens also showed that HPV16 E6 rather than HPV18 E6, was significantly associated with actin cytoskeleton assembly. That downregulation of NHERF1 by HPV16 E6 promoted cytoskeleton assembly and cell invasion, was an important cause in cervical cancer carcinogenesis. These findings provided the differential mechanism between HPV16 E6 and HPV18 E6 in the development and progression of cervical cancer, which may partially explain the differences of carcinogenic power between these two types of HR-HPVs. © 2018 UICC","actin cytoskeleton; EBP50; HPV16; invasion; migration; PDZ; α-actinin 4",Article,Scopus

In this study, an improved cellular neural network (CNN) algorithm is proposed as the solution to detect the cancerous cells in real-time by undergoing the image processing of Pap smear images. A few templates are combined and modified to form an ideal CNN algorithm to detect the cancerous cells in total of 115 Pap smear images.

We have previously discussed basis-dependent quantum selection as a mechanism for directed adaptive mutation, a process in which selective pressure specifically induces mutation in those genes involved in the adaptive response. Tumor progression in cancer easily lends itself to the adaptive evolutionary perspective, as the Darwinian combination of heritable variations together with selection of the better proliferating variants are believed to play a major role in multistep carcinogenesis. Adaptive mutation may play a role in carcinogenesis; accordingly, we propose that the principles of quantum biology are involved in directed adaptive mutation processes that promote tumor formation. In this paper, we discuss the intersection between quantum mechanics, biology, adaptive evolution, and cancer, and present general models by which adaptive mutation may influence neoplastic initiation and progression. As a potential theoretical and experimental model, we use colorectal cancer. Our model of “quantum cancer” suggests experiments to evaluate directed adaptive mutation in tumorigenesis, and may have important implications for cancer therapeutics. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive mutation; Cancer; Decoherence; Density matrix; Quantum mechanics; Wnt signaling",Article,Scopus

Methods: Recruited patients were divided into three groups in terms of tumor anatomic site, including head and neck, thoracic, and abdominal cancers. All of plans were generated using the fixed-beam IMRT and the VMAT techniques. The qualities of the plans were assessed using the conformity index (CI) and the homogeneous index (HI) with respect to the dose delivered to the tumors. Some selected organs-at-risk (OARs) were analyzed. For the efficiency of the plan, monitor units (MUs) were compared between the paired plans. All parameters were collected and evaluated based on the conventional dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the paired plans. All BED were calculated from the physical dose. Results: For CI and HI, the fixed-beam IMRT and the VMAT gained significant differences (p < 0.05), mainly in the head and neck (HN) group, with the exception of the CI of the plan gross tumor volume (PGTV) in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) site. In the thoracic group, the HI gained significant differences (p < 0.05) in the plans of the lung cancer with the central tumor without lymph node metastasis. The CI gained significant differences (p < 0.05) in the plans of the lung cancer with the surrounding tumor without lymph node metastasis. The MUs were higher in the VMAT plans compared with the fixed-beam IMRT plans in only two types of cancers. Analysis of the statistical significances regarding the BED values between the fixed-beam IMRT and the VMAT plans were the same as the values of the physical doses when the two paired plans were analyzed.

Previous studies by others indicated that the risks associated with reduced NKX3.1 levels can be enhanced by anti-oxidant supplementation. Selenium is an essential component of several proteins with anti-oxidant functions and lower levels of selenium have been associated with greater risk of prostate cancer. In contrast, participants of the select prostate cancer prevention trial were at increased risk of prostate cancer when supplemented with selenium when their baseline selenium levels were high. Methods: In order to investigate whether there was an interaction between a functional polymorphism in NKX3.1 that results in less protein and selenium status with prostate cancer grade or outcome, plasma selenium levels and the genotypes of NKX3.1 and the selenium carrier protein SELENOP were determined from a cohort of men who underwent radical protatectomy. Results: NKX3.1 and SELENOP genotypes were associated with a more aggressive prostate tumor grade at the time of prostatectomy, but there were no significant interactions of NKX3.1 genotype with either selenium status or SELENOP genotype. There was also a significant association between NKX3.1 genotype and prostate cancer recurrence, however this association was modified by SELENOP genotype, but not with plasma selenium levels. Conclusions: These data indicate that the impact of selenium status on prostate cancer may be influenced by factors other than the amount of selenium in circulation. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","prostatectomy; selenium; selenoproteins",Article,Scopus

Lack of efficient diagnostics and dearth of effective therapeutics that can target the cancer as well as the microenvironment niche are the reasons for limited success in treatment and management of this disease. Cell invasion through extracellular matrix (ECM) involves the complex regulation of adhesion to and detachment from ECM and its understanding is critical to metastatic potential of pancreatic cancer. To understand the characteristics of these cancer cells and their ability to metastasize, we compared human pancreatic cancer cell line, PANC-1 and its invading phenotype (INV) collected from transwell inserts. The invasive cell type, INV, exhibited higher resistance to Carbon-ion radiation compared to whole cultured (normally dish-cultured) PANC-1 (WCC), and had more efficient in vitro spheroid formation capability. Invasiveness of INV was hampered by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors, suggesting that nitric oxide (NO) plays a cardinal role in PANC-1 invasion. In addition, in vitro studies indicated that a MEK-ERK-dependent, JAK independent mechanism through which NOS/NO modulate PANC-1 invasiveness. Suspended INV showed enhanced NO production as well as induction of several pro-metastatic, and stemness-related genes. NOS inhibitor, L-NAME, reduced the expression of these pro-metastatic or stemness-related genes, and dampened spheroid formation ability, suggesting that NO can potentially influence pancreatic cancer aggressiveness. Furthermore, xenograft studies with INV and WCC in NSG mouse model revealed a greater ability of INV compared to WCC, to metastasize to the liver and L-NAME diminished the metastatic lesions in mice injected with INV. Overall, data suggest that NO is a key player associated with resistance to radiation and metastasis of pancreatic cancer; and inhibition of NOS demonstrates therapeutic potential as observed in the animal model by specifically targeting the metastatic cells that harbor stem-like features and are potentially responsible for relapse. © 2019","Cancer stem cell; Invasion; Metastasis; Nitric oxide; Nitric oxide synthase; Pancreatic cancer",Article,Scopus

Materials and methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to determine the extent of distal mesorectal (DMS) and distal intramural spread (DIS), the risk of lateral lymph node (LLN) metastases in pT2 tumours, and regional recurrence pattern after organ preservation. Results: The rate of DMS > 1 cm was 1.9% (95% CI: 0.4–5.4%), maximum extent: 1.3 cm. The rate of DIS > 0.5 cm was 4.7% (95% CI: 1.3–11.5%), maximum extent: 0.8 cm. The rate of LLN metastases was 8.2% (95% CI: 6.7–9.9%) for tumours below or at peritoneal reflexion and 0% for higher tumours. Regional nodal recurrences alone were recorded in 1.0% (95% CI: 0.5–1.7%) of patients after watch-and-wait and in 2.1% (95% CI: 1.2–3.4%) after preoperative radiotherapy and local excision. Thus, the following rules for CTV delineation are proposed: caudal border 1.5 cm from the tumour to account for DMS or 1 cm to account for DIS, whichever is more caudal; cranial border at S2/S3 interspace; inclusion of LLN for tumours at or below peritoneal reflexion. A planning study was performed in eight patients to compare dose–volume parameters obtained using these rules to that obtained using current guidelines for advanced cancers. The proposed rules led to a mean 18% relative reduction of planning target volume, which resulted in better sparing of organs-at-risk. Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests a smaller CTV for cT2 tumours than the current guidelines designed for advanced cancers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Clinical target volume; Organ-preserving treatment; Rectal cancer",Article,Scopus

However, its clinical significance and biological function in endometrial cancer (EMC) remain unclear. Here, we show that UBE2S is upregulated in EMC and exhibits oncogenic activities via activation of SOX6/β-Catenin signaling. High expression of UBE2S is significantly associated with poor prognosis in two independent cohorts consisting of a total of 773 patients with EMC. in vitro studies demonstrate that ectopic expression of UBE2S promotes cell proliferation and migration, whereas knockdown of UBE2S results in opposite phenotypes. Overexpression of UBE2S in EMC cells enhances the nuclear translocation of β-Catenin, and subsequently induces the expression of c-Myc and Cyclin D1. Inhibition of β-Catenin by XAV-939 markedly attenuates UBE2S-promoted cell growth. Mechanistically, UBE2S suppresses the expression of SOX6 to trigger β-Catenin signaling. Re-expression of SOX6 in UBE2S-expressing EMC cells abolishes the nuclear localization of β-Catenin. Collectively, these data suggest UBE2S may serve as a promising prognostic factor and function as an oncogene in EMC.

Results: Among the evaluated compounds, only kahweol acetate and cafestol inhibited the proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. The combination treatment involving kahweol acetate and cafestol synergistically inhibited proliferation and migration (combination index <1) with the induction of apoptosis, the inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and decrease in androgen receptor, resulting in the reduction of nuclear androgen receptor in androgen receptor-positive cells. Moreover, kahweol acetate and cafestol downregulated CCR2 and CCR5 without an increase in their ligands, CCL2 and CCL5.

Methods: The Gene Expression Omnibus database was used for analyzing the differentially expressed lncRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) in bladder cancer tissues, with the highly expressed lncRNA PVT1 and mRNA CDK1 screened out. The expression level of PVT1 was detected by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, cell viability by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, cell proliferation and scratch by 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine assay, cell migration and invasion by transwell assays, the expression level of CDK1 by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis, transcription factor targeting by dual-luciferase assay, and the effect of PVT1 on bladder cancer growth by nude mice tumor formation experiment.

However, its biological function, underlying mechanism and clinical significance in liver cancer remain unknown. In the present study, the effects of OIP5 expression on liver cancer, and the mechanisms regulating these effects, were investigated. OIP5 expression was measured in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and liver cancer cell lines. The effect of OIP5 knockdown on tumorigenesis was also detected in nude mice, and differentially‑expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and their biological functions were identified. The results indicated that OIP5 expression was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and four liver cancer cell lines (P<0.01). Increased OIP5 protein expression significantly predicted reduced survival rate of patients with HCC (P<0.01). OIP5 knockdown resulted in the suppression of proliferation and colony forming abilities, cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 or G2/M phases, and promotion of cell apoptosis. A total of 628 DEGs, including 87 upregulated and 541 downregulated genes, were identified following OIP5 knockdown. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that DEGs were involved in ‘RNA Post‑Transcriptional Modification, Cancer and Organismal Injury and Abnormalities’. Finally, OIP5 knockdown in Huh7 cells dysregulated bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2/JUN/checkpoint kinase 1/Rac family small GTPase 1 expression.

However, IR780 poor water solubility and acute cytotoxicity limit its direct use in cancer theragnostic. Herein, a novel Hyaluronic acid (HA)-based amphiphilic polymer was used, for the first time, in the preparation of polymeric nanoparticles (HPN) encapsulating IR780 aimed to be applied in breast cancer therapy. Furthermore, HPN co-encapsulating IR780 and Doxorubicin (DOX) were also produced in order to further enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of this nanoformulation. The results revealed that HPN were able to successfully encapsulate IR780 (IR-HPN) and the IR780-DOX combination (IR/DOX-HPN). Furthermore, the encapsulation of IR780 in HPN improved its absorption at 808 nm by about 2.2-fold, thereby enhancing its photothermal potential, as well as its cytocompatibility. The 2D in vitro cell uptake studies demonstrated that the nanostructures displayed a higher internalization by breast cancer cells than by normal cells. In addition, the assays performed in 3D in vitro models of breast cancer revealed that HPN can penetrate into spheroids. Furthermore, the 3D in vitro studies also demonstrated that the combined application of IR-HPN and NIR light was unable to induce cytotoxicity on spheroids. In contrast, IR/DOX-HPN produced a decrease on spheroids cells’ viability, and their combination with NIR light induced an even stronger therapeutic effect, thus revealing the potential of these nanoparticles for cancer chemo-phototherapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cancer; Chemotherapy; Doxorubicin; IR780; Photothermal therapy; Polymeric nanoparticles",Article,Scopus

Due to its complexity in nature, effective BC treatment can encounter many challenges. The human RALBP1 gene encodes a 76-kDa splice variant protein, RLIP (ral-binding protein1, RalBP1), a stress-protective mercapturic acid pathway (MAP) transporter protein, that also plays a key role in regulating clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE) as a Ral effector. Growing evidence shows that targeting RLIP may be an effective strategy in cancer therapy, as RLIP is over-expressed in multiple cancers and is known to induce resistance to apoptosis and chemotherapeutic drugs. Recent studies demonstrated that RLIP is expressed in human BC tissues, as well as BC cell lines. Knockdown of RLIP resulted in apoptotic death of BC cells in vitro, and targeted inhibition and depletion of RLIP resulted in regression of BC in xenograft studies of nude mice. Signaling studies showed that RLIP depletion inhibited endocytosis and differentially regulated signaling to Akt, Myc, and ERK1/2. However, the proliferation and multi-specific transport mechanisms that promote RLIP-mediated cell death in BC are not well understood. In this review, we will discuss a missing but an essentially determining and connecting piece of the puzzle on the understanding of proliferation and transport mechanisms by focused analyses of the apoptotic, drug- and radiation-sensitivity regulated by RLIP, a stress-responsive non-ATP-binding cassette (ABC), high capacity MAP transporter, in breast cancer. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Breast cancer; Clathrin-dependent endocytosis; Drug resistance; Glutathione-conjugate transport; RalBP1; RLIP",Review,Scopus

The goal of present study was to verify QA activity to modify the expression of p53 tumor suppressor in colon cancer cells, and to relate it to its cancer cell growth inhibiting activity in vitro. Methods: LS180 colon cancer cells possessing the wild type form of p53 were used in the study. Real-time PCR and immunobloting techniques were used to test the expression of p53 at gene and protein level, respectively. Next, immunocytochemistry was used to visualize the localization of p53 protein within the cells. Furthermore, the antiproliferative activity of QA was retested in cells with siRNA silenced P53 gene. Results: The activity of QA to modify both the expression and phosphorylation of p53 protein as well as the level of P53 gene is shown. Concomitantly, the nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of phospho-p53 protein upon QA treatment is also presented. Moreover, reduced activity of QA in colon cancer cells with silenced p53 expression is observed. Conclusion: QA affects the expression of p53 tumor suppressor, both at gene and protein level.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a register-based algorithm to identify patients with recurrence of breast cancer (BC). Methods: We conducted a cohort study based on data from Danish national health registers and used the Danish National Patient Register and the Danish National Pathology Register as sources to identify BC recurrence. We used data from the Danish Breast Cancer Group (DBCG) validated against medical records on recurrence status and recurrence date for 471 women with early stage unilateral BC as the gold standard of BC recurrence to assess the accuracy of the algorithm to identify BC recurrence. Results: The algorithm displayed a sensitivity of 97.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 93.2–99.3), a specificity of 97.2% (95% CI: 94.8–98.7) and a positive predictive value of 94.4% (95% CI: 89.2–97.3). The concordance correlation coefficient for the agreement between recurrence dates generated by the algorithm and the gold standard was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96-0.98), and the date was estimated within +/−30 days of the gold standard in 66% of the patients and within +/−60 days in 76% of the patients.

In this study, we found that Kras G12D mutation status as determined by ddPCR correlated with high levels of Treg infiltration in resectable pancreatic cancer tissues. Compared to wild-type tumour cells, tumours cells with the Kras G12D mutation were associated with higher levels of Tregs, and knockout of the Kras G12D mutation reversed this effect. In addition, overexpression of the Kras G12D mutation in wild-type Kras tumour cells resulted in conversion of CD4 + CD25 − T cells into Tregs. We also found that in tumour cells, the Kras G12D mutation activated the MEK/ERK pathway, thereby up-regulating the levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), which induced Treg conversion. In summary, Kras G12D mutation plays a critical role in Treg conversion and contributes to an immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment in pancreatic cancer.

Methods: In this meta-analysis study, the PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for English-language publications. seven case-control studies were included in the pooled analysis. Results: These studies were published between 1991 and 2016. The heterogeneity across the studies was significant (P = 0.06, I 2 = 50.4%). The results of the random effects model meta-analysis showed that there was a direct relationship between occupational exposure to wood dust and NPC (OR = 1.5 95% CI: 1.09–2.07). Among different histological subtypes of NPC, there was a significantly increased risk for the nonkeratinizing carcinoma following wood dust exposure (OR = 1.68, 95%CI: 1.03–2.74). We found no evidence of publication bias across studies according to the result of the Egger's test (P of bias = 0.073).

Although overexpression of eukaryotic translation elongation factor eEF1Bα is associated with cancer onset and progression, little is known about its expression in GC and its prognostic significance. Here we used immunohistochemistry to analyze eEF1Bα expression in the following tissue types: GC, normal gastric, chronic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and intraepithelial neoplasia. These data were correlated with patients' clinical information. eEF1Bα was expressed at levels approximately three times higher in GC tissues compared with normal gastric tissues. High expression of eEF1Bα was significantly associated with histological type, TNM stage, tumor size, and distant metastases. GC patients with high eEF1Bα expression experienced significantly shorter overall survival. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that eEF1Bα may be associated with protein synthesis, energy metabolism, cell cycle, and the p53 signaling pathway. We identified the products of RPL10A and RPS13 as critical components of a network comprising eEF1Bα. We concluded that high eEF1Bα expression is associated with poor overall survival and may serve as an independent prognostic factor of GC. Further, we proposed that eEF1Bα likely mediates the development of GC through the cell cycle and p53 signaling pathway. Together, our findings suggest that eEF1Bα could be an effective prognostic biomarker for GC. © 2018 The Authors","Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 Bα; Gastric cancer; Tissue microarray",Article,Scopus

The current study aimed to explore gene expression and methylation differences between LUAD and LUSC. EdgeR was used to identify differentially regulated genes between normal and cancer in the LUAD and LUSC extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), respectively, whereas SAM was used to find genes with differential methylation between normal and cancer in the LUAD and LUSC, respectively. Finally, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis was performed to analyze the function which these genes enriched in. A total of 391 genes with opposite methylation patterns in LUAD and LUSC and four functional pathways were obtained (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.1). These pathways mainly included fat digestion and absorption, phenylalanine metabolism, bile secretion, and so on, which were related to the airframe nutrition metabolic pathway. Moreover, two genes CTSE (cathepsin E) and solute carrier family 5 member 7 (SLC5A7) were also found, among which CTSE was overexpressed and hypomethylated in LUAD corresponding to normal lung tissues, whereas SLC5A7 showed the opposite in LUAD. In conclusion, this study investigated the differences between the gene expression and methylation patterns in LUAD and LUSC, and explored their different biological characteristics.

Social life is even more profoundly affected in advanced diseases, but research on social consequences of advanced cancer is scarce. This study aims to explore social consequences of advanced cancer as experienced by patients and their informal caregivers. Methods: Seven focus groups and seven in-depth semi-structured interviews with patients (n = 18) suffering from advanced cancer and their informal caregivers (n = 15) were conducted. Audiotapes were transcribed verbatim and open coded using a thematic analysis approach. Results: Social consequences were categorized in three themes: “social engagement,” “social identity,” and “social network.” Regarding social engagement, patients and informal caregivers said that they strive for normality by continuing their life as prior to the diagnosis, but experienced barriers in doing so. Regarding social identity, patients and informal caregivers reported feelings of social isolation. The social network became more transparent, and the value of social relations had increased since the diagnosis. Many experienced positive and negative shifts in the quantity and quality of their social relations. Conclusions: Social consequences of advanced cancer are substantial. There appears to be a great risk of social isolation in which responses from social relations play an important role. Empowering patients and informal caregivers to discuss their experienced social consequences is beneficial. Creating awareness among healthcare professionals is essential as they provide social support and anticipate on social problems. Finally, educating social relations regarding the impact of advanced cancer and effective support methods may empower social support systems and reduce feelings of isolation. © 2018, The Author(s).","Advanced cancer; Focus groups; Informal caregivers; Palliative oncology; Social consequences; Social well-being",Article,Scopus

UCNPs emit visible luminescence under near-infrared excitation, producing high-contrast images with no background fluorescence. When coupled with AuNRs, the resulting UCNP-AuNR multifunctional nanoclusters are capable of simultaneous detection and treatment of bladder cancer. These UCNP-AuNR nanoclusters are further functionalized with antibodies to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to target bladder cancer cells known to overexpress EGFRs. This paper demonstrates, for the first time, efficient targeting of bladder cancer cells with UCNP-AuNR nanoclusters. In addition to high-contrast imaging and consequently high sensitivity detection of bladder cancer cells, highly selective optoporation-assisted chemotherapy was accomplished using a dosage of chemotherapy agent significantly lower than any previous reports, within a clinically relevant incubation time window.

Ketamine has been shown to have the capacity to attenuate cancer cells malignancy. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In the present study, we reported that ketamine inhibited the malignant potential of colorectal cancer cells and investigated the possible mechanisms involved. Ketamine suppressed the expression of VEGF, HIF-1α p-AKT, p-ERK, and p-CaMK II, and reduced intracellular Ca 2+ level in a concentration dependent manner (1, 5, 10 μg/ml). Furthermore, AP5 and MK801 (NMDAR inhibitors), and KN93 (CaMK II inhibitor), decreased the expression of VEGF, HIF-1a, p-AKT, p-ERK, and p-CaMK II, which were similar to the effect of ketamine. Further, the anti-tumor effect of ketamine was reversed by D-serine (NMDAR activator). Ketamine did not affect NMDA receptor expression, however knockdown of NMDA receptor using siRNA attenuated the effect of ketamine on cell migration. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that ketamine attenuated the expression of VEGF and cell migration ability in colorectal cancer cells, probably via blockage of NMDA receptor. © 2019","CaMK II; Colorectal cancer cells; Ketamine; NMDA receptor",Article,Scopus

Use of mammography, the main method to diagnose the disease, has several limitations in parts of the population. The primary goal of this work was to detect and localize the geometric centers of mammary tumors using only superficial temperatures of the breast skin. The 2D anatomic geometry of the breast was simulated using the commercial software COMSOL to obtain the distribution of skin temperature in the three main types of breast cancer. Random errors of ± 2% were added to the simulated temperatures. The temperature variation caused by each type of cancer on the healthy tissue was correlated with auxiliary temperature profiles. These auxiliary temperature profiles were obtained with no prior knowledge of the thermophysical properties of the tumor apart from the mean values for thermal conductivity and blood perfusion of the layers of healthy breast tissue. The results showed that the maximum error for geometric center estimation was 0.32 cm for invasive lobular carcinoma, with a diameter of 1 cm, positioned 5 cm from the skin surface. Thus, this work contributes to studies aiming to improve the use of infrared thermography for early breast cancer diagnosis, as the results showed that localization of tumors using only superficial temperature profiles does not require prior knowledge of the thermophysical properties of the tissues. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Breast cancer; Correlation; Infrared thermography; Position estimate; Surface temperatures",Article,Scopus

This study is carried out to identify the most reliable dosimetric predictors for pulmonary complications following NACRT and surgery for esophageal cancer. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 308 patients with esophageal cancer who received surgery following NACRT for locally advanced esophageal cancer from January 2005 to June 2017. Dose–volume histograms (DVH) of both lungs were computed for each patient along with total lung volume, mean lung dose (MLD), V 5 , V 10 , V 20 , and V 30 . The effect of each parameter on postoperative pulmonary complications was estimated in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Postoperative pulmonary complications occurred in 22.1% of all patients. Univariate analysis for pulmonary complications showed that location of tumor (P = 0.017), pre-RT FEV1 (P = 0.003), MLD (P = 0.002), V 5 (P &lt; 0.001), V 10 (P &lt; 0.001), and V 20 (P = 0.007) were all significant risk factors. Significant factors for postoperative pulmonary complications in multivariate analysis were MLD (odds ratio (OR) 1.118, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.025–1.219, P = 0.012) and pre-RT FEV1 (OR 0.483, 95% CI 0.294–0.795, P = 0.004). Conclusions: In patients who received NACRT and surgery for esophageal cancer, MLD was the parameter most related to postoperative pulmonary complications.

Methods: The ICARE study is a large population-based case-control study conducted in France between 2001 and 2007. This present analysis was restricted to men and included 350 and 543 cases of squamous cell-carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx, respectively, and 2780 controls. Lifetime tobacco, alcohol consumption and complete occupational history were assessed through detailed questionnaires. Job-exposure matrices allowed us to assess occupational exposure to five petroleum-based solvents (white spirits; diesel/fuel oils/kerosene; gasoline; benzene; special petroleum products) and five oxygenated solvents (diethyl ether; tetrahydrofuran; ketones and esters; alcohols; ethylene glycol). Odds-ratios (ORs), adjusted for age, smoking, alcohol consumption and socioeconomic status, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using unconditional logistic models. Results: Associations between oral cancer risk and exposure to white spirits and diesel/fuel oils/kerosene were suggested, but there was no exposure-response trend. Concerning exposure to oxygenated solvents, participants with the highest levels of cumulative exposure to diethyl ether had a significant excess risk of oropharyngeal cancer (OR = 7.78, 95%CI 1.42 to 42.59; p for trend = 0.04). Ever exposure to tetrahydrofuran was associated with a borderline significant increased risk of oral cancer (OR = 1.87, 95%CI 0.97 to 3.61), but no exposure-response trend was observed. Additional adjustments for exposure to other solvents did not substantially change the results.

This study aimed to stocktake MCCs for breast cancer in Canadian sites participating in the RUBY cohort study (Reducing the Burden of Breast Cancer in Young Women) to better understand variations in multidisciplinary care across Canada and to add to the international literature. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with surgeons and surgical oncologists representing 34 clinical centres participating in RUBY. Questions were grouped according to: type of multidisciplinary care, implementation, function, practice, participation and presentation, operation, and demographics, and included a mix of Likert-based, tick box and open-ended questions. Results: Twenty-two responses (65%) were received. 91% of respondents reported that formal MCCs are part of regular practice. However, variation exists in the supports in place for ongoing implementation of MCCs, the understanding of the functions of MCCs, and the patients presented for discussion. Results also suggest less formalized processes for MCC in provinces without practice standards. Conclusions: Response differences between Ontario and elsewhere suggest that standards for MCC and supports for their implementation make a positive difference in their operation. However, ongoing operational challenges and issues with attendance exist for all sites and suggest that along with development of practice standards, incentives for participation and further education on benefits and function of MCC may support uptake of MCCs in clinical practice. © 2019","Breast neoplasm; Canada; Cross-sectional study; Inter-professional relations; Multidisciplinary care; Neoplasm/diagnosis; Neoplasm/therapy; Patient care team; Quality improvement; Young women",Conference Paper,Scopus

Twenty-seven routine CT descriptors, including tumour location, size, shape, margin, enhancement heterogeneity, and internal and surrounding structures, and associated findings were assessed and DECT parameters were measured in all patients. Multiple logistic regression analyses were applied to identify independent predictors of SCLC. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was compared between CT features combined with DECT metrics and CT features alone for distinguishing SCLC from NSCLC. Results: Histology revealed NSCLC in 80 and SCLC in 26 patients. In univariate analysis, 12 morphological CT features and two DECT metrics differed significantly between NSCLC and SCLC. When DECT parameters were combined with CT features for multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of SCLC were large tumour size, central location, confluent mediastinal lymphadenopathy, homogeneous enhancement, absence of coarse spiculation, and lower iodine density and iodine ratio (all p<0.05). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was improved from 0.908 to 0.981 after adding DECT metrics compared with CT features alone (p=0.007).

Ectopic expression of IKBKE induces malignant transformation, cell migration, invasion and chemoresistance. Thus, IKBKE is an attractive target for anti-cancer drug development. Methods: By screening of NCI Diversity Set and Clinical Collection I and II compound libraries using cell-based assay, we identified several candidates of IKBKE inhibitors, which directly inhibited IKBKE kinase activity in vitro and in vivo. One of them, malachite green oxalate (MCCK1), was further characterized. The mechanism was examined by western blot, immunoprecipitation (IP) and Immunofluorescence. We also evaluated in a mouse xenograft model. In vitro kinase assay and luciferase reporter assay were also performed in our experiments. Results: MCCK1 inhibits IKBKE kinase as well as its downstream targets such as IκBα p65 and IRF3. MCCK1 is a selective inhibitor for IKBKE, with moderate effect on TBK1, but does not inhibit the activation of IKKα/β STAT3, Erk-1/2, p38 or JNK. The inhibition of IKBKE by MCCK1 resulted in induction of cell growth arrest and apoptosis selectively in human cancer cells that harbor aberrant expression of IKBKE. Furthermore, MCCK1 inhibits tumor growth in nude mice of human cancer cells in which IKBKE is elevated but not of those cancer cells in which it is not. Conclusion: These data indicate that MCCK1 is an IKBKE inhibitor with anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo and could be a potential anti-cancer agent for patients with tumors over expressing IKBKE. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Drug screening; IKBKE; IRF3; IκBα; Malachite green oxalate",Article,Scopus

We sought to understand women's integrative naturopathic oncology (INO) use in addition to usual conventional oncology (UCO) use, their involvement in treatment decision-making (TDM), and their satisfaction with healthcare providers. Methods: A secondary analysis was conducted using baseline data from the Breast Cancer Integrative Oncology Study that recruited 427 women from INO clinics (INO cohort) and comparison women from the Cancer Surveillance System Registry who received UCO care (UCO cohort) in Western Washington State. Self-reported data and Registry data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-tests, and X2 tests to compare Receivers and Decliners in demographic and disease characteristics, use of INO in addition to UCO care, involvement in TDM, and satisfaction with healthcare providers. Results: Significantly more Decliners were in INO cohort than UCO cohort. Decliners in INO cohort were less likely to receive radiotherapy. Women who used INO care, and Decliners, compared with Receivers, tended to be “very involved” in their TDM. No difference was found in participation congruence, correspondence between preferred and actual involvement in medical TDM, between groups. Decliners in INO cohort reported significantly less satisfaction with their conventional oncologist than Receivers in INO cohort. Conclusions: Decliners of conventional adjuvant therapies were very involved in their TDM and those Decliners who seek INO care were less satisfied with their conventional oncologist; these women may need the most attention to assure they receive the care they need. © 2019","Adjuvant therapy; Breast cancer; Conventional oncologist; Decliners; Integrative naturopathic oncologist; Involvement in treatment decision-making; Satisfaction with healthcare providers",Article,Scopus

The etiology of this condition is multifactorial and has not yet been completely elucidated. Risk factors include high body mass index, radical surgical procedures (i.e. mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection), number of lymph nodes removed and number of metastatic lymph nodes, as well as nodal radiation, and chemotherapy. However, these predisposing factors explain only partially the BCRL occurrence, suggesting the possible involvement of individual determinants. Despite the implementation of conservative approaches, BCRL still remains in a proportion of cases an incurable and progressive condition with major physical and psychological implications. To date, diagnostic methods and staging systems lack uniformity, leading to a possible underestimation of the real incidence of this condition, decreasing early detection and thus the possibility of an effective treatment. Several preventive and therapeutic options are available, both conservative and surgical, but are not included in a standardized intervention protocol, tailored on patient's specific characteristics. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-knowledge of BCRL management, novel advantages in the assessment of pre-operative evaluation and risk prediction and discuss strengths and weaknesses of diagnostic and treatment strategies currently accessible in clinical practice. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Axillary lymph nodes dissection; Breast cancer; Breast cancer related lymphedema; Complications; Radiation therapy",Review,Scopus

We sought to determine the utility of lymph node count as a quality metric. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the California Cancer Registry database (2004-2011) merged with Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development inpatient database. Patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent neoadjuvant therapy and resection were included. Hospital quality score was defined as the proportion of patients at a particular hospital that had adequate examination with at least nine lymph nodes. High-quality score hospitals were those that retrieved nine or more nodes among ≥25% of operations. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards (standard and shared frailty) model was used to determine differences in overall survival adjusting for age, hospital volume, race, sex, insurance, comorbidity, T-stage, response to neoadjuvant therapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, and teaching hospital status as covariates. Results: A total of 2704 patients were treated at 228 hospitals (low-scoring hospital = 85 and high-scoring hospital = 143). Patient- and disease-specific characteristics were similar between the groups. Socioeconomic status and hospital characteristics were strongly associated with score status. High-scoring hospitals had higher sphincter preservation (P = 0.004), lower complications (P = 0.021), and a trend toward lower mortality (P = 0.079). Care at high-scoring hospitals independently predicted overall survival (hazard ratio: 0.74; 95% confidence interval: 0.61-0.90; P = 0.003). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that hospital quality score based on lymph node count can be used to identify underperforming hospitals. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Cancer survival; Lymph nodes; Outcomes research; Quality improvement; Rectal cancer",Review,Scopus

We therefore examined expenditures for major cancer surgery to understand physician-specific variation in episode payments. Methods: We used Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results–Medicare data to identify patients aged 66–99 y who underwent a prostatectomy, nephrectomy, lung, or colorectal resection for cancer from 2008 to 2012. We calculated 90-d episode payments, attributed each episode to a physician, and evaluated physician-level payment variation. Next, we determined which component (index admission, readmission, physician services, postacute care, hospice) drove differences in payments. Finally, we evaluated payments by geographic region, number of comorbidities, and cancer stage. Results: We identified 39,109 patients who underwent surgery by 1 of 7182 providers. There was wide variation in payments for each procedure (prostatectomy: $7046–$40,687; nephrectomy: $8855–$82,489; lung resection: $11,167–$223,467; colorectal resection: $9711–$199,480). The largest component difference in episode payments varied by condition: physician payments for prostatectomy (29%), postacute care for nephrectomy (38%) and colorectal resections (38%), and index hospital admission for lung resections (43%) but were fairly stable across region, comorbidity number, and cancer stage. Conclusions: For patients undergoing major cancer surgery, 90-d episode payments vary widely across surgeons. The components driving such variation differ by condition but remain stable across region, number of comorbidities, and cancer stage. These data suggest that programs to reduce specific component payments may have advantages over those targeting individual physicians for decreasing health care expenditures. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Cancer surgery; Cost; Merit-based Incentive Program; Payment",Article,Scopus

Materials and methods: All invasive breast cancers and non-invasive breast cancers (ductal carcinoma in situ; DCIS) that received external whole-breast radiation between 2011 and 2016 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Box plots were used to evaluate variation over time and logistic regression was carried out to address other factors influencing the variation. Funnel plots were constructed, with unadjusted and adjusted data for patient and tumour factors significantly affecting the use of a boost. Results: For breast cancer patients (n = 45,207), the proportion receiving a boost and its range decreased over the years from 37.3–92.7% in 2011 to 28.3–65.4% in 2016. This trend was not observed in DCIS patients (n = 6,844). Young age, large tumours, high grade and the absence of tumour-free resection margins were associated with boost use for both breast cancer and DCIS. For breast cancer, triple-negative tumour subtype and metastatic lymph node involvement were also associated with boost use. Institutional factors did not influence the use of a boost and institutional variation remained substantial after case-mix adjustments. Conclusion: Following adjustment of a nationwide implemented guideline, variation in radiation therapy boost use decreased in patients with breast cancer but not in patients with DCIS. Several tumour and patient characteristics were associated with boost use. Substantial institutional variation could not be explained by differences in patient, tumour or predefined institutional characteristics. © 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists","Boost; breast cancer; breast-conserving therapy; radiation therapy; whole-breast irradiation",Article,Scopus

However, there is limited evidence on how health professionals (HPs) promote PA during cancer treatment. This study aimed to investigate how and when PA is promoted throughout the chemotherapy pathway among colorectal cancer survivors. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted with adults with CRC receiving chemotherapy at a large cancer centre. Cross-sectional observation of clinical consultations was conducted at four points during the chemotherapy pathway: prior, midpoint, final cycle, and 8 weeks following chemotherapy. Following completion of treatment, audio-recorded, semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients and HPs and transcribed verbatim. Codes and themes were identified and triangulated from all the data using framework analysis. Observational themes are reported and complimented by interview data. Results: Throughout the chemotherapy pathway (pre, midpoint, end), many opportunities were missed by HPs to promote PA as a beneficial means to maintain functioning and ameliorate cancer treatment side effects. When discussed, PA levels were used only to determine fitness for future oncological treatment. No PA promotion was observed despite patients reporting low PA levels or treatment side effects. Post-treatment, PA promotion was more routinely delivered by HPs, as evidenced by problem-solving and onward referrals to relevant HPs. Conclusion: PA promotion was largely absent during treatment despite it being a key component of patient self-management following treatment. This suggests considerable missed opportunities for HPs to provide cancer survivors with PA evidence-based interventions. Further research is necessary to identify how best to ensure PA is promoted throughout the cancer journey. Implication for cancer survivors: These findings suggest many may not be receiving support to be physically active during treatment. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Colorectal neoplasms; Physical activity; Qualitative; Self-management",Article,Scopus

We found α-Solanine decreased cell viability in human PCa cells rather than normal prostate epithelial cells in vitro. Functional experiments showed that cell viability and colonies formation were declined & apoptosis rate and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) marker γ-H2AX expressions were elevated by α-Solanine in PCa cells treated with X-ray irradiation, compared with X-ray irradiation treatment only. GAS5 was down-regulated & miR-18a was up-regulated in PCa cells, which was reversed in the presence of α-Solanine. Effects of ectopic GAS5 on inhibiting cell viability and survival & promoting apoptosis and DNA damage were reversed by miR-18a overexpression in PCa cells. Moreover, GAS5 regulated miR-18a expression by target binding during α-Solanine treatment. Collectively, α-Solanine suppresses cell proliferation and promotes radiosensitivity through up-regulating GAS5/miR-18a pathway in PCa.

Inability of normal epithelial cells to attach to the ECM induces apoptosis (anoikis). Cancer cells are often anoikis resistant, a prerequisite for their metastatic spread. Previously we demonstrated that the placenta manipulates its surrounding ECM in a way that prevents breast cancer cells (BCCL) attachment and induces their motility and aggregation. This fits with the fact that although breast cancer during pregnancy is often advanced, metastasis to the placenta is rarely observed. Placental intervillous space provides suitable conditions for cancer cell arrival. Yet, the outcome of the short communication between the placental ECM to the BCCL and its effect on BCCL malignant potential are unknown, and are the focus of our study. In the current study we analyzed the effect of placental ECM on BCCL survival pathways and drug resistance. Microarray analysis suggested activation of the NF-κB and stress response pathways. Indeed, the placenta-conditioned ECM induced autophagy in ERα + BCCL, inactivated the NF-κB inhibitor (IκB) and increased integrin α5 in the BCCL. The autophagy mediated MCF-7 and T47D migration and the placental ECM-BCCL interactions reduced the BCCL sensitivity to Taxol. We also demonstrated by using siRNA that integrin α5 was responsible for the MCF-7 autophagy and suggest this molecule as a suitable target for therapy. © 2018 UICC","breast cancer; ECM; metastasis; placenta; survival pathways",Article,Scopus

The downregulation of Stat3/hnRNP-A1/PKM2 by let-7a-5p is verified using a breast cancer. These results suggest that let-7a-5p, Stat3, and hnRNP-A1 form a feedback loop, thereby regulating PKM2 expression to modulate glucose metabolism of breast cancer cells. These findings elucidate a new pathway mediating aerobic glycolysis in breast cancers and provide an attractive potential target for breast cancer therapeutic intervention. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","hnRNP-A1; let-7a-5p; pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2; Stat3",Article,Scopus

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the risks of perinatal complications in female cancer survivors diagnosed before the age of 40 years. Methods: All published articles on pregnancy, perinatal or congenital risks in female cancer survivors were screened for eligibility. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. Results: Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis indicates that offspring of cancer survivors are at increased risk of prematurity (relative risk [RR]: 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37–1.77) and low birth weight (RR 1.47; 95% CI 1.24–1.73) but not of being small for gestational age (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.81–1.22). Cancer survivors have higher rates of elective (RR: 1.38; 95% CI 1.13–1.70) and emergency caesarean section (RR: 1.22; 95% CI 1.15–1.30) as well as assisted vaginal delivery (RR: 1.10; 95% CI 1.02–1.18) and are at increased risk of postpartum haemorrhage (RR: 1.18; 95% CI 1.02–1.36). The risk of congenital abnormalities also appears increased (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.02–1.20), but this is likely to be an artefact of analysis. Although meta-analysis of the effects of radiotherapy was not possible for all outcomes, there was an increased risk of prematurity (RR 2.27; 95% CI 1.34–3.82) and consistent findings of low birth weight (RR 1.38–2.31). Risk of being small for gestational age was increased only after high uterine radiotherapy dosage. Conclusion: The increased perinatal risks warrant a proactive approach from healthcare providers in both counselling and management of perinatal care for cancer survivors. © 2019","Cancer survivors; Congenital abnormalities; Low birth weight; Perinatal risk; Postpartum haemorrhage; Premature delivery",Article,Scopus

Presently, most of the evidence is from insurance-based studies in the USA. Between 2007 and 2010, 879 HNSCC patients were identified through the population-based cancer registry of the Friuli Venezia Giulia region, including 266 oral, 187 oropharyngeal, 136 hypopharyngeal, and 290 laryngeal cancers. Health-care costs from diagnosis to treatment initiation and in the following 2 years were retrieved through a record linkage with the regional health data warehouse. This database collected comprehensive health information on all resident citizens. Generalized linear models with a gamma distribution and log-link function were applied to model costs. The average health-care cost from diagnosis up to 2 years after treatment initiation was €20,184 (95% confidence interval: €19,634 − 20,733). Heterogeneity emerged according to cancer site, elective treatment, and retreatment for cancer persistence/recurrence (no: €13,896; yes: €24,599; p < 0.001). An advanced stage was associated with increased costs stage (I: €12,969; II: €18,276; III: €26,229; IV: €25,574; p < 0.001) as the result of treatment complexity and elevated frequency of patients retreatment due to recurrence. These findings further support strategies to diagnose patients at an earlier cancer stage and the accurate definition of diagnostic and treatment pathways, to start treating patients when radical unimodal approach is still feasible. Besides the advantage in prognosis due to timely curative treatments, this would reduce the economic burden of cancer treatment. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Diagnostic cost; Economic burden; Head and neck cancer; Population-based study; Treatment cost",Article,Scopus

Its anti-cancer potential and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been well elucidated. Purpose: This study aims to investigate the anti-cancer effects of F3 on human breast cancer cell lines and its underlying mechanisms. Methods: MTT assay was first performed to detect the effect of F3 on cell viability in human breast cancer cell lines and human mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells. Cell apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS level were detected by flow cytometry. Comet and immunofluorescence assays were utilized to assess DNA damage and expression of γ-H2AX. Autophagy were observed by AO staining and fluorescence microscopy. The expression of relative proteins was detected by western blotting. The xenograft model in nude mice was used to elucidate the effect of F3 on tumor growth and DNA damage in vivo. Results: F3 could significantly inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells in concentration-dependent manner by inducing apoptosis and has no obvious inhibitory effect of the growth on MCF-10A cells. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that F3-induced apoptosis was mediated by DNA damage as presented by DNA strand breaks and γ-H2AX activation that might be attacked by ROS accumulation. This triggered several key molecular events involving activation of MAPKs pathway. Further study showed that F3 induced autophagy with the autophagosome formation and increased LC3-II levels. Finally, in vivo study, F3 exhibited a potential antitumor effect and induced DNA damage in MDA-MB-231 xenografts. Conclusion: The antitumorigenic activity of F3 was found in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that F3 may be a potential natural active fraction for the treatment of human breast cancer. © 2018","Breast cancer; Cell death; DNA damage; F3",Article,Scopus

Forty-five completely staged and treatment-naïf dogs with histologically-confirmed nMZL were enrolled. After staging, dogs received chemo-immunotherapy or chemotherapy. PB infiltration was significantly associated with TTP (p = 0.001): dogs with PB infiltration <30% had a median TTP of 186 days, whereas dogs with PB infiltration ≥30% had a median TTP of 43 days. Additionally, vaccinated dogs had a significantly (p = 0.012) longer TTP (399 days) compared with dogs receiving chemotherapy only (211 days). BM infiltration was significantly associated with LSS (p < 0.001): dogs with BM infiltration <1% had a median LSS of 1403 days, those with BM infiltration 1–20% of 337 days, and those with BM infiltration ≥20% of 188 days. Normal LDH levels and the administration of chemo-immunotherapy also significantly improved LSS (560 vs 211 days, and 399 vs 211 days, respectively; p < 0.001).

Purpose: To identify physical activity programs for children diagnosed with cancer and summarize program characteristics. Methods: Five data sources were searched to identify physical activity programs offered to children diagnosed with cancer. Following confirmation of eligibility, correspondents were sent a series of open-ended questions via email. Data were extracted from responses and summarized descriptively and narratively. Results: Of the 140 unique correspondents contacted, 46 programs, in 10 countries, met eligibility criteria. Responses to open-ended follow-up questions were obtained from 36 programs and were subsequently included in the content analysis. Internationally, the majority of programs are being offered to children in Europe, with mixed cancer types, at different stages of the cancer trajectory. There is relatively equal distribution with regard to the setting in which programs are offered (i.e., community, hospital, combination). All correspondents reported that their program is professionally supervised, and most require that children obtain medical clearance prior to participating. There is considerable variability in terms of other key program (e.g., funding) and physical activity characteristics (e.g., frequency). Conclusions: Findings from this environmental scan highlight where and in what capacity physical activity programs are being offered, providing guidance for those seeking to develop/implement physical activity programs themselves. Moreover, results highlight the current state of practice, underscoring the necessity of international networks, multi-site collaborations, and public relations to ensure all children diagnosed with cancer have access to physical activity programs. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Community programs; Exercise; Knowledge translation; Oncology; Pediatric",Review,Scopus

Materials and methods: Basic medical information was derived from the double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (IMpower133, NCT02763579). A Markov model was developed to simulate the process of small-cell lung cancer, including three health states: progression-free survival (PFS), progressive disease (PD), and death. Utilities and costs were obtained from published resources. Sensitivity analyses were applied to explore the impact of essential variables. Results: Treatment with atezolizumab plus chemotherapy was estimated to increase costs by $52,881compared with chemotherapy alone, with a gain of 0.10 quality adjusted life years (QALYs), leading to an incremental cost-effective ratio of $528,810 per QALY.

So, it might have a role in the incidence and etiology of hormone-related cancers such as ovarian cancer as the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. This study aimed to evaluate the estrogenic effect and underlying mechanism of Cd in ovarian cancer cell line proliferation. OVCAR3 and SKOV3 cell lines were treated with different concentrations of CdCl 2 (0- 50 μM). Cell proliferation was analyzed using MTT and BrdU assay. To evaluate the estrogenic effect of Cd, the cells were pre-incubated with estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI 182,780. The expression of ER was determined using western blotting method. Real-time RT-PCR method was used to assess c-fos, c-jun and FOXO3a mRNA level. The results showed that Cd has an estrogenic proliferative effect at nM concentration range and ICI 182,780 significantly reversed the CdCl 2 -induced cell proliferation. Cd also increased the expression of ERs. Cd exposure induced activation of p-ERK1/2 in these cells. Cd also intensified c-jun, c-fos, and FOXO3a mRNA expression. Taken together, the current work suggests that Cd induces ovarian cancer cell proliferation in an ER-dependent mechanism induced ERK1/2 activation pathway.

Yet, existing 3D torso scanners are expensive and either infrastructure-heavy or subject to motion artefacts. In this paper we employ a single consumer-grade RGBD camera with an ICP-based registration approach to jointly align all points from a sequence of depth images non-rigidly. Subtle body deformation due to postural sway and respiration is successfully mitigated leading to a higher geometric accuracy through regularised locally affine transformations. We present results from 6 clinical cases where our method compares well with the gold standard and outperforms a previous approach.

Although more than 80% of women survive the experience, very few studies have been conducted to examine the question of resilience among long-term survivors of breast cancer. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical and sociodemographic factors that correlate with greater resilience in women survivors of breast cancer, in the Costa del Sol Health Area (Spain). Methods: Accordingly, a descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted, with respect to 59 survivors of breast cancer, who each completed a questionnaire for analysis according to the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). Results: The median resilience score was 77 (interquartile range 70–80).

Methods: We identified 448 patients with resected distal cholangiocarcinoma from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. The X-Tile program was used to calculate the cutoff values for the LNR and PLNC that discriminate survival. The overall survival and cancer-specific survival rates were calculated. Relationships between clinicopathological factors and patient survival were assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: The optimal cutoff values for the LNR and PLNC were 0.45 and 3, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that tumor size, the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, T stage, the LNR and PLNC were significantly associated with prognosis (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the LNR, T stage, and tumor size were independent prognostic factors for cancer-specific and overall survival, whereas PLNC was not. In the subgroup of patients with positive lymph nodes, patients with an LNR of greater than 0.45 had significantly worse cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio, 2.418; 95% confidence interval, 1.588 to 3.682; P < 0.001) and overall survival (hazard ratio, 2.149; 95% CI, 1.421 to 3.249; P < 0.001) than those with an LNR of 0.45 or less. Conclusions: The LNR was a better predictor of long-term prognosis than PLNC in patients with distal cholangiocarcinoma. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Distal cholangiocarcinoma; Lymph node ratio; Positive lymph node; Prognosis; survival analysis",Article,Scopus

Clinically available targeted breast cancer therapy is largely ineffective in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by tumors that lack expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2). TNBC is associated with a poor prognosis. Previous reports show that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) partial agonist 2-(4-amino-3-methylphenyl)-5-fluorobenzothiazole (5F 203) selectively inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells, including those of the TNBC subtype. We previously demonstrated that 5F 203 induced the expression of putative tumor suppressor gene cytoglobin (CYGB) in breast cancer cells. In the current study, we determined that 5F 203 induces apoptosis and caspase-3 activation in MDA-MB-468 TNBC cells and in T47D ER + PR + Her2 − breast cancer cells. We also show that caspases and CYGB promote 5F 203–mediated apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells. 5F 203 induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and cathepsin B release in MDA-MB-468 and T47D cells. In addition, silencing CYGB attenuated the ability of 5F 203 to induce caspase-3/-7 activation, proapoptotic gene expression, LMP, and cathepsin B release in MDA-MB-468 cells. Moreover, 5F 203 induced CYGB protein expression, proapoptotic protein expression, and caspase-3 cleavage in MDA-MB-468 cells and in MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors grown orthotopically in athymic mice. These data provide a basis for the development of AhR ligands with the potential to restore CYGB expression as a novel strategy to treat TNBC. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","5F 203; aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR); breast cancer; cell death; cytoglobin (CYGB)",Article,Scopus

MicroRNAs have been reported to participate in the progression of various cancers. In previous studies, miR-301a-3p expression was shown to be upregulated in CRC tissues. However, the underlying mechanism of miR-301a-3p in CRC has not yet been elucidated. Herein, the level of miR-301a-3p was found to be significantly upregulated in CRC clinical tissues and cell lines (HT29 and SW620). In addition, overexpression of miR-301a-3p obviously promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and inhibited cell apoptosis in CRC cells. Meanwhile, upregulated miR-301a-3p expression also enhanced the expressions of Bax, caspase-3, caspase-9, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9, while the expression of Bax-2 was decreased. Furthermore, deleted in liver cancer-1 (DLC-1) and runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) were verified to be direct target genes of miR-301a-3p. Furthermore, overexpression of DLC-1 and RUNX3 revealed antitumor effects in CRC cell lines with the inhibition of cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and the induction of cell apoptosis. In addition, the expressions of Bax, caspase-3, caspase-3, MMP-2, and MMP-9 could be decreased after upregulating the expressions of DLC-1 and RUNX3, along with the upregulation of Bax-2. Moreover, overexpression of miR-301a-3p could promote the growth of xenograft tumors and liver metastasis in vivo, along with reducing the expressions of DLC-1 and RUNX3. Overall, miR-301a-3p might act as a tumor inducer in CRC cells through negatively regulating DLC-1 and RUNX3. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","colorectal cancer (CRC); deleted in liver cancer-1 (DLC-1); metastasis; miR-301a-3p; proliferation; runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3)",Article,Scopus

Nonpharmacological treatment may be a way to treat cancer pain without causing negative side effects. Mindfulness is used as an effective nonpharmacological treatment to improve quality of life (QoL) and to address psychological problems including distress, anxiety, stress, and depression. However, the effect of mindfulness on pain severity has not been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, a systematic review was undertaken to describe the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions for pain and its underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms. The search was conducted in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and CINAHL and included only empirical studies published from 2008 to 2017. Search terms included mindfulness, mindfulness-based intervention, meditation, cancer, pain, and cancer-related pain. Six studies met the search criteria. These studies tested several types of intervention including mindfulness-based stress reduction, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, meditation with massage, and mindful awareness practices.

The decellularized tissues maximized the genetic component removal from tissues and minimally injured ECM structures and native compositions by histology and ECM compositions analyses. Importantly, we proved that the 3D ECM retained tissues biological properties. We demonstrated that after 30 days of recellularization with MCF-7 cell (human breast adenocarcinoma cell line), the 3D cancer ECM induced an overexpression of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer proliferation. Meanwhile, normal ECM from the breast inhibited EMT and cell growth with the inducement of apoptosis.

This study investigated how potentially curative rectal cancer treatment influences subsequent function and health-related quality of life using data from a large-scale survey of patient-reported outcomes. Methods and Materials: All individuals 12 to 36 months after receiving a diagnosis of colorectal cancer in England were sent a survey in January 2013. The survey responses were linked with cancer registration, hospital admissions, and radiation therapy data through the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service. Outcome measures were cancer specific (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy and Social Difficulties Inventory items related to fecal incontinence, urinary incontinence, and sexual difficulties) and generic (EuroQol EQ-5D). Results: Surveys were returned by 6713 (64.2%) of 10,452 patients with rectal cancer. Of these, 3998 patients were in remission after a major resection and formed the final analysis sample. Compared with those who had surgery alone, patients who received preoperative radiation therapy had higher odds of reporting poor bowel control (43.6% vs 33.0%; odds ratio [OR] = 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-1.91), severe urinary leakage (7.2% vs 3.5%; OR = 1.69; 95% CI, 1.18-2.43), and severe sexual difficulties (34.4% vs 18.3%; OR = 1.73; 95% CI, 1.43-2.11). Patients who received long-course chemoradiotherapy reported significantly better bowel control than those who had short-course radiation therapy, with no difference for other outcomes. Respondents with a stoma present reported significantly higher levels of severe sexual difficulties and worse health-related quality of life than those who had never had a stoma or had undergone stoma reversal. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of a large-scale assessment of patient-reported outcomes and provided “real-world” data regarding the effect of rectal cancer treatment. The results show that patients who receive preoperative radiation therapy reported poorer outcomes, particularly for bowel and sexual function, and highlighted the negative impact of a stoma.

While much work focuses on the molecular and cellular events that drive breast cancer bone metastasis, it is mostly unclear what role bone extracellular matrix (ECM) properties play in this process. Bone ECM primarily consists of mineralized collagen fibrils, which are composed of non-stoichiometric carbonated apatite (HA) and collagen type I. Reduced bone mineral content is epidemiologically linked with increased risk of bone metastasis. Yet elucidating the potential functional impact of collagen mineralization on breast cancer cells has remained challenging because of a lack of model systems that allow studying tumor cell behavior as a function of physiological, intrafibrillar collagen mineralization. Here, we have developed cell culture substrates composed of mineralized collagen type I fibrils using a polymer-induced liquid-precursor (PILP) process. Intrafibrillar HA decreased breast cancer cell adhesion forces and accordingly reduced collagen fiber alignment relative to cells cultured on control collagen. The resulting mineral-mediated changes in collagen network characteristics and mechanosignaling correlated with increased cell motility, but inhibited directed migration of breast cancer cells. These results suggest that physiological mineralization of collagen fibrils reduces tumor cell adhesion with potential functional consequences on skeletal homing of disseminated tumor cells in early stages of breast cancer metastasis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bone metastasis; Collagen fiber alignment; Hydroxyapatite; Intrafibrillar collagen mineralization; Mechanosignaling",Article,Scopus

The aims of this study were to 1) describe body weight changes over time in patients receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancers and 2) explore the influence of pretreatment weight loss, body mass index (BMI) category, symptom burden, mucositis, and nutritional support on body weight changes over time. Methods: Using a longitudinal design, this study investigated a consecutive cohort of head and neck cancer patients who were treated with radiotherapy between January 2015 to January 2016 in a Taiwan medical center (n = 128). Data regarding symptom burden, mucositis severity, and body weight were collected before radiotherapy (T1), one month after the initial radiotherapy (T2), at the completion of radiotherapy (T3), and one month after the completion of radiotherapy (T4). Results: On average, the participants’ body weight decreased by 3.09 kg (SD = 2.79) from T1 to T2, 1.72 kg (SD = 2.06) from T2 to T3, and continued to decrease by 1.04 kg (SD = 2.87) from T3 to T4.

We aimed to investigate this potential association in an East Asian population. Methods: We conducted a multicenter case-control study in East Asia including eight centers. We restricted our analysis to never tobacco smokers (303 cases and 459 controls) and to never tobacco smokers/never alcohol drinkers (243 cases and 403 controls). Results: Among never tobacco smokers, involuntary smoking was associated with a 1.47-fold increase in risk of HNC (95%CI = 1.02, 2.13) and a 1.8-fold increase in the risk of oral cavity cancer (95%CI = 1.14, 2.92). Among never tobacco smokers who were also never alcohol drinkers, increased risks were detected for more than 3 h per day of involuntary smoking exposure and for 15 or more years of exposure. A dose-response relation was suggested for frequency of exposure (p for trend = 0.014) and for years of exposure (p for trend = 0.010) for oral cavity cancer. We did not detect strong increases in the risk of the other HNC subsites. Conclusions: Our study supports the association between involuntary smoking and the risk of HNC. The association may be stronger for oral cavity cancer than for other HNC subsites. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Head and neck cancer; Involuntary smoking; Never alcohol drinkers; Never tobacco smokers",Article,Scopus

ITO electrode that has good light transmittance and electric conductivity is employed as a substrate for dual analysis of cancer cells. ITO electrode is firstly modified by AS1141 aptamer, which could selectively bind to nucleolin overexpressed on the surface of a model breast cancer cell, MCF-7 cell line. The composite of mucin 1 antibody (anti-MUC1) and DNA-AgNCs then binds to MUC1 on the surface of captured MCF-7 cell, forming a sandwich-like structure. Therefore, our method allows noninvasive fluorescence imaging and amplified electrochemical detection using a single labeling platform, providing a biocompatible and highly specific method for adequate analysis of cancer cells. Experimental results demonstrate that strong red fluorescence of DNA-AgNCs clearly displays the loading of cancer cells on ITO electrode after dual recognition, and amplified electrochemical signals of DNA-AgNCs enable improved sensitivity toward quantitative analysis with a detection limit of 3 cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","DNA-templated silver nanoclusters; Electrochemical detection; Fluorescent imaging; ITO electrode; MCF-7 cell",Article,Scopus

For ensuring comprehensive multidisciplinary pediatric care, there is a need to understand and define what spirituality means for them in relation to their child's illness. The purpose of this study is to understand the meaning of spirituality for parents of cancer patients in Lebanon. Methods: This qualitative study followed the Heideggerian interpretive phenomenological method. Through purposeful sampling, 11 parents (mother or father) of children with cancer receiving treatment at a tertiary care center in Beirut, Lebanon were interviewed. Data were analyzed following the hermeneutical process as described by Diekelmann and Ironside (1998). Results: A constitutive pattern and overarching theme, “spirituality is a two-level relationship. It is a relation with God and with people. It is the act of receiving and giving back” and five major themes emerged from the data. These were “Being there for me; ” “Connectedness with other parents is a blessing and a torment; “ “The power of knowing; ” “Communication with Unknown"" and “Spirituality is not religiosity”. Conclusion: Lebanese parents of children with cancer defined the elements of their own spirituality. Relational aspects dominated and communication was an important factor. Implications for practice: This is the first study in the Middle East to address the meaning of spirituality in this population, and would pave the way for a customized palliative care program and integrative approach to patient care. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Cancer; Caregivers; Children; Hermeneutics; Lebanon; Palliative care; Psychological; Qualitative study; Spirituality",Article,Scopus

The U-shaped fiber optic LSPR has high refractive index sensitivity (RIS). Therefore, U-shaped fiber optic LSPR cytosensing afforded ultrasensitivity for cancer cell detection with the limit of detection (LOD) of 30 cells/mL and good linearity in a wide range of 1×10 2 -1×10 6 cells/mL under the optimal conditions of modified AuNPs size and Con A concentration. The U-shaped fiber optic LSPR cytosensing shows more than 29 times lower limit of detection than the straight ones. More importantly, the prepared U-shaped cytosensing was applied to evaluate the N-glycan expression level on the surface of cancer cells under different concentration external stimuli of inhibitor tunicamycin (TM). Noticeably, U-shaped fiber optic LSPR cytosensing showed an acceptable reproducibility, satisfactory anti-interference and good selectivity, and was also applied in the assessment of N-glycan expression on surface of six kinds of cell lines.

However, studies frequently find that smokers misperceive SLT and snus to be as or more harmful than smoking. This perception is often measured with a single general harm question, and research on underlying risk perceptions is limited. Methods: Using a sample of 256 current smokers, we utilized Latent Profile Analysis to examine response profiles to items that assessed perceived risk of specific health outcomes (lung cancer, heart disease, oral cancer) from snus relative to cigarettes, along with the typical single item measure of overall harm from snus compared to cigarettes. Results: Three smoker response profiles emerged. Almost half (44.9%) of smokers perceived snus to be as or more risky than cigarettes for all three specific health outcomes (group 1), while over one third (38.3%) had an elevated perceived risk for oral cancer only (group 2). About 17% of smokers perceived snus to have lower risks for lung cancer only (group 3). Across each profile, perceived risk was highest for oral cancer. Conclusions: If smokers are to consider snus for harm-reduction, efforts may be needed to better inform smokers about their lower relative risks, including for particular health outcomes of interest. This study also suggests that smokers may vary in their level of need for information to correct their relative risk misperceptions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Harm perceptions; Measurement; Risk perceptions; Smokeless tobacco; Snus",Article,Scopus

We conducted a nested case–control study using Danish demographic and health data registries and summarized existing evidence in a meta-analysis. The case–control study included all Danish men aged 40–85 years with incident histologically verified prostate adenocarcinoma between 2005 and 2015 (cases). For each case, we selected 10 age–matched controls. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for prostate cancer associated with long–term VKA use adjusted for concomitant drug use, medical history and socioeconomic status. Among 38,832 prostate cancer cases, 1,089 (2.8%) had used VKAs for 3 or more years compared to 10,803 (2.8%) controls yielding a crude OR of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.95–1.08). Multivariable adjustment for covariates had limited influence on the association (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.97–1.10). We observed no dose–response relationship (e.g. OR for 5–10 years of use, 1.06 95% CI, 0.97–1.16). We included 8 studies in the meta–analysis reporting effect estimates from 0.51 (95% CI, 0.23–1.13) to 1.10 (95% CI, 0.94–1.40). Using random effect methods, a pooled effect estimate of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.70–1.05) was obtained; however, there was considerable across–study heterogeneity (I 2 : 93.9%). In conclusion, we did not observe a reduced risk of prostate cancer associated with VKA use in this nationwide study and, taken together with previous study findings, a major protective effect of VKAs against prostate cancer seems unlikely. © 2018 UICC","anticoagulant drugs; case–control studies; prostate cancer; risk factors; warfarin",Article,Scopus

In the current study, C. cassia extract (CCE) was used to investigate the antitumorigenesis mechanism in vitro and in vivo. The major constituents of CCE used in this study were coumarin, cinnamic acid, and cinnamic aldehyde. CCE reduced the viability, number, and colony formation of human oral cancer cells, and induced their apoptosis. Caspase-3 activation, Bcl-2 reduction, and phosphatidylserine inversion were involved in CCE-stimulated apoptosis. CCE also enhanced the expression of autophagic markers, including acidic vesicular organelle, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-I, autophagy-related protein 14, rubicon, and p62. The combined treatment of CCE and caspase inhibitor significantly restored mitochondrial membrane potential (Δ ψ m ) and cell viability. However, the combined treatment of CCE and autophagy inhibitor further reduced the cell viability indicating that autophagy might be a survival pathway of CCE-treated SASVO3 cells. In contrast, CCE treatment for 12 days did not adversely affect SASVO3 tumor-bearing nude mice. CCE also elicited dose-dependent effects on the decrease in tumor volume, tumor weight, and Ki-67 expression. These results suggested that CCE showed the potential for the complementary treatment of oral caner. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","apoptosis; autophagy; Cinnamomum cassia; oral cancer",Article,Scopus

Because of the low incidence of spinal metastasis from gastrointestinal cancer and the limited life expectancy of these patients, few studies have been reported in this population. We evaluated the prognostic value of trunk muscle area and density in predicting overall survival. Methods: The data from 78 patients with spinal metastases from gastrointestinal cancer, collected from February 2009 to July 2016, were evaluated. Psoas muscle and paravertebral muscle area and density were measured at the L3 level on CT scans taken at the time nearest to the diagnosis of spinal metastasis. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to evaluate the factors independently associated with overall survival. Results: The mean patient age was 68.3 years (range, 42–88 years). The overall median survival time was 4.8 months: 2.2 months in the extremely rapid growth group (stomach, biliary tract, and pancreas) and 7.6 months in the rapid growth group (esophagus, liver, and colorectum). Multivariate analyses showed that lower paravertebral muscle density (HR 2.23 [95% CI 1.24–3.99], p = 0.007), extremely rapid growth group, presence of abnormal laboratory data, poor performance status, and chemotherapy after spinal metastasis were independent prognostic factors. Conclusions: Median overall survival was poor among patients with spinal metastases from gastrointestinal carcinoma, especially among those with gastric, biliary tract, or pancreatic cancer.

Separate multivariable linear regression models were used to examine associations between sedentary behavior variables with the cognitive domain scores of attention, executive functioning, episodic memory, working memory, and information processing speed. Results: Thirty breast cancer survivors with a mean age of 62.2 (SD = 7.8) years who were 2.6 (SD = 1.1) years since diagnosis completed study assessments.

No other sedentary behavior variables were statistically significantly associated with the cognitive domains examined in this study. Conclusions: Two important sedentary constructs that are amenable to intervention, including time in prolonged sitting bouts and standing time, may be associated with cognitive function in breast cancer survivors.

However, the precise mechanisms by which surgical trauma promotes colon cancer progression remain poorly understood. Methods: To unravel the mechanisms underlying surgery-induced colon cancer progression, a syngenic transplantation tumor model was established with CT26 cells, and the effect of laparotomy on tumor progression was investigated. Especially, the expression of several chemokines was assessed, and their roles in recruiting CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) after surgery were analyzed. Results: Tregs population was significantly increased in the tumor tissue and peripheral blood of tumor-bearing mice after laparotomy. C-C motif chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) expression was significantly upregulated after laparotomy in tumor tissue and the peritoneal cavity of tumor-bearing mice, and it was positively correlated with the recruitment of Tregs. Functionally, CCL18 knockdown significantly reduces tumor growth and angiogenesis compared with control. Through analysis of Tregs, we found an upregulated proportion of Tregs in tumor tissue, peritoneal cavity, and peripheral blood after laparotomy, but this enhancement was blocked after CCL18 knockdown. In patients with colon cancer, a higher Tregs proportion is positively correlated to more advanced clinical TNM stages and shorter survival. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between the serum CCL18 level and the Treg proportion in clinical samples. Conclusion: Surgical trauma contributes to colon cancer progression by increasing CCL18 expression and hence promotes Treg recruitment, which leads to an immunosuppressive environment. © 2018 The Authors.

In a previous study, we demonstrated that HBP1 suppressed cell invasion in oral cancer. To further understand the underlying mechanism, the current study is aimed at investigating how HBP1 exerts its antimetastatic potential in oral cancer. In a cell model, ectopic expression of HBP1 potently suppressed epithelial–mesenchymal transition, cellular migration, and invasion; conversely, HBP1 knockdown promoted these malignant phenotypes. The matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family is highly implicated in tumor metastasis. Therefore, we examined the effect of HBP1 on the activation of the MMP members, MMP-2, -9, and -13 that are highly associated with the aggressiveness of oral cancer. Ectopic expression of HBP1 resulted in a mild reduction in the expression and activity of MMP-2 and -9, yet it had a potent inhibitory effect on MMP-13. In contrast, HBP1 knockdown strongly enhanced the activation of MMP-13. Further, we demonstrated that MMP-13 is a target of HBP1 transcription repression as evidenced by the identification of an HBP1 binding site in the cis proximal region of the MMP-13 promoter.

In this current study, we designed an HPV vaccine including CpG oligodeoxynucleotides 1826 as an adjuvant and HPV16 E7 43-77 peptide as antigen, which contains a CD8 T cell epitope (E7 49-57), and two CD4 T cell epitopes (E7 43-77 and E7 50-62). The prophylactic and therapeutic effect on cervical cancer induced by a single administration of vaccine, were comprehensively evaluated by examining the tumor size and the percentage of tumor-free/bearing mice. The cellular immunity and modulation of immunosuppressive cells induced by the vaccine were evaluated by examining intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) of splenocytes and FCM, respectively. Antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses were investigated using in vivo cytolytic assay. The results showed that the single administration of vaccine elicited significant prophylactic as well as therapeutic effect on cervical cancer. The increased cellular immunity mediated by CD4 + IFN-γ + T cells and CD8 + IFN-γ + T cells, and the decreased numbers of immunosuppressive cells including regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were induced by the vaccine. Antigen-specific CTL response was also induced by vaccination. These findings suggested that significant anti-tumor effect of the vaccine may result from the induction of increased cellular immunity and decreased immunosuppressive cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Adjuvant; Cervical cancer; CpG oligodeoxynucleotides; Human papillomavirus; Peptide; Vaccine",Article,Scopus

Materials and methods: Women with breast cancer were recruited within one week of completion of breast cancer surgery. They were asked to complete several questionnaires to measure the generic and breast cancer specific quality of life, depression and anxiety levels, attachment styles in close relationship, and meaning in life. Assessments were performed at baseline (T0), T1 (the 2nd month), T2 (the 5th month), T3 (the 8th month), and T4 (the 14th month). Results: While the generic functions of quality of life improve after surgery, no significant changes of the breast-specific functions were found during the 14-month follow up period. While physical, role, and social functions improved immediately after surgery, the improvements of emotional and cognitive functions began to occur at the 5th and the 8th months after surgery. Depressive symptoms predicted almost all general and breast-specific QOL functions and symptoms. Avoidant and anxious attachment styles were associated with the negative scores for breast-specific functions and symptoms. Conclusion: Breast-specific functions, in particular body image and sexual function, remain unchanged with the passage of time following surgery. A psychological rehabilitation program aiming to reduce depressive symptoms and enhance secure attachment styles in close relationships needs to be established immediately following surgery and continue through the post-treatment survivorship stages. © 2018","Anxiety; Attachment style in close relationship; Breast cancer; Breast cancer-related symptoms; Depression; Meaning in life; Surgery; Survivors",Article,Scopus

We searched four electronic databases for studies that reported the diagnostic accuracy of HCG, AFP, and/or LDH in sufficient detail for sensitivity and specificity to be calculated by extracting a 2 × 2 table comparing biomarker positivity with testicular cancer recurrence. Screening, data extraction and QUADAS-2 quality assessment were completed by two independent reviewers. From 2406 studies, nine met our inclusion criteria. Eight reported data at the per-patient level. Sample sizes were small (range 5 to 449 patients) and clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. In most studies the specificity for recurrence with AFP and HCG was high (90–100%) but sensitivity was often relatively low, suggesting that many recurrences would not be detected by tumour markers alone. The diagnostic performance of LDH appears poorer. Studies were methodologically weak, with probable selection, incorporation and partial verification bias, and many studies were excluded for not reporting on recurrence-free patients. Limitations including small sample sizes, high heterogeneity, and inconsistent and incomplete reporting mean these results must be interpreted with caution. Despite inclusion of biomarkers in international surveillance guidance, there remains a lack of high quality evidence about their accuracy, optimal thresholds, and the most effective surveillance strategy in relation to contemporary investigative modalities. Higher quality research using data from modern-day follow-up cohorts is necessary to identify opportunities to reduce unnecessary testing. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Alpha-fetoproteins; Beta subunit; Biomarkers; Chorionic gonadotropin; Human; Lactate dehydrogenases; Testicular neoplasms; Tumour",Review,Scopus

One of the mechanisms of the enzyme downregulation is methylation of the promoter of the ALDH1L1 gene. Recent studies underscored ALDH1L1 as a candidate tumor suppressor and potential marker of aggressive cancers. In agreement with the ALDH1L1 loss in cancer, its re-expression leads to inhibition of proliferation and to apoptosis, but also affects migration and invasion of cancer cells through a specific folate-dependent mechanism involved in invasive phenotype. A growing body of literature evaluated the prognostic value of ALDH1L1 expression for cancer disease, the regulatory role of the enzyme in cellular proliferation, and associated metabolic and signaling cellular responses. Overall, there is a strong indication that the ALDH1L1 silencing provides metabolic advantage for tumor progression at a later stage when unlimited proliferation and enhanced motility become critical processes for the tumor expansion.

Therefore, studying the noncoding portion of the transcriptome offers the prospect of identifying novel therapeutic and diagnostic targets. Although evidence of the relevance of noncoding RNAs in cancer is accumulating, we still face many challenges when it comes to accurately profiling their expression levels. Some of these challenges are inherent to the technologies employed, whereas others are associated with characteristics of the noncoding RNAs themselves.

Since SRY-box 2 (SOX2) was demonstrated to be involved in self-renewal and tumorigenicity of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and is aberrantly expressed in HNSCC tumors, the association between MELK and SOX2 was examined. Firstly, MELK inhibition was performed by small interfering RNA or MELK inhibitor OTS167, and it was determined that MELK inhibition by these approaches could decrease the SOX2 expression in HNSCC cells and OTS167 could suppress the SOX2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. The present results indicated that MELK inhibition may target cancer stem cells (CSCs) through downregulation of the SOX2 gene. To further confirm the transcriptional regulation of SOX2, the transcription factors (TFs) were screened for SOX2 using a promoter-binding TF assay followed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and a decrease of the majority of the SOX2 TFs following MELK knockdown was observed. The present results provide evidence that MELK serves a key role in CSCs through the regulation of SOX2 and further indicates that MELK inhibition may also be promising for clinical applications in the treatment of HNSCC. © 2019 Spandidos Publications.

Methods: A sample of mothers with cancer (clinical group; n = 64) and a sample of healthy mothers (control group; n = 80) were administered self-report questionnaires investigating parenting stress (the parenting stress index), depressive symptoms (the Zung depression self-rating scale) and emotion regulation strategies (the emotion regulation questionnaire). Results: Depressive levels represented the most significant predictor of maternal parenting stress in both groups (p <.001). In addition, cognitive reappraisal (p <.05) but not expressive suppression significantly predicted parenting stress exclusively in the group of mothers with cancer. Finally, cognitive reappraisal was negatively and significantly associated with time since cancer diagnosis to survey. Conclusions: This study highlights that depressive levels and cognitive reappraisal may play a significant role in parenting stress.

Luteolin (3,4,5,7-tetrahydroxy flavone) is a flavonoid found in different plants such as vegetables, medicinal herbs, and fruits. It acts as an anticancer agent against various types of human malignancies such as lung, breast, glioblastoma, prostate, colon, and pancreatic cancers. It also blocks cancer development in vitro and in vivo by inhibition of proliferation of tumor cells, protection from carcinogenic stimuli, and activation of cell cycle arrest, and by inducing apoptosis through different signaling pathways. Luteolin can additionally reverse epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through a mechanism that involves cytoskeleton shrinkage, induction of the epithelial biomarker E-cadherin expression, and by down-regulation of the mesenchymal biomarkers N-cadherin, snail, and vimentin. Furthermore, luteolin increases levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activation of lethal endoplasmic reticulum stress response and mitochondrial dysfunction in glioblastoma cells, and by activation of ER stress-associated proteins expressions, including phosphorylation of eIF2α, PERK, CHOP, ATF4, and cleaved-caspase 12.

Early detection of prostate cancer is necessary for deciding whether a patient should receive costly and invasive biopsy with possible serious complications. However, existing cancer diagnosis methods based on data mining only focus on diagnostic accuracy, while neglecting the interpretability of the diagnosis model that is necessary for helping doctors make clinical decisions. To take both accuracy and interpretability into consideration, we propose a stacking-based ensemble learning method that simultaneously constructs the diagnostic model and extracts interpretable diagnostic rules. For this purpose, a multi-objective optimization algorithm is devised to maximize the classification accuracy and minimize the ensemble complexity for model selection. As for model combination, a random forest classifier-based stacking technique is explored for the integration of base learners, i.e., decision trees. Empirical results on real-world data from the General Hospital of PLA demonstrate that the classification performance of the proposed method outperforms that of several state-of-the-art methods in terms of the classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the results reveal that several diagnostic rules extracted from the constructed ensemble learning model are accurate and interpretable. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Ensemble learning; Multi-objective optimization; Prostate cancer detection; Rule extraction; Stacking",Article,Scopus

We have developed a novel immunofluorescence staining protocol to detect a panel of seven proteins on PCa tissue from primary tumor biopsies and metastatic lesion autopsy tissue, as well as cancer cells from liquid biopsies. We used a tyramide-based system to amplify the true signal and optimized the protocol to reduce background signal, thereby boosting the signal-to-noise ratio. Any protein-specific antibody in this protocol can be exchanged for a different validated antibody. This protocol therefore, represents a highly informative and flexible assay that can be used to provide important information about cancer tissue for the purpose of improving detection, diagnosis, and treatment. © 2018 The Authors.

In this study, we explored the antipancreatic cancer activity of CuB via the inhibition of expression of the cancer-related long noncoding RNA, actin filament-associated protein 1-antisense RNA 1 (AFAP1-AS1). CuB arrested pancreatic cancer (PC) cells in the G2/M cell cycle phase by suppressing the expression of AFAP1-AS1. Insights into the mechanisms of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) gained from bioinformatics analysis and luciferase activity assays showed that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and AFAP1-AS1 directly compete for miR-146b-5p binding. CuB-induced high miR-146b-5p expression and inhibited the expression of AFAP1-AS1. In summary, reducing the expression of endogenous AFAP1-AS1 effectively increased the available concentration of miR-146b-5p in PC, whereas miR-146b-5p overexpression prevented the expression of endogenous AFAP1-AS1. In particular, we hypothesized that AFAP1-AS1 might act as a ceRNA, effectively becoming a sponge for miR-146b-5p, thereby activating the expression of the EGFR. Thus, CuB suppresses the proliferation, in vitro and in vivo, of PC cells through the ceRNA effect of AFAP1-AS1 on miR-146b-5p. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","AFAP1-AS1; cucurbitacin B; EGFR; miRNA-146-5p; pancreatic cancer",Article,Scopus

Sanguinarine (SNG), a quaternary benzophenanthridine alkaloid, has been shown to induce cytotoxicity in various human cancers and suppresses various pro-tumorigenic processes such as invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis in different cancers. Lack of understanding the anticancer mechanism(s) of SNG has impeded the development of this molecule as a potential anticancer agent. Earlier, we have reported that SNG induces reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent ceramide (Cer) generation and Akt dephosphorylation, leading to the induction of apoptosis in human leukemic cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that SNG has potent anti-proliferative activity against prostate cancer cells. Our data suggest that SNG induces Cer generation via inhibiting acid ceramidase and glucosylceramide synthase, two important enzymes involved in Cer metabolism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SNG induces ROS-depended extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, and prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) cleavage, leading to the induction of apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells. Overall, our findings provide molecular insight into the role of ROS signaling in the anticancer mechanism(s) of SNG. This may provide the basis for its use as a nontoxic and an effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of prostate cancer. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Apoptosis; Ceramide; Extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2; Hydrogen peroxide; Prostate apoptosis response-4; Sanguinarine",Article,Scopus

Methods: We obtained a list of 13 European experts from both the European Society for Therapeutic Radiation Oncology (ESTRO) and the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC). The strategies in decision making for PCI in stage IV SCLC were collected. Decision trees were created representing these strategies. Analysis of consensus was performed with the objective consensus methodology. Results: The factors associated with the recommendation for the use of PCI included the fitness of the patient, young age and good response to chemotherapy. PCI was recommended by the majority of experts for non-elderly fit patients who had at least a partial response (PR) to chemotherapy (for complete remission (CR) 85% of radiation oncologists and 69% of medical oncologists, for PR: 85% of radiation oncologists and 54% of medical oncologists). For patients with stable disease after chemotherapy, PCI was recommended by 6 out of 13 (46%) radiation oncologists and only 3 out of 13 medical oncologists (23%). For elderly fit patients with CR, a majority recommended PCI (62%) and no consensus was reached for patients with PR.

In EMBRACE II, well-defined EBRT is an integral part of the overall treatment strategy with the primary aim of improving nodal control and reducing morbidity. The EMBRACE II EBRT planning concept is based on improved conformality through relaxed coverage criteria for all target volumes. For boosting of lymph nodes, a simultaneous integrated boost and coverage probability planning is applied. Before entering EMBRACE II, institutes had to go through accreditation. Material and methods: As part of accreditation, a treatment planning dummy-run included educational blocks and submission of an examination case provided by the study coordinators. Seventy-one centers submitted 123 EBRT dose distributions. Replanning was required if hard constraints were violated or planning concepts were not fully accomplished. Dosimetric parameters of original and revised plans were compared. Results: Only 11 plans violated hard constraints. Twenty-seven centers passed after first submission. 27 needed one and 13 centers needed more revisions. The most common reasons for revisions were low conformality, relatively high OAR doses or insufficient lymph node coverage reduction. Individual feedback on planning concepts improved plan quality considerably, resulting in a median body V43Gy reduction of 158 cm 3 from first plan submission to approved plan. Conclusion: A dummy-run as applied in EMBRACE II, consisting of training and examination cases enabled us to test institutes’ treatment planning capabilities, and improve plan quality. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Dummy run; EBRT treatment planning; EMBRACE II; QA",Article,Scopus

Treatment with hypomethylating agents (HMA) was introduced between 2004 and 2006 but its impact on population-based survival remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate epidemiological characteristics and survival before and after introduction of HMA treatment. Methods: We performed a population-based analysis of CMML cases reported to the Cantonal Cancer Registries in Switzerland (SWISS) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program from the United States for 1999–2006 (before HMA) and 2007–2014 (after HMA). Time trends were compared for these two time periods. Results: 423 and 4144 new CMML cases were reported to the SWISS and SEER registries, respectively. We observed an increasing proportion of older patients ≥75 years in the SWISS (50.3%–62.3%) compared to a decreasing one in the SEER population (59.1%–55.1%). Age standardized incidence-rates were similar and remained stable in both countries (0.32–0.38 per 100’000 py). Relative survival (RS) improved significantly in the SEER (3 years 27%–37%; 5 years 19%–23%; p < 0.001 for both) but remained stable in the SWISS population (3 years 48% to 40%; 5 years 34% to 26%; n.s. for both). Conclusions: With the exception of opposing age-trends, epidemiologic characteristics are similar in both countries and comparable to other population-based registries. RS remains poor and different time trends of population-based survival cannot be faithfully explained by HMA but most likely by changes in diagnostic accuracy within prognostically distinct age-groups. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia; HMA; Incidence; Population-based cancer registries; SEER; Survival; Switzerland",Article,Scopus

Limitless self-renewal, governed by TERT expression and telomerase activation, is crucial for cancer progression. Thus, telomerase activation through the interplay of mutations (TERTpMut) and epigenetic alterations in the TERT promoter may provide further insight into UBC behavior. Here, we investigated the combined effect of TERTpMut and the TERT Hypermethylated Oncological Region (THOR) status on telomerase activation and patient outcome in a UBC international cohort (n = 237). We verified that TERTpMut were frequent (76.8%) and present in all stages and grades of UBC. Hypermethylation of THOR was associated with higher TERT expression and higher-risk disease in nonmuscle invasive bladder cancers (NMIBC). TERTpMut alone predicted disease recurrence (HR: 3.18, 95%CI 1.84 to 5.51, p &lt; 0.0001) but not progression in NMIBC. Combined THORhigh/TERTpMut increased the risk of disease recurrence (HR 5.12, p &lt; 0.0001) and progression (HR 3.92, p = 0.025). Increased THOR hypermethylation doubled the risk of stage progression of both TERTpwt and TERTpMut NMIBC. These results highlight that both mechanisms are common and coexist in bladder cancer and while TERTpMut is an early event in bladder carcinogenesis THOR hypermethylation is a dynamic process that contributes to disease progression. While the absence of alterations comprises an extremely indolent phenotype, the combined genetic and epigenetic alterations of TERT bring additional prognostic value in NMIBC and provide a novel insight into telomere biology in cancer. © 2018 The Authors.

The gathered data primarily discussed the patients’ basic information, specifically the age, gender, smoking, alcohol consumption, and nutritional status based on levels of serum biochemical markers and PG-SGA scores. Results: Among the participants, 31.2% of the cancer patients were diagnosed with anemia whereas, according to the scores of PG.SGA, 65.0% of patients experienced malnourishment. The anemia was significantly associated with biochemical markers, expecting a transferrin in univariable analyses. Binary logistic regression analysis between anemic cancer patients and non-anemic cancer patients suggested that high PG-SGA score (odds ratio 1.082; 95% CI 1.027–1.141) implied the risk factor for anemia, and high PG-SGA scores could potentially increase the risk of anemia. The multiple regression analysis showed that hemoglobin concentration (OR 0.575; 95% CI 0.450–0.736) and PG-SGA score (OR 1.231; 95% CI 1.013–1.496) were linked to anemia. However, total protein, albumin, prealbumin, serum iron, transferrin, and transferrin saturation lacked a strong relationship with anemia. Conclusion: Anemia prevailed in cancer patients, as nutritionally assessed by PG-SGA, while hemoglobin established a linkage with anemia as they could provide extra predictive information about anemia in patients diagnosed with cancer. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Anemia; Malnutrition; Nutritional assessment; Patient-generated subjective global assessment",Article,Scopus

EGFR overexpression is in 50–75% TNBC and EGFR-mediated signaling has potential as an attractive therapeutic target in some specific subtypes of breast cancer due to its significant association with tumor metastasis and poor prognosis. Therefore, identification of promising therapeutic strategies targeting EGFR with higher specificity toward cancer metastasis is urgently needed. 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PPD), one of the major active metabolites from Panax ginseng, has been widely reported to possess pleiotropic anticancer activities in various cancers. In this study, we investigated the effect of PPD against cancer metastasis and the related molecular mechanisms in TNBC in vitro and in vivo. PPD (>30 μM) suppressed cell proliferation by arresting cell cycle in G0/1 phase and triggering cells apoptosis as shown by cell viability assay, flow cytometry analysis and colony formation assay, whereas lower dose of PPD (<20 μM) decreased metastatic potential of MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells through direct inhibition of cell adhesion, motility and invasiveness. In TNBC xenograft and syngeneic models, PPD treatment markedly decreased tumor growth and lung metastasis. PPD reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), decreased the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) while increased the expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) as shown by Western blot and gelatin zymography. Cell signaling pathways that control the expression or activation of these processes were investigated by Western blot and ELISA assay. PPD treatment reduced the phosphorylation of EGFR and down-regulated the activation ERK1/2, p38 and JNK signaling, which was further validated by using the agonists or inhibitors of EGFR and MAP kinases family. Collectively, these findings suggest that PPD holds therapeutic potential against the tumor metastasis of TNBC via targeting EGFR-mediated MAPK pathway. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","20(S)-protopanaxadiol; Breast cancer; EGFR/MAPK pathways; EMT; Metastasis",Article,Scopus

The biological functions of miR-135 were studied using MTT, colony formation, wound healing, transwell assays as well as tumorigenicity analysis. Gain- and loss- of function of miR-135 studies revealed that ectopic expression of miR-135 in MDA‑MB‑468 and MCF‑7 cells significantly inhibited cell growth, migration, invasion and EMT, at least in part through inhibiting the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

EGFR can form a homodimer or a heterodimer with ErbB3. In this study, we investigated whether homodimers or heterodimers, and which ligand, play a major role in cancer development, with the goal of ultimately identifying therapeutic targets. We demonstrated that the ErbB3 ligand heregulin1 is the strongest mitogenic factor for non–small cell lung cancer cells and is more potent in activating EGFRmut-ErbB3 heterodimers than EGFRwt-ErbB3 heterodimers. We discovered that four of the seven EGFR ligands inhibited heregulin1-induced EGFRwt-ErbB3 activation and cell proliferation by promoting dephosphorylation of heregulin1-induced ErbB3 phosphorylation, whereas the other three did not exhibit such inhibition. Importantly, those four EGFR ligands did not inhibit heregulin1-induced EGFRmut-ErbB3 activation and proliferation of cells with EGFR mutants. We demonstrated that ErbB3 was overexpressed in the lung cancer cells but not in the adjacent normal alveoli or stromal tissue. EGFR and heregulin1 were also highly expressed in lung cancer cells.

Deregulation of FOX proteins is commonly associated with cancer initiation, progression, and chemotherapeutic drug resistance in many human tumors. FOX proteins deregulate through genetic events and the perturbation of posttranslational modification. The purpose of the present review is to describe the deregulation of FOX proteins by oncoviruses. Oncoviruses utilize various mechanisms to deregulate FOX proteins, including alterations in posttranslational modifications, cellular localization independently of posttranslational modifications, virus-encoded miRNAs, activation or suppression of a series of cell signaling pathways. This deregulation can affect proliferation, metastasis, chemotherapy resistance, and immunosuppression in virus-induced cancers and help to chronic viral infection, development of gluconeogenic responses, and inflammation. Since the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is the upstream FOXO, suppressing it can cause FOXO function to return, and this can be one of the reasons for patients to recover from the infection of the viruses used to treat these inhibitors. Hence, FOX proteins could serve as prognosis markers and target therapy specifically in cancers caused by oncoviruses. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cancer; forkhead box proteins; viruses",Review,Scopus

In this study, Hotair was found to be upregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells and clinical specimens. Further investigation showed that knockdown of Hotair dramatically suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation, suggesting that Hotair may stimulate tumorigenesis of CRC.

Materials and methods: HPV DNA and p16 INK4a expression were evaluated in tumor tissue from a U.S. population-based sample of 122 invasive oral cavity cancer cases. Results: HPV DNA was detected in 38 of 122 (31%) oral cavity tumors. Seven genotypes were detected including HPV 16, which was found in 22% of tumors. p16 INK4a was expressed in 30% of tumors and was poorly correlated with HPV DNA detection (Kappa &lt;0.1). Joint positivity for HPV 16 and/or 18 and p16 INK4a was observed in only 7% of cases. When comparing cases diagnosed in 1993–1999 and in 2000–2004, positivity for HPV DNA 16/18 increased from 19% to 39% (p = 0.02) and joint HPV 16/18 – p16 INK4a positivity increased from 0% to 12% (p = 0.01).

The RAD51 paralogs work as multimeric complexes and act downstream of BRCA1 to facilitate HR. Numerous epidemiological studies have linked RAD51 paralog mutations with hereditary cancer predisposition. Despite their substantial links to cancer, RAD51 paralog HR function has remained elusive. Here we identify isoform 1 as the functional isoform of RAD51D, whereas isoform 4 which has a large N-terminal deletion (including the Walker A motif), and isoform 6 which includes an alternate exon in the N-terminus, are non-functional. To determine the importance of this N-terminal region, we investigated the impact of cancer-associated mutations and SNPs in this variable RAD51D N-terminal region using yeast-2-hybrid and yeast-3-hybrid assays to screen for altered protein-protein interactions. We identified two cancer-associated mutations close to or within the Walker A motif (G96C and G107 V, respectively) that independently disrupt RAD51D interaction with XRCC2. We validated our yeast interaction data in human U2OS cells by co-immunoprecipitation and determined the impact of these mutations on HR-proficiency using a sister chromatid recombination reporter assay in a RAD51D knock-out cell line. Our investigation reveals that the interaction of RAD51D with XRCC2 is required for DSB repair. By characterizing the impact of cancer-associated mutations on RAD51D interactions, we aim to develop predictive models for therapeutic sensitivity and resistance in patients who harbor similar mutations in RAD51D. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Double-strand break repair; Homologous recombination; RAD51 paralogs; RAD51D; Walker A motif; XRCC2",Article,Scopus

A U11 peptide conjugated, pH-sensitive DOX prodrug (U11-DOX) was synthesized and used as materials to produce NPs. A curcumin (CUR) and U11-DOX co-encapsulated NPs system (U11-DOX/CUR NPs) was constructed to treat lung cancer.

However, the function of miR-543 involved in cervical cancer (CC) progress remains largely unknown. Thus, this study aimed to explore the potential role of miR-543 and the underlying mechanisms in human CC. In this study, we found that miR-543 was significantly downregulated in 69 CC tissue samples and cell lines when compared to adjacent normal tissues and cell line. Decreased miR-543 was closely correlated with poor clinicopathological parameters including larger tumor size, late FIGO stage and lymph node metastasis. Overexpression of miR-543 in CC cell lines remarkably inhibited cell proliferation, invasion and migration, caused cell cycle arrest, promoted apoptosis in vitro, and suppressed tumor growth in vivo, whereas miR-543 inhibitor showed the opposite effect. Dual-luciferase assay validated that 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) was a direct binding site of miR-543. Rescue experiments showed that restoration of TRPM7 expression partially reversed the miR-543-mediated inhibition of proliferation and invasion in CC cells. Further studies confirmed that P13K/AKT and p38/MAPK signaling was involved in miR-543/TRPM7 axis mediated CC progression. Thus, these findings demonstrated the tumor suppressor role of miR-543 on CC progression, which might serve as a potential biomarker for CC diagnosis and therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cervical cancer; Metastasis; miR-543; Proliferation; TRPM7",Article,Scopus

Herein, we designed a mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN)-based nucleus-targeted system, which could directly target the CSCs and further enter the nucleus by the surface modification of anti-CD133 and thermal-triggered exposure of TAT peptides under an alternating magnetic field (AMF). The nucleus-targeted drug release ultimately leads to an exhaustive apoptosis of the CSCs through combined thermotherapy and hypoxia-activated chemotherapy. In vivo, the nucleus-targeted nano delivery system efficiently inhibits the tumor growth without notable side effects during the course of treatment. Molecular mechanism study illustrates that the system effectively eliminates the CSCs by blocking the hypoxia signaling pathway.

Results: Of the 83 patients analyzed, 18 (21.7%) were positive for ANA. The incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) did not differ significantly between patients with ANA (6/18, 33.3%) and those negative for ANA (21/65, 32.3%), although it tended to increase as the ANA titer increased.

Cell viability assay showed that GA-DM was relatively more toxic to LNCaP cells than to PC-3 cells (IC 50 s ranged 45-55 µM for PC-3, and 20-25 µM for LNCaP), which may have occurred due to differential expression of p53. Hoechst DNA staining confirmed detectable nuclear fragmentation in both cell lines irrespective of the p53 status. GA-DM treatment decreased Bcl-2 proteins while it upregulated apoptotic Bax and autophagic Beclin-1, Atg5, and LC-3 molecules, and caused an induction of both early and late events of apoptotic cell death. Biochemical analyses of GA-DM-treated prostate cancer cells demonstrated that caspase-3 cleavage was notable in GA-DM-treated PC-3 cells.

Starvation is a typical feature of the bladder cancer microenvironment and can induce autophagy. Autophagy has an important relationship with the invasion and migration of tumors. However, the role of autophagy in the invasion and migration of bladder cancer cells remains unclear. Hence, the aim of the current study was to clarify this role and underlying mechanism. In this study, we found that starvation enhanced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-mediated invasion and migration of T24 and 5637 cells while inducing autophagy. The inhibition of autophagy with chloroquine (CQ) or 3-methyladenine (3MA) decreased EMT-mediated invasion and migration. In addition, the expression of transforming growth factor 1 (TGF-β1) and phosphorylated Smad3 (p-Smad3) increased after starvation. The inhibition of autophagy with CQ or 3MA also decreased the expression of TGF-β1 and p-Smad3. The inhibitor of TGF-β receptor sb431542 also inhibited the invasion, migration, and EMT of T24 and 5637 cells during starvation. Furthermore, recombinant TGF-β1 induced autophagy and inhibition of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway with sb431542 suppressed autophagy. In summary, our results suggested that autophagy promotes the invasion and migration of bladder cancer cells by inducing EMT through the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway. Moreover, autophagy and TGF-β1 can form a positive feedback loop to synergistically promote invasion and migration. Thus, our findings may provide a theoretical basis for the prevention of invasion and migration in bladder cancer. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","autophagy; bladder cancer; epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); invasion; migration; transforming growth factor 1 (TGF-β)/Smad",Article,Scopus

(Apocynaceae), has not been explored for its biological effects. To date, cardenolides have received considerable attention in pharmacology studies due to their direct effects of apoptosis-induction or growth-inhibitory against tumor in vitro and in vivo. Whether and how NG exerts anticancer effects against colorectal cancer remains to be elucidated. Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the anticancer effect of NG in human colorectal cancer cells. Methods: To test anticancer effect, we compared potency of NG in two colorectal cancer cell lines, HT29 and SW620 by WST-1 and colony proliferation assays. And we investigated mechanism of anticancer activities by analyzing players in apoptotic and ERK/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathways in HT29 and SW620 cells treated with NG. Results: In this study, we showed that NG markedly suppressed the cell viability and colony formation of colorectal cancer cells HT29 and SW620, with no significant toxic effect on non-cancer cells NCM460. Annexin V-FITC/PI and CFSE labeling results revealed that NG suppressed cell proliferation in low concentration, along with reducing expression of PCNA, while NG induced apoptosis in high concentration,. Meanwhile, NG significantly arrested cell migration by reversal of EMT and cell cycle on G2/M. Then, we found that the ERK and GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway were noticeably blocked in CRC cells after treatment with NG. According to western blot, NG upregulated the expression of p-GSK3β/GSK3β and decreased especially the expression of β-catenin in nuclear. In addition, Wnt signaling and its target genes were suppressed in response to NG. Then, the Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β can be reduced / raised by GÖ 6983 / LiCl, respectively. Thus, we further confirmed that the GSK3β/β-catenin axis is involved in NG-prevented cell proliferation. Conclusion: NG inhibited the growth of colorectal cancer cells by suppressing ERK/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway. And the GSK3β/β-catenin axis is involved in preventing cell proliferation and migration by NG-treatment. These results suggest that NG may be used to treat colorectal cancer, with better outcome by combining with GSK3β inhibitor to block Wnt pathway. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH","Colorectal cancer; GSK3β; Migration; Nerigoside; Proliferation; β-catenin",Article,Scopus

Its validity and utility was demonstrated prospectively across multiple studies. The observational study PONDx characterized the use of Oncotype DX ® Breast in routine practice in France and evaluated its decision impact. Of 882 ER-positive BC patients (67% postmenopausal), most (79%) had N0/Nmic node involvement, grade 2 tumors (68%), tumor size 1–5 cm (88%), and ductal histology (78%). BCs with histopathologically elevated recurrence risk included grade 3: 18%; N1: 21%; Ki67 &gt; 20%: 31%. Recurrence Score results by prognostic category were: &lt;18: 54%, 18–30: 36%; &gt;30: 10%. Compared to recommendations before individual availability of the score, results prompted net absolute reductions in chemotherapy recommendations of 36% (total population), and 29% (grade 3 and/or Ki67 &gt; 20% histologies). Decisions reflected prognostic implications: in the Recurrence Score &lt;18 category, 95% of patients received recommendations of hormonal therapy only, in the &gt;30 category, 97.5% were recommended additional chemotherapy; 95% followed the final recommendations of their physicians. The Recurrence Score provides independent predictive and prognostic information in ER + N0/N1 early BC, including high-risk subgroups. PONDx further characterizes the population where the test is beneficial in real-life use and fits current clinical needs. Oncotype DX ® Breast enables relevant net reductions in chemotherapy use, sparing patients from serious toxicities.

New treatment strategies such as consolidation chemotherapy and different concomitant chemotherapy combinations have been tested in recent years. Identification of the best candidates for each treatment strategy could optimize results. Study design: A retrospective review of data from 127 patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Stages IIB–IVA), treated at a single institution from 2005 to 2014. Risk factors for loco-regional and systemic recurrence, and prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) were analysed using Cox regression. Survival of patients treated with consolidation chemotherapy was compared with survival of patients not treated with consolidation chemotherapy in the role cohort and in a propensity-score-matched cohort. Results: With a median follow-up time of 48.7 months, loco-regional-recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant-metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and OS at 5 years were 76.6%, 54.0% and 63.0%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, tumour size ≥6 cm was associated with shorter LRFS [hazard ratio (HR) 5.18; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45–18.45; p = 0.011], and adenocarcinoma (HR 2.48; 95% CI 1.10–5.57; p = 0.028) and positive lymph nodes (HR 2.21; 95% CI 1.303–4.72; p = 0.041) were associated with shorter DMFS. Tumour size ≥6 cm was associated with shorter OS (HR 2.64; 95% CI 1.09–6.35; p = 0.031). Twenty-two patients were treated with consolidation chemotherapy; on univariate analysis, these patients had longer OS compared with patients who were not treated with consolidation chemotherapy (p = 0.043). In a propensity-score-matched cohort, patients treated with consolidation chemotherapy had longer DMFS and OS compared with patients who were not treated with consolidation chemotherapy, although the difference was not significant. Conclusions: Different risk factors are associated with loco-regional and distant metastases in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer, and could potentially lead to particular therapeutic strategies. Although the number of patients treated with consolidation chemotherapy in the study cohort was small, they seemed to live longer and to have better control of distant relapse then patients who were not treated with consolidation chemotherapy. © 2019","Cervical cancer; Consolidation chemotherapy; Distant recurrence; Local recurrence",Article,Scopus

Material and methods: Here we re-evaluated the impact of tumor size, nodal stage and tumor subtype on disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS) and breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) in a retrospective analysis using data from the adjuvant SUCCESS A trial. Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess whether the effect of tumor size and nodal stage on survival depended on tumor subtype. Results: Increasing tumor size, higher nodal stage and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) were associated with unfavorable prognosis (all p < 0.001). There was no significant interaction between tumor subtype and tumor size (p > 0.5 for all four survival endpoints), but we found significant interactions between tumor subtype and nodal stage (p < 0.05 for all four survival endpoints), with no differences in survival among tumor subtypes for patients with pN0 tumors (all p > 0.05) and pronounced differences in survival among tumor subtypes for patients with positive nodal stage (all p < 0.001). Conclusions: This analysis confirms tumor size, nodal stage and tumor subtype as independent prognostic factors in high-risk early breast cancer. Nodal-positive patients with TNBC had a considerably worse outcome compared to nodal-positive patients with another tumor subtype.

Methods: We predicted lung cancer mortality rates and case numbers to 2100 using a previously validated generalized linear model based on age, birth cohort and population cigarette smoking exposure. We estimated the impact of various tobacco control scenarios: ‘actual tobacco control’ (incorporating the aggregate effect of past and current taxation, plain packaging, mass media campaigns and other initiatives) and scenarios where 10%, 5% and 0% smoking prevalence was achieved by 2025, all of which were compared to a counterfactual scenario with the highest historical smoking consumption level continuing into the future as if no tobacco control initiatives had been implemented. Results: Without tobacco control, there would have been an estimated 392,116 lung cancer deaths over the period 1956–2015; of these 20% (78,925 deaths; 75,839 males, 3086 females) have been averted due to tobacco control. However, if past and current measures continue to have the expected effect, an estimated 1.9 million deaths (1,579,515 males, 320,856 females; 67% of future lung cancer deaths) will be averted in 2016–2100. If smoking prevalence is reduced to 10%, 5% or 0% by 2025, an additional 97,432, 208,714 or 360,557 deaths could be averted from 2016 to 2100, respectively. Conclusion: Tobacco control in Australia has had a dramatic impact on the number of people dying from lung cancer.

While the past few decades have seen significant progress related to the use of these viruses in clinical contexts, the success of oncolytic therapies is dampened by the complex spatial tumour-OV interactions. In this work, we present a novel multiscale moving boundary modelling for the tumour-OV interactions, which is based on coupled systems of partial differential equations both at macro-scale (tissue-scale) and at micro-scale (cell-scale) that are connected through a double feedback link. At the macro-scale, we account for the coupled dynamics of uninfected cancer cells, OV-infected cancer cells, extracellular matrix (ECM) and oncolytic viruses. At the same time, at the micro scale, we focus on essential dynamics of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) system which is one of the important proteolytic systems responsible for the degradation of the ECM, with notable influence in cancer invasion. While sourced by the cancer cells that arrive during their macro-dynamics within the outer proliferating rim of the tumour, the uPA micro-dynamics is crucial in determining the movement of the macro-scale tumour boundary (both in terms of direction and displacement magnitude). In this investigation, we consider three scenarios for the macro-scale tumour-OV interactions. While assuming the usual context of reaction-diffusion-taxis coupled PDEs, the three macro-dynamics scenarios gradually explore the influence of the ECM taxis over the tumour - OV interaction, in the form of haptotaxis of both uninfected and infected cells populations as well as the indirect ECM taxis for the oncolytic virus. Finally, the complex tumour-OV interactions is investigated numerically through the development a new multiscale moving boundary computational framework. While further investigation is needed to validate the findings of our modelling, for the parameter regimes that we considered, our numerical simulations indicate that the viral therapy leads to control and decrease of the overall cancer expansion and in certain cases this can result even in the elimination of the tumour. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Cancer modelling; Multiscale modelling; Tumour-oncolytic virus interactions",Article,Scopus

Therefore, targeting angiogenesis is a rational therapeutic approach and dissecting proangiogenic pathways is important, particularly for malignancies driven by oncogenic KRAS, which are widespread and lack effective targeted therapies. Based on published studies showing that oncogenic RAS promotes angiogenesis by upregulating the proangiogenic NF-κB target genes IL-8 and VEGF, that NF-κB activation by KRAS requires the IKKβ kinase, and that targeting IKKβ reduces KRAS-induced lung tumor growth in vivo, but has limited effects on cell growth in vitro, we hypothesized that IKKβ targeting would reduce lung tumor growth by inhibiting KRAS-induced angiogenesis. Materials and methods: To test this hypothesis, we targeted IKKβ in KRAS-mutant lung cancer cell lines either by siRNA-mediated transfection or by treatment with Compound A (CmpdA), a highly specific IKKβ inhibitor, and used in vitro and in vivo assays to evaluate angiogenesis. Results and conclusions: Both pharmacological and siRNA-mediated IKKβ targeting in lung cells reduced expression and secretion of NF-κB-regulated proangiogenic factors IL-8 and VEGF. Moreover, conditioned media from IKKβ-targeted lung cells reduced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration, invasion and tube formation in vitro. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated IKKβ inhibition reduced xenograft tumor growth and vascularity in vivo. Finally, IKKβ inhibition also affects endothelial cell function in a cancer-independent manner, as IKKβ inhibition reduced pathological retinal angiogenesis in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy. Taken together, these results provide a novel mechanistic understanding of how the IKKβ pathway affects human lung tumorigenesis, indicating that IKKβ promotes KRAS-induced angiogenesis both by cancer cell-intrinsic and cancer cell-independent mechanisms, which strongly suggests IKKβ inhibition as a promising antiangiogenic approach to be explored for KRAS-induced lung cancer therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Angiogenesis; IKKβ; IL-8; KRAS; Lung cancer; Therapeutic target; VEGF",Article,Scopus

When neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is indicated in this subtype, before a possible breast-conserving surgery (BCS), it is more reasonable to target tumor shrinkage than complete pathological tumor response. We aimed to identify breast and tumor 18 Fluoro-deoxy-glucose ( 18 F-FDG) PET-CT scan imaging features for the early prediction of BCS after NAC in luminal/HER2 negative subtypes of breast cancer. Material and methods: Seventy-seven consecutive women with luminal/HER2-negative breast cancer for whom BCS was initially not feasible and NAC was prescribed, to decrease tumor size before surgery, were included retrospectively. An 18 F-FDG PET-CT scan exam was performed before and after the first course of NAC. Results: After NAC, 36% (28/77) of women had a mastectomy and 64% (49/77) underwent BCS. Patients with a mastectomy had lower total breast volume (BV total ) (p = 0.002), lower decrease in Δmetabolic tumor volume (ΔMTV) (p = 0.03) and lower SUV max2 (p = 0.05). Using ROC Curve analyses to define the optimal predictive threshold of BV total (496 cm 3 ) and ΔMTV (-17.1%), 3 subgroups of women with different odds of BCS after treatment were identified (p = 0.001): low, medium and high probability groups (respectively 29%, 62% and 82%). Conclusions: For patients with Luminal/HER2 negative breast cancer, the combination of the imaging features of the tumor and the mammary gland, obtained with 18 F-FDG PET-CT at baseline and after the first cycle of NAC, may allow the physician to evaluate the probability of BCS. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Breast cancer; Chemotherapy; PET-CT; Surgery",Article,Scopus

However, questions concerning the long-term effects of protons on paediatric patients need outcome analysis of the reported literature in order to be answered. The current paper has analysed the available clinical trials and comparative studies (protons vs photons) for paediatric cancers of the central nervous system (CNS) analysing the reported outcomes and follow-up times in order to evaluate the safety of proton therapy for this patient group. Based on the literature analysis, proton therapy for treatment of paediatric cancers of the CNS was found to provide survival and tumour control outcomes comparable, and frequently superior, to photon therapy. Furthermore, the use of protons was shown to decrease the incidence of severe acute and late toxicities, including reduced severity of endocrine, neurological, IQ and QoL deficits. Most commonly, the reported median follow-up time was up to 5 years. Only a few studies reported promising, longer follow-up results. Considering that these patients are likely to survive many of the malignancies reported on, the incidence of long term sequellae impacting growth, development and quality of life into adulthood, should be viewed longitudinally for completeness. The evidence surrounding proton therapy in paediatric tumour management supports its effectiveness and potential benefits in reducing the incidence of late-onset toxicities and second malignancies. For stronger evidence, it is highly desired for future studies to improve current reporting by (1) highlighting the paediatric patient cohort's outcome (in mixed patient groups), (2) reporting the follow-up time, (3) clearly indicating the toxicity criteria used in their evaluation, and (4) identifying the risk group. With this suggested clarity of future reporting, meaningful data to support treatment choice may then be available. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Clinical studies; CNS; Paediatric cancers; Proton therapy",Review,Scopus

This kinase regulates diverse processes associated with malignant progression including proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. To delve into the molecular mechanisms regulated by this kinase we performed RNA-seq and network analysis of breast cancer cells overexpressing IKKε. We found that the TNF/NF-κB cascade was clearly enriched, and in accordance, NF-κB pathway inhibition in these cells resulted in a decreased expression of IKKε target genes. Interestingly, we also found an enrichment of a mammary stemness functional pathway. Upregulation of IKKε led to an increase of a stem CD44+/CD24 −/low population accompanied by a high expression of stem markers such as ALDH1A3, NANOG, and KLF4 and with an increased clonogenic ability and mammosphere formation capacity. These results were corroborated with in vivo dilution assays in zebrafish embryos which showed a significant increase in the number of Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs). Finally, we found that Triple-Negative breast tumors, which are enriched in CSCs, display higher levels of IKKε than other breast tumors, supporting the association of this kinase with the stem phenotype.

In this study, GX1 was utilized to fabricate a multifunctional vascular targeting docetaxel (DCT)-loaded nanoparticle with N-deoxycholic acid glycol chitosan (DGC) as the carrier and GX1-PEG-deoxycholic acid (GPD) conjugate as the targeting ligand. The mean size of obtained GX1-DGC-DCT was 150.9 nm with a narrow size distribution and their shape was spherical with smooth surface texture. The in vitro drug release test revealed a sustained release manner and an acid pH could accelerate the release compared with the neutral pH. Furthermore, GX1-DGC-DCT showed stronger cytotoxicity against co-cultured gastric cancer cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (co-HUVEC) than DCT within 100 μM. In addition, GX1 efficiently enhanced the cellular uptake of nanoparticles in co-HUVEC cells as confirmed by confocal fluorescence scanning microscopy. Moreover, in vivo delivery of GX1-DGC-DCT was demonstrated to inhibit tumor growth in SGC791 tumor-bearing mice with tumor inhibition rate (TIR) of 67.05% and no weight loss of mice was observed. The anti-tumor effects were further confirmed by H&E and TUNEL analysis. Therefore, this new drug delivery system represents a potential strategy for gastric cancer therapy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Chitosan; Docetaxel; Targeted drug delivery",Article,Scopus

It was the aim of the present study to determine the wait times from first presentation to diagnosis, in a sample of Hungarian patients with CRC, as well as to assess the stages of CRC at diagnosis. Methods: A retrospective study based on data from 212 patients with CRC in Baranya county was carried out. Data extraction was performed from 26 GP practices and from the database of the University of Pécs Clinical Center. Total Diagnostic Interval (TDI) was determined as the number of days from the first patient-physician consultation with symptoms until the pathologically confirmed date of diagnosis. Total Treatment Interval (TTI) was calculated until the first day of any form of treatment. Statistical analyses, descriptive analysis and analysis of variance, were performed. Results: A minority (36.8%) of the diagnosed CRC cases were early stage cancers (Stages I-II), while the majority (59.9%) of the cases were diagnosed as advanced stage (Stages III-IV) cancers. The median TDI was 41 days, and the median TTI was 67 days. There was a wide range between minimum and maximum waiting times regarding both diagnosis and initiation of therapy (369–371 days). Conclusions: Wait times to diagnosis and treatment of CRC in Hungary are similar to Western countries however the ratio of advanced cancers at diagnosis is higher. The cause of late diagnosis may be due to patient delay, indicating the need for implementation of primary and secondary prevention. © 2019","Colorectal cancer; Colorectal screening; Diagnosis; Treatment; Waiting-time; Waiting-time paradox",Article,Scopus

Nevertheless, microarray data suffers from the curse of dimensionality when selecting feature genes of the disease based on imbalance samples, thus causing low prediction accuracy. Hence, it is of vital significance to build proper models that can avoid the above problems and predict the CRC more accurately. In this paper, we use an ensemble model to classify samples into healthy and CRC groups and improve prediction performance. The proposed model is composed of three functional modules. The first module mainly performs the function of removing redundant genes. The main feature genes are selected using minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) method to reduce the dimensionality of features thereby increasing the prediction results. The second module aims to solve the problem caused by imbalanced data using hybrid sampling algorithm RUSBoost. The third module focuses on the classification algorithm optimization. We use mixed kernel function (MKF) based support vector machine (SVM) model to classify an unknown sample into healthy individuals and CRC patients, and then, the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is applied to find most optimal parameters of the proposed MKF-SVM. The final results show that the proposed model achieves higher G-means than other comparable models. The conclusion comes to show that RUSBoost wrapping WOA + MKF-SVM model can be applied to improve the predictive performance of colorectal cancer based on the imbalanced data. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Colorectal cancer; Feature selection; Mixed kernel function; Support vector machine; Whale optimization algorithm",Article,Scopus

Methods: The study was a single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Eighty-six subjects were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 46) or control (n = 40) groups. The intervention group received Baduanjin exercise 3 days/week at hospital and another 4 days/week at home for 6 months, whereas the control group were requested to maintain their original physical activity. Outcomes included body mass index (BMI), heart rate variability, lung capacity, arm circumference, shoulder range of motion, step test index, anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QOL). Results: After 6 months of intervention, heart rate variability and shoulder range of motion were significantly improved in the Baduanjin group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). There were also significant improvements in depression, QOL, and four QOL dimension scores (physical well-being, social well-being, functional well-being, and breast cancer subscale) (P < 0.05). However, there were no differences in the BMI, lung capacity, arm circumference, step test index, anxiety, and the emotional well-being QOL dimension scores. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that Baduanjin is an effective intervention for improving physical and psychological health outcomes among breast cancer survivors, which is worth recommending and implementing by oncology nurses for breast cancer survivors during their long rehabilitation journeys. © 2019","Baduanjin exercise; Breast cancer; Health benefit; Qigong; Randomized controlled trial; Survivors",Article,Scopus

Study design: Data from two consecutive years of an annual postal survey of patients with primary breast cancer were combined. Data was collected between February and July 2015 (response rate 72%) and 2016 (response rate 73%) from N = 8893 patients (ICD-10 C50) after hospital discharge from 86 breast cancer center hospitals in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The study used a mixed-methods design. Standardized quantitative survey questions were analyzed descriptively and an open-ended question was analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Around 9% of the patients were invited to participate in a multidisciplinary tumor conference (MTC) and 49% of the invited patients reported actual participation in a MTC. Approximately 87% of those patients did not regret their participation in the MTC. The qualitative analysis from the open-ended question indicated that MTC participation was perceived by patients as being both supportive and informative (n = 109 expressions). However, some patients reported difficult experiences and emotional reactions during and after participation (n = 37 expressions). Altogether, the patients’ perception was divided into positive and negative, cognitive and emotional experiences following participation in a MTC.

Young people face unique challenges in this area because of their life stage, their need to reintegrate with peers, and their own approach to their disease and treatment. This paper explores the perspectives of young people as they return to school during and after curative cancer treatment. Method: 12 young people (6 females, 6 males) from the north of England (aged 13–16 years at time of recruitment) took part in photo elicitation interviews conducted at three time points during the year following a diagnosis of lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, osteosarcoma, A-plastic anaemia or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results: Three main themes emerged: ‘approaches to telling’ ‘lives becoming public property’; and ‘owning the story’. Within these themes participants experienced stressors related to altered peer group dynamics, being propelled into the foreground of the school environment, being responsible for the feelings and needs of others, and conflicts between their perception of coping and the reactions of others. Conclusions: Re-entering school following a diagnosis of cancer can result in challenging dynamics for a young person, which they are not always equipped to manage. Participants displayed individual differences in their approaches and preferences, but inevitably all had to cope with their lives becoming public property and managing the narrative of their cancer experience. © 2019","Adolescent; Cancer; Education; Peers; School; Teenage; Telling; Young people",Article,Scopus

This study determined acupuncture’s effect on cancer-related pain and identified variables associated with pain response. Methods: A retrospective chart review included adult patients with cancer referred to palliative medicine and received acupuncture for pain management. Paired t tests compared differences in pain scores from pre- to postacupuncture. Clinically meaningful pain improvement was defined as ≥2-point reduction in pain score. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between patient characteristics and pain improvement. Results: One hundred seventy acupuncture treatments from 68 individual patients were studied. Significant reductions in mean pain scores were observed after the first treatment (−1.9 ± 1.8; P <.001) and across all treatments (−1.7 ± 1.9; P <.001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated clinically meaningful pain improvement with higher baseline pain scores (odds ratio [OR]: 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.44-2.22; P <.001) and stage III/IV disease (OR: 3.23, 95% CI: 1.11-9.40; P <.001). There were significant improvements in anxiety, depression, drowsiness, dyspnea, fatigue, nausea, and well-being after the first treatment and across all treatments (P <.001). Conclusions: Acupuncture improved cancer-related pain and other symptoms. Those with higher baseline pain scores and advanced disease were more likely to achieve significant pain reduction. Improved depression and fatigue were closely related to pain reduction. Further studies are needed to confirm pain response variables, establish durability, and develop a personalized approach to acupuncture. © The Author(s) 2018.","acupuncture; cancer; pain; palliative; supportive care; symptom",Article,Scopus

Here we reported that the GREM1 expression in mesenchymal-like colon cancer cells (SW620 and SW480) was significantly higher than that of epithelial-like colon cancer cells (Caco-2, HTC116, and HT29) and normal colon cell. Simultaneously, we analyzed two series of CRC transcriptomes from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases and found the great majority of primary CRC tissues expressed high level of GREM1 messenger RNA (mRNA) compared with adjacent normal tissues, and that the GREM1 mRNA expression is correlated with low histological grade development and stage 2 to 3 metastatic recurrence in CRC based on a data analysis of 104 different stage CRC tissue from the GEO databases. Functional studies showed that GREM1 silencing by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) significantly inhibited CRC cells proliferation, migration, the formation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced capillary structure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colon cancer cells by repressing phosphorylation levels of BMP downstream signal Smad1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) downstream signal matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2), and metastasis-related factor C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) expression. In addition, shGREM1 combined with VEGF inhibitor BAW2881 displayed more effective antiangiogenesis to inhibit the tube formation of HUVEC.

We therefore compared OS of EBRT + BT versus RP in comparatively young (≤65 yr) and healthy men (Charlson Comorbidity Index = 0) with high-risk localized PCa in the National Cancer Database. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) adjustment was used to balance baseline characteristics. Median follow-up was 92 mo (interquartile range 78–108). Using IPTW-adjusted Cox regression analysis, EBRT + BT was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality compared with RP (hazard ratio = 1.22, 95% confidence interval 1.05–1.43). In young and healthy men presenting with high-risk localized PCa, RP showed statistically significant OS benefit compared with EBRT + BT.

This study is aiming to study the relationship among SMAD3, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) OPA-interacting protein 5 antisense transcript 1 (OIP5-AS1), and miR-143-3p, and their effects on cervical cancer. Methods: In our research, real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot assay were conducted to detect the expression level of messenger RNA and protein in tumor tissues and cells. Transfection of lncRNA OIP5-AS1, miR-143-3p, or SMAD3 was performed to investigate their potential effects on the function of cell as well as the relationship among them in cervical cell lines via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) together with transwell assays or dual-luciferase reporter assay respectively. Results: SMAD3, lncRNA OIP5-AS1 expression is significantly enhanced in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines, but miR-143-3p was inhibited. LncRNA OIP5-AS1 is demonstrated to mediate the physiological process of cervical cancer cells. Moreover, silencing SMAD3 via siRNA suppressed cell number, viability, migration and invasion, whereas overexpression of OIP5-AS1 promoted these abilities. Furthermore, lncRNA OIP5-AS1 exert its function via sponging miR-143-3p to regulate SMAD3 expression.

Positive encounters regarding work from healthcare professionals have been shown to promote return to work among sickness absentees in general. However, the knowledge about encounters possible associations with sickness absence (SA) in women with BC is scarce. Aim: To explore if women had experienced encounters regarding work from healthcare professionals during the first year after BC surgery and if this was associated with SA during the second year after surgery, controlled for treatment and sociodemographic effects. Methods: A prospective cohort study of 690 Swedish women with primary BC, aged 24–63 years included after surgery. Descriptive statistics and adjusted logistic regression (age, birth country, education, self-rated health, treatment) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used. Results: Eighty percent of the women had experienced encounters regarding work. Women who got advice and support regarding work (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.5; 0.3–0.9) or were encouraged to work (adjusted OR 0.6; 0.3–0.9) had less SA. A larger proportion of those encouraged to work had less advanced cancer, surgery, hormone, or radiotherapy. Consistently, women encouraged to be on SA had more SA, but this was partly explained by disease or treatment factors (crude OR 1.6; 1.1–2.4, adjusted OR 1.2 (0.8–1.9) since a larger proportion of those with more advanced cancer, surgery, or chemotherapy had more SA.

Emerging evidence indicates that cytoprotective antioxidation is involved in drug resistance of various cancers; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we demonstrated that atypical protein kinase Cι (aPKCι) mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibition in a kinase-independent manner, which played a crucial role in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Mechanistically, we found that aPKCι facilitated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) accumulation, nuclear translocation and activated its target genes by competing with Nrf2 for binding to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) through a highly conserved DLL motif. In addition, the aPKCι-Keap1 interaction was required for antioxidant effect, cell growth and gemcitabine resistance in GBC. Importantly, we further confirmed that aPKCι was frequently upregulated and correlated with poor prognosis in patients with GBC. Collectively, our findings suggested that aPKCι positively modulated the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway to enhance GBC growth and gemcitabine resistance, implying that the aPKCι-Keap1-Nrf2 axis may be a potential approach to overcome the drug resistance for the treatment of GBC. © 2019","Atypical protein kinase Cι; Chemoresistance; Gallbladder cancer; Keap1-Nrf2 pathway; Reactive oxygen species",Article,Scopus

Methods: The [18F] FDG PET-CT imaging data of 394 patients who were newly diagnosed with cervical cancer (FIGO stage, Ia-IIa) were retrospectively studied. We measured size, total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of tumor, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), maximum and mean standardized uptake value (SUVmax, SUVmean) of tumor and lymph node (LN). Diagnostic efficiency was evaluated using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. We also investigated additional CT diagnosis information in PET-negative cases. Results: Our results indicated both lymph node and tumor parameters were independent risk factors for lymphatic metastasis in early-stage cervical cancer. The diagnosis based on above meaningful parameters, we name it ‘combination diagnosis’, offered significantly higher predictive value than that based on SUV measurement alone, which the values of AUC were 0.842 and 0.784 respectively (P < 0.05). In PET-negative cases, we also found that tumor TLG, suspicious LN in lymphatic drainage pathway, long/short axis of LN ≤ 2, heterogeneity of LN significantly associated with PLN metastasis. ROC analysis showed combination diagnosis of all these parameters above produced an AUC value of 0.859 (P < 0.05, 95% CI, 0.811–0.899), which was significantly higher than either using tumor TLG alone (AUC = 0.622, Z = 3.919, P < 0.05) or indices derived from CT alone (AUC = 0.727, 0.668, 0.695.

Patients and methods: Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed globally and in each trial, according to right-sided, transverse and left-sided primary colon cancer. Analysis was planned to provide overall and stage-specific results. Results: Individual data of 5239 patients were included in this analysis. The right-sided tumours were 1540 (29%), tumours originating in the transverse were 815 (16%) and left-sided tumours were 2884 (55%). At the multivariate analysis, DFS findings from the comparison of the right-sided versus left-sided tumours (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.89–1.14) were not statistically associated with clinical outcomes in the overall population.

Conclusion: This is the largest analysis demonstrating a prognostic effect of the tumour location on patients with colon cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Nevertheless, the effect is limited to OS in stage III colon cancer. In stage II tumours, the primary location has a lesser impact.

However, the poor bioavailability of curcumin triggers finding of new approaches for elevating its therapeutic efficiency. Purpose: We aimed to use gemini surfactant nanocarriers for curcumin in order to overcome its limitations. Study design: We investigated the in vitro characterization of gemini surfactant–curcumin (Gemini–Cur) and examined its antiproliferative & apoptotic activities on breast cancer cell lines. Methods: Gemini–Cur polymersomes were synthesized through nanoprecipitation method and characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission and scanning electron microscopies, HPLC and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The anticancer effect of Gemini–Cur nanoparticles was studied on three different breast cancer cell lines including MCF-7, SkBr-3 and MDA-MB-231 through uptake kinetics, viability & cytotoxicity recordings and apoptotic assays. Furthermore, qRT-PCR was performed to evaluate the expression of apoptotic genes including p16INK4a, p14ARF, Bax and Bcl-2. Results: According to physicochemical analysis, the average particle size, zeta potential value and drug entrapment efficiency for Gemini–Cur compound were recorded as 161 ± 6.2 nm, +5.32 mV and 89.13% ± 0.93, respectively. XRD analysis also confirmed the incorporation of curcumin in gemini surfactant micelles. Regarding the enhanced cellular uptake of sphere shaped Gemini–Cur, our data showed that this nano compound suppresses cancer cell proliferation via induction of apoptosis. Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis revealed that Gemini–Cur could effectively upregulate the expression of p16INK4a, p14ARF and Bax, while significantly decreasing the Bcl-2 expression in these breast cancer cells. Conclusion: Our data demonstrates the great potential of gemini surfactants for efficient delivery of curcumin and subsequently, the improvement of its anticancer effect. Therefore, it is sagacious to support the idea that Gemini–Cur nano compound might have the potential to be considered as an anticancer agent. © 2018","Apoptosis; Breast cancer; Cell cycle; Curcumin; Gemini–Cur",Article,Scopus

However, it is not known whether the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of nano-preparations are altered after co-spray drying. In this study, we compared the physicochemical property, anti-cancer activity, tumor targeting and pharmacokinetic behavior of docetaxel-loaded folic acid-conjugated liposomes (LPs-DTX-FA) with those of dry powder prepared by co-spray-drying LPs-DTX-FA. The particle size and PDI after re-dispersion of the powder were increased. The re-dispersed liposomes showed increased cellular uptake via micropinocytosis and exhibited higher cytotoxicity than LPs-DTX-FA. Tumor targeting of re-dispersed liposomes was less effective compared with LPs-DTX-FA but the metabolism of re-dispersed liposomes was decreased. Tracheal administration resulted in a 45-fold higher concentration of docetaxel in the lung of Sprague Dawley rats at 30 min as compared with intravenous administration. Our results indicated that co-spray drying did change the properties, while tracheal administration of the dry powder provided higher drug exposure at the tumor site without increasing the exposure of other organs. Thus, inhaled dry powders might be clinically effective for treatment of lung cancer. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Docetaxel; Folic acid; Inhaled dry powders; Liposome; Pharmacokinetics; Pulmonary delivery",Article,Scopus
